    title: "You Are Here: The Callback Hell Dungeon"
    body: |
      - You've battled async/await. You've survived Promise chains.
      - You've stared into the abyss of nested callbacks...
      - ...and the abyss stared back (with a TypeError)
      - You've googled "what is a monad" at 2am. We all have.
      - Today, we finally defeat the boss: CONFUSION
    speaker_notes: |
      This is the "I see you" moment. Everyone relates to callback hell.

      Make them feel seen, not judged.
    image_concept: |
      SCENE: A humorous visualization of nested code blocks.

    title: "Category Theory: The Tutorial Level"
    body: |
      LORE DROP:
      
      - Category = A collection of things and connections between them
      - Objects = The things (could be types, sets, anything)
      - Morphisms = The connections (functions, transformations)
      - Composition = Chaining connections (f then g then h)
      
      Developer Translation:
      - It's literally just: things with functions between them
      - You're already living in categories. Every. Single. Day.
    speaker_notes: |
      Key insight: Make it click that they already know this.
      "When you write a function that takes A and returns B, you're creating a morphism."
      Reference: "It's like the tutorial level of an RPG - you're learning the controls."
    image_concept: |
      SCENE: Simple, clean category theory diagram.
      - Three distinct geometric shapes arranged in a triangle:
        - TOP: Circle (soft blue glow)

  # SLIDE 5: FUNCTORS - MAP POWER
  # ========================================
  - id: 5
    type: content
    title: "Functors: You've Already Got This Skill"
    body: |
      ABILITY UNLOCKED: FUNCTOR
      
      - [1,2,3].map(x => x * 2) gives you [2,4,6]
      - That's it. That's a Functor. You've been using them.
      
      The Pattern:
      - Take thing in container
      - Apply function to thing
      - Get new thing in SAME container type
      
      Common Containers:
      Array | Promise | Option | Result | Observable
    speaker_notes: |
      This is the "You already knew this" revelation.
      "Remember all those .map() calls? Functor. Every single one."
      Make them feel smart, not overwhelmed.
    image_concept: |
      SCENE: Functor transformation visualization.
      - LEFT side: Three boxes in a vertical column, each containing a simple shape
        - Box 1: Star
        - Box 2: Circle  
        - Box 3: Triangle
      - CENTER: Large transformation arrow pointing RIGHT, glowing purple
      - RIGHT side: Same three boxes (same color, same size - structure preserved)
        - Box 1: Larger star (transformed)
        - Box 2: Larger circle (transformed)
        - Box 3: Larger triangle (transformed)
      - The boxes themselves are IDENTICAL left and right
      - Only the contents have changed
      
      STYLE:
      - Clean vector illustration
      - Soft neon colors
      - Dark background
      
      EXPLICIT DIRECTIONS:
      - Transformation flows LEFT to RIGHT
      - Boxes are visually identical (same structure)
      - Only internal shapes change
      - Arrow points clearly to the RIGHT

  # SLIDE 6: MONOIDS - COMBINE POWER  
  # ========================================
  - id: 6
    type: content
    title: "Monoids: The Art of Smooshing"
    body: |
      ABILITY UNLOCKED: MONOID
      
      - Things that combine with a "nothing" element
      
      Examples You Know:
      - Numbers + 0 equals Addition (0 is identity)
      - Strings + "" equals Concatenation ("" is identity)
      - Arrays + [] equals Concat ([] is identity)
      - Functions + id equals Composition (id is identity)
      
      Video Game Translation:
      - It's like item stacking in your inventory
      - Combining two health potions = bigger health potion
      - Combining with "nothing" = same thing back
    speaker_notes: |
      The inventory metaphor works great here.
      "Think about how items stack in games. That's a monoid."
      The identity element is like having 0 of something.
    image_concept: |
      SCENE: Visual showing monoid combination.
      - LEFT side: Three colored orbs (representing values)
        - Red orb, Blue orb, Green orb - arranged vertically
      - CENTER: Combination zone with swirling effect
      - RIGHT side: One larger orb with mixed colors (combined result)
      - BELOW: An empty/transparent orb labeled as identity (combines with any, returns unchanged)
      - Flow arrows showing: orbs to combination to result
      
      STYLE:
      - RPG item aesthetic
      - Glowing, magical effect
      - Dark background with particle effects
      
      EXPLICIT DIRECTIONS:
      - Flow goes from LEFT to RIGHT (combination direction)
      - Identity orb is clearly empty/transparent
      - Arrows show: A + B = C pattern
      
      CONSTRAINTS:
      - No text
      - No characters
      - Family-friendly  
      - Original artwork only

  # SLIDE 7: MONADS - THE FINAL BOSS
  # ========================================
  - id: 7
    type: content
    title: "Monads: The Final Boss (You're Ready)"
    body: |
      FINAL ABILITY: MONAD
      
      - A Functor that can also flatten nested containers
      - Promise.then() chains? That's a Monad.
      - .flatMap() / .SelectMany()? Also Monad.
      
      The Pattern:
      - map: A<B> to (B to C) to A<C>
      - flatMap: A<B> to (B to A<C>) to A<C>  This is the magic
      
      Boss Battle Translation:
      - When functions return wrapped values, you need flatMap
      - It unwraps, applies, and rewraps in one move
      - No more Promise of Promise of Promise...
    speaker_notes: |
      This is the climax. Build it up but also demystify it.
      "You've been fighting this boss in disguise. Every .then() chain."
      The reveal: You already beat this boss. You just didn't know it had a name.
    image_concept: |
      SCENE: Visual showing monad flattening (bind operation).
      - LEFT: Three nested boxes (box inside box inside box)
        - Outer box: Purple glow
        - Middle box: Blue glow
        - Inner box: Green glow with a star inside
      - CENTER: Flatten transformation effect - like unwrapping
      - RIGHT: Single box with the star inside (flattened)
      - Arrow showing the transformation from LEFT to RIGHT
      - Additional visual: Small diagram showing sequence/chaining
      
      STYLE:
      - Clean but dramatic
      - Boss reveal aesthetic
      - Glowing, powerful effect
      
      EXPLICIT DIRECTIONS:
      - Nested boxes on LEFT
      - Flat result on RIGHT
      - Transformation flows LEFT to RIGHT
      - The CONTENT (star) is preserved through transformation

      - No text
      - No characters

      THE MAP (It All Connects):
      
      Category Theory is the framework
      which leads to Functors for transforming contents (preserve structure)
      which leads to Monoids for combining things (with identity)

      SIDE QUESTS TO ACCEPT:
      
      Immediate:
      - Use .map() consciously (it's a Functor!)
      - Notice when you're combining things (Monoids everywhere)

    - Understated observations that make people nod
    
  dont:
    - Gatekeeping ("real programmers do X")
    - Dated references that exclude people
    - Forced memes (if it feels forced, it is)
    - Overexplaining the joke
    - Punching down at any group
    - Cringe references
