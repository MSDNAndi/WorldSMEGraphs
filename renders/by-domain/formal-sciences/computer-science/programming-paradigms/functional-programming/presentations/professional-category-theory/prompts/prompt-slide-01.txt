PROFESSIONAL TITLE SLIDE FOR CATEGORY THEORY PRESENTATION - SLIDE 01

=== OVERVIEW ===
Create a professional, minimalist title slide for a technical presentation about Category Theory for .NET developers. The design must convey credibility, modernity, and relevance to the Microsoft ecosystem while maintaining a clean, uncluttered aesthetic suitable for professional software engineering audiences.

=== CANVAS AND LAYOUT ===
Image format: 16:9 widescreen landscape orientation (1920x1080 pixels equivalent composition)
Background: Pure white (#FFFFFF) covering the entire canvas
Overall style: Microsoft Design Language - flat, clean, modern, professional

=== BACKGROUND PATTERN ===
The white background has subtle geometric decoration:
- Starting from the TOP LEFT corner (coordinates 0,0), create a pattern of extremely faint diagonal lines
- Lines run from TOP LEFT to BOTTOM RIGHT at exactly 45-degree angle
- Lines are light gray (#F0F0F0), barely visible, very subtle
- Line spacing: approximately 80 pixels apart
- Lines should cover approximately the LEFT half of the canvas (from x=0 to x=960)
- Lines fade out gradually as they move toward the RIGHT side of the canvas
- This creates a subtle textured background that doesn't compete with text

=== TITLE TEXT ===
Position: CENTER of canvas, slightly ABOVE the vertical center
- X-coordinate: centered horizontally (x=960)
- Y-coordinate: approximately 450 pixels from TOP edge

Main title text: "Category Theory for .NET Developers"
- Font: Segoe UI or similar modern sans-serif (Microsoft ecosystem standard)
- Font weight: Semibold (600)
- Font size: 72 points equivalent
- Color: Deep navy blue (#1A237E) - professional and authoritative
- Alignment: Centered horizontally
- Letter spacing: Normal, readable
- Line breaks: "Category Theory" on first line, "for .NET Developers" on second line
- Vertical spacing between lines: 1.2x line height

=== SUBTITLE TEXT ===
Position: DIRECTLY BELOW the main title, with 40 pixels vertical gap
- X-coordinate: centered horizontally (x=960)
- Y-coordinate: approximately 620 pixels from TOP edge

Subtitle text: "Understanding Functors in C# and F#"
- Font: Segoe UI Light or similar
- Font weight: Light (300)
- Font size: 36 points equivalent
- Color: Medium gray (#546E7A) - softer, secondary text
- Alignment: Centered horizontally
- Letter spacing: Slightly wider than normal (+0.5pt)

=== .NET LOGO ELEMENT ===
Position: LOWER RIGHT corner of the canvas
- X-coordinate: 1700 pixels from LEFT edge (220 pixels from RIGHT edge)
- Y-coordinate: 900 pixels from TOP edge (180 pixels from BOTTOM edge)

Logo design:
- Shape: Rounded square (90x90 pixels)
- Corner radius: 12 pixels
- Gradient fill: Linear gradient from TOP LEFT to BOTTOM RIGHT
  - Start color (TOP LEFT): Microsoft Blue (#0078D4)
  - End color (BOTTOM RIGHT): Azure Blue (#50E6FF)
- This creates a smooth diagonal gradient flowing from TOP LEFT to BOTTOM RIGHT within the square
- No border, clean edges
- Subtle drop shadow: offset 4 pixels to RIGHT, 4 pixels DOWN, blur 8 pixels, color black at 10% opacity

Inside the rounded square:
- Display stylized ".NET" text
- Font: Bold sans-serif
- Font size: 28 points equivalent
- Color: White (#FFFFFF)
- Position: Centered within the square both horizontally and vertically
- The letters should be crisp and clearly readable

=== DECORATIVE CODE ELEMENTS ===
These elements add technical context without being distracting. They must be VERY faint and positioned carefully.

Element 1 - Curly brackets:
Position: LEFT side of canvas, near the vertical center
- X-coordinate: 200 pixels from LEFT edge
- Y-coordinate: 500 pixels from TOP edge
Characters: A pair of curly brackets { }
- Font: Consolas or similar monospace font
- Font size: 120 points equivalent
- Color: Very light gray (#E8E8E8) - barely visible
- Opacity: 30%
- Orientation: Normal, vertical
- Spacing: 20 pixels between the opening { and closing } brackets

Element 2 - Lambda symbol:
Position: RIGHT side of canvas, ABOVE the .NET logo
- X-coordinate: 1650 pixels from LEFT edge
- Y-coordinate: 300 pixels from TOP edge
Character: Greek lowercase lambda (λ)
- Font: Georgia or similar serif font (to distinguish from sans-serif title)
- Font size: 140 points equivalent
- Color: Very light gray (#E8E8E8) - barely visible
- Opacity: 30%
- Orientation: Normal, upright

Element 3 - Arrow symbols:
Position: Scattered in the UPPER RIGHT area
- First arrow: at coordinates (1500, 180) - pointing RIGHT (→)
- Second arrow: at coordinates (1550, 240) - pointing RIGHT (→)
- Third arrow: at coordinates (1450, 270) - pointing RIGHT (→)
- Font: Arial or similar sans-serif
- Font size: 48 points equivalent
- Color: Very light gray (#E8E8E8) - barely visible
- Opacity: 25%
- Each arrow is the simple Unicode arrow character (→) pointing to the RIGHT
- Arrows should NOT overlap with the title text

=== AUTHOR/CREDIT LINE ===
Position: BOTTOM CENTER of canvas, near the BOTTOM edge
- X-coordinate: centered horizontally (x=960)
- Y-coordinate: 1020 pixels from TOP edge (60 pixels from BOTTOM edge)

Text: "WorldSMEGraphs Education Team"
- Font: Segoe UI or similar sans-serif
- Font weight: Regular (400)
- Font size: 20 points equivalent
- Color: Light gray (#9E9E9E) - unobtrusive
- Alignment: Centered horizontally

=== VISUAL HIERARCHY AND BALANCE ===
The composition should have:
1. Clear focal point: The main title in navy blue is the strongest visual element
2. Secondary focus: The subtitle in medium gray supports the title
3. Tertiary elements: The .NET logo provides brand context
4. Background elements: Decorative symbols add technical atmosphere without distraction
5. Whitespace: Generous spacing around all elements creates a professional, breathable design

=== COLOR PALETTE SUMMARY ===
- Background: Pure white (#FFFFFF)
- Background pattern lines: Very light gray (#F0F0F0)
- Main title: Deep navy blue (#1A237E)
- Subtitle: Medium gray (#546E7A)
- .NET logo gradient: Microsoft Blue (#0078D4) to Azure Blue (#50E6FF)
- .NET text: White (#FFFFFF)
- Decorative elements: Very light gray (#E8E8E8) at 25-30% opacity
- Author text: Light gray (#9E9E9E)

=== STYLE NOTES ===
- Professional: Suitable for corporate/enterprise presentation
- Modern: Current Microsoft design aesthetic (2024-2026)
- Technical: Subtle code elements establish technical context
- Credible: Navy blue and clean layout convey authority
- Readable: High contrast between text and background
- Uncluttered: Generous whitespace, minimal decoration
- Accessible: Color choices work for color-blind audiences (tested against WCAG standards)

=== TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS ===
- Resolution: High resolution, suitable for large display (presentation screen)
- Format: PNG with transparency support (though background is white)
- Color space: sRGB for consistent display across devices
- Anti-aliasing: Enabled for all text and shapes for smooth rendering
- Export quality: Maximum quality, no compression artifacts

=== WHAT TO AVOID ===
- Do NOT use gradients in the background (background must be solid white with only subtle line pattern)
- Do NOT make decorative elements too prominent (they must be VERY faint)
- Do NOT crowd the composition (maintain generous whitespace)
- Do NOT use colors outside the specified palette
- Do NOT place text or elements too close to edges (maintain 40+ pixel margins except for specified corner elements)
- Do NOT use shadow effects except on the .NET logo (where specified)
- Do NOT add additional decorative elements beyond those specified
- Do NOT make the .NET logo larger than 90x90 pixels
- Do NOT place any element in a way that obscures or competes with the title text

=== VALIDATION CHECKLIST ===

=== CREATIVE DIRECTION ===
This slide should immediately communicate:
1. "This is a professional, technical presentation"
2. "This is relevant to .NET developers"
3. "This content is credible and well-designed"
4. "The presentation will be clear and accessible, not overly academic"

The viewer should feel that this is a high-quality, modern technical presentation suitable for a professional software engineering conference or corporate training session. The design should inspire confidence in the content quality.
