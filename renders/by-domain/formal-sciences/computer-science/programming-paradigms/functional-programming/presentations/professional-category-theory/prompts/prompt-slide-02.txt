CONTENT SLIDE: "WHY FUNCTORS MATTER" - SLIDE 02

=== OVERVIEW ===
Create a professional educational diagram slide showing the connection between familiar C# LINQ code and the abstract concept of functors from category theory. The goal is to make developers realize they ALREADY use functors daily (via LINQ's Select method) before introducing the formal mathematical concept. This slide must be crystal clear, visually balanced, and use the Microsoft professional aesthetic established in slide 01.

=== VISUAL HIERARCHY ===
1. Title and subtitle establish topic (TOP)
2. LEFT zone shows familiar code (entry point)
3. CENTER functor box is visual focal point (strongest color, gradient)
4. Arrows show conceptual flow from LEFT to RIGHT (code → concept → theory)
5. RIGHT zone shows abstract theory (destination)
6. BOTTOM key insight reinforces learning (takeaway)

=== EDUCATIONAL FLOW ===
The visual flow moves from LEFT to RIGHT:
1. Audience recognizes C# code (comfort zone)
2. Arrows connect code to functor concept (revelation)
3. Functor box is prominent (importance emphasized)
4. Connection to abstract theory shown (optional deeper learning)
5. Key insight reinforces the practical message (retention)

This creates an "aha moment" - developers realize they already understand functors through LINQ.

=== STYLE NOTES ===
- Professional: Corporate-appropriate design
- Educational: Clear information hierarchy
- Progressive disclosure: Moves from concrete (code) to abstract (theory)
- Encouraging: "You already know this!" message boosts confidence
- Microsoft ecosystem: Colors and style consistent with .NET branding

=== TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS ===
- Resolution: High resolution for presentation display
- Format: PNG
- Color space: sRGB
- Anti-aliasing: Enabled for all text and shapes
- Export quality: Maximum

=== WHAT TO AVOID ===
- Do NOT make code blocks contain actual readable code (they are stylized representations)
- Do NOT make mathematical symbols too prominent (they should be faint/decorative)
- Do NOT crowd the diagram (maintain clear spacing between zones)
- Do NOT use colors outside specified palette
- Do NOT make arrows cross or overlap confusingly
- Do NOT add additional elements beyond specification
- Do NOT make the functor box smaller than specified (it's the focal point)
- Do NOT use diagonal or curved arrows (arrows should be straight, horizontal)

=== VALIDATION CHECKLIST ===
✓ Background is pure white
✓ Title "Why Functors Matter" is at TOP CENTER (960, 80)
✓ Subtitle hook line is centered below title
✓ LEFT zone shows two stylized code blocks with labels
✓ CENTER zone has gradient functor box (810, 480)
✓ RIGHT zone has faint mathematical symbols arranged vertically
✓ Arrows flow from LEFT to RIGHT with clear direction
✓ Arrow labels ("implements", "generalizes to") are readable
✓ Key insight box is at BOTTOM CENTER (960, 880)
✓ All colors match hex codes exactly
✓ Visual hierarchy is clear (code → functor → theory)
✓ Spacing is generous, no crowding
✓ Functor box is the strongest visual element (gradient, shadow)
✓ No additional elements beyond specification

=== CREATIVE DIRECTION ===
This slide should make developers think:
1. "Oh, I already use that in LINQ!"
2. "So Select is implementing a functor pattern"
3. "This isn't scary math - it's practical programming"
4. "I want to learn more about category theory now"

The design should be encouraging and demystifying, not intimidating. The visual flow from familiar code to abstract concept should feel natural and logical.
