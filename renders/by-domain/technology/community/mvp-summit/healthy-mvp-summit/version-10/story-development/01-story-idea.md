# Version 10: "The Great Coffee Conspiracy"

## Story Concept
Marco becomes convinced there's a "coffee conspiracy" at the summit—why does everyone crash at the same time? His investigation (with Andreas as his reluctant Watson) uncovers the science of caffeine timing, revealing that the real conspiracy is their own biology.

## Theme
Scientific discovery through humor, caffeine education, timing optimization

## Character Notes

### Marco Casalaina (Friendlier Characterization)
