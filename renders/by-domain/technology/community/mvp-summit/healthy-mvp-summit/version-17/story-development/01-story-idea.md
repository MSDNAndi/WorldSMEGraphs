# Healthy MVP Summit V17 - Story Idea

## Title: "The Summit Recipe: A Culinary Guide to Conference Survival"

## Version: 17.0
## Style: 1950s Cooking Show/Recipe Book Parody (Julia Child-esque narration, recipe metaphors)
## Target: 50+ panels (organically determined by narrative needs)

---

## Unique Narrative Concept

This story uses a **COOKING SHOW / RECIPE BOOK** framework where Andreas is a master "Summit Chef" teaching Marco the "recipes" for conference success. Each health lesson is presented as a recipe with ingredients, measurements, timing, and common mistakes. The metaphor of cooking - where precise ingredients and timing create success or disaster - perfectly maps to health protocols.

**The Hook**: "Welcome to 'The Conference Kitchen' where today, we'll be preparing the most complex dish of all: A Successfully Survived Summit. Get your ingredients ready, set your timers, and whatever you do... don't burn the coffee."
