# Version 9: "Summit Speedrun: Any% Healthy Completion" - Full Narrative

## Act One: The Tutorial Level (Panels 1-12)

"Watch this," Marco Casalaina announced to no one in particular, his bald head gleaming under the conference center lights as he pulled up the MVP Summit schedule on his phone. "I'm going to attend EVERY. SINGLE. SESSION. today."

Andreas Erben looked up from his coffee, rectangular dark-framed glasses catching the morning light. "That's... mathematically impossible. Some sessions run concurrently."

"Then I'll speed-walk between rooms. Catch the last half of one, sprint to the next, absorb maximum knowledge per minute." Marco's dark eyebrows waggled with competitive enthusiasm. "It's like a speedrun. Any% completion."

"I don't think conferences work that way," Andreas said gently, adjusting his charcoal vest.

"That's loser talk, Andreas. That's the talk of someone who hasn't optimized their session routing algorithm." Marco was already moving toward the first keynote, practically bouncing. "Keep up!"

By 10am, Marco had attended three sessions, asked questions in two of them, and was vibrating with caffeine and ambition.

By noon, he had sat through six consecutive hours with only bathroom breaks.

By 2pm, he was dead.

Not literally dead—but conference dead. The specific kind of dead where your brain refuses to absorb another word, your eyes have stopped focusing, and you find yourself reading the same slide three times without comprehension.

"The performance degradation is significant," Andreas observed, finding Marco slumped in a quiet corner near the expo hall. "You've hit the wall."

"I don't... walls don't..." Marco blinked slowly. "Words are hard now."

Andreas sat down beside him, pulling out a small notebook. "Let me explain something. In gaming terms."

Marco perked up slightly. "Gaming terms I understand."

"Your approach has been pure DPS—damage per second, maximum output, no regard for sustainability. But conferences aren't boss fights. They're endurance raids."

"Endurance... raids..."

"You need tank stats. Stamina. Recovery mechanics." Andreas drew a simple diagram. "The human body has resource pools: hydration, blood sugar, cognitive bandwidth, sleep debt. You've been draining all of them without any regeneration."

Marco stared at the diagram. "I've been speedrunning... wrong."

"You've been speedrunning like someone who doesn't know about save states."

## Act Two: Skill Unlock (Panels 13-24)

The next morning, Marco approached Andreas with unusual humility.

"Teach me," he said. "Teach me the meta."

Andreas smiled. "First lesson: the power nap. Twenty minutes, ideally between 2 and 3pm. It's like a quick rest at a bonfire in Dark Souls—minimal time investment, maximum restoration."

"But I'll miss sessions!"

"You'll miss one session. But you'll actually ABSORB the other four you attend. Would you rather be at 100% for four sessions or 40% for six?"

Marco did the math. "The numbers... the numbers support your hypothesis."

"Second lesson: hydration checkpoints." Andreas showed him a simple app. "Set a timer. Every hour, 8 ounces of water. Think of it like consuming mana potions throughout the dungeon instead of chugging them all at the boss."

"Why didn't anyone teach me this before?"

"Because you were too busy speedrunning to read the tutorial."

Marco laughed—a genuine, self-aware laugh. "Fair. What else?"

"Strategic session selection. You don't have to attend everything. Look at the schedule like a skill tree—what builds toward your goals? What's filler content?"

"Cut the filler, max the core skills. Got it."

"And finally—movement buffs. Standing at least once per hour. A short walk between sessions. Your body is like a laptop that throttles when it overheats. Movement is the cooling fan."

By Day Two, Marco was transformed. He attended fewer sessions but remembered them better. He napped at 2:15pm and woke up sharp. He drank water like it was a competitive event.

And he started helping others.

"Hey—you've been in that same seat for three hours," Marco told a young MVP. "Time for a movement buff. Come walk the expo hall with me."

"A what?"

"Trust me. Your CPU is throttling. You need air flow."

## Act Three: Co-op Mode (Panels 25-36)

Word spread. The speedrunner had discovered the meta, and he was sharing his strats.

By Day Three, a small group had formed around Marco and Andreas's methodology. They called themselves "The Healthy Completionists"—a guild dedicated to finishing the summit at 100% health rather than 100% sessions.

"Morning status report," Marco announced to the group of eight gathered at breakfast. "How's everyone's HP?"

"Seven hours sleep," reported Kenji.

"Ate an actual dinner with vegetables," said Sarah.

"Did the hotel gym this morning," added Marcus.

"That's XP you're farming," Marco nodded approvingly. "You're building a character who can go the distance."

Andreas watched from the side, quietly pleased. Marco had gone from chaotic speedrunner to guild leader in 48 hours—and his natural enthusiasm, once a liability, was now motivating others.

"You know what I realized?" Marco said to Andreas during a walking break. "The sessions aren't the point."

"No?"

"The sessions are the CONTENT. But the GAME is surviving with energy to spare. Being present enough to actually network, actually learn, actually enjoy it. That's the real achievement."

"That's... actually quite wise."

"Don't sound so surprised. Even speedrunners can learn."

The final day brought one last challenge: the evening party. Free alcohol. Late hours. The traditional conference destroyer.

"This is the final boss," Marco told the group. "And I have a strategy."

## Act Four: 100% Healthy Completion (Panels 37-48)

Marco's party strategy was simple: alternate alcoholic drinks with water, eat before drinking, and leave by 10pm.

"But the networking!" protested Marcus. "The best conversations happen after midnight!"

"The best conversations happen when you can REMEMBER them," Marco countered. "Tell me: what did you talk about at last year's party after 11pm?"

Marcus paused. "I... honestly don't remember."

"Case closed."

The group deployed as a unit. They had each other's backs—if someone ordered a second drink too quickly, another would slide a water their way. If someone got trapped in a conversation vortex, another would engineer an exit.

At 10pm, they left together. Sober enough to remember, social enough to have made real connections, tired enough to sleep well.

The next morning—departure day—Marco stood in the lobby with Andreas, both of them looking annoyingly well-rested.

"Final stats," Marco said, checking his fitness tracker. "Seven hours average sleep. 35,000 steps over three days. Zero hangovers. Four genuine professional connections I'll actually follow up on. And—" he tapped his temple "—I actually remember the sessions."

Andreas smiled. "Achievement unlocked: 100% Healthy Completion."

"You know what's funny? I used to think conferences were about surviving. White-knuckling through the exhaustion. Bragging about how little you slept."

"And now?"

"Now I realize that was just being bad at the game. The real flex isn't suffering. It's thriving."

A young MVP approached them hesitantly. "Excuse me—are you the speedrun guy? Someone told me you have... strategies?"

Marco's face lit up with his characteristic enthusiastic grin. "Do I have strategies? Pull up a chair, friend. Let me tell you about the meta."

Andreas shook his head with warm amusement as Marco launched into his lecture. The student had become the teacher. The speedrunner had learned that the best strategy wasn't speed—it was sustainability.

And somewhere, a leaderboard updated:

**MVP Summit 2024 - Healthy Completion**
1. Marco Casalaina - 100%
2. Andreas Erben - 100%
3-9. The Healthy Completionists - 100%

GG.

THE END
