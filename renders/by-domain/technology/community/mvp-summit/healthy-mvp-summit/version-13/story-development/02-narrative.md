## PROLOGUE: THE FIRST CHOICE

### Panel 1
*Wide establishing shot. Microsoft Commons cafeteria, 6:00 AM. Early morning light streams through floor-to-ceiling windows. The cavernous space is nearly empty except for a few early risers. At the center coffee station stands MARCO CASALAINA - completely bald with a smooth shaved head, his most distinctive feature, no glasses, wearing a dark navy blue blazer over a white open-collar dress shirt with a small sheep lapel pin. He reaches for an espresso machine, eyes still bleary from the red-eye flight.*

**CAPTION BOX**: "Microsoft Campus, Redmond. Day One of the MVP Summit. 6:00 AM."

**MARCO (thought bubble)**: "Jet-lagged. Exhausted. Need coffee. All the coffee."

---

### Panel 2
*Close-up on Marco's hand reaching for the espresso button. Behind him, the air begins to shimmer and crackle with blue-white energy. Other early morning coffee-seekers don't seem to notice.*

**SFX**: CRACKLE... ZZZZAP!

**MARCO (thought bubble)**: "Maybe a triple shot to start..."

---

### Panel 3
*A swirling portal of crackling energy tears open in the middle of the cafeteria, casting dramatic shadows. Marco spins around, eyes wide with shock. From the portal, a FIGURE begins to emerge - humanoid, stumbling.*

**SFX**: WOOOOOOSH!

**MARCO**: "What the—?!"

---

### Panel 4
*ANDREAS VARIANT ALPHA stumbles through the portal, nearly collapsing. He has the same face as Andreas Erben - rectangular dark-framed glasses with thick black plastic frames, thinning sandy-blonde hair with M-shaped receding hairline - but he looks TERRIBLE. Dark circles under his bloodshot eyes, sweat on his forehead, hands trembling violently, a coffee cup seemingly fused to his grip. A faint BLUE GLOW surrounds him.*

**ANDREAS-ALPHA**: "WAIT! Don't... don't touch that espresso machine!"

**MARCO**: "Who ARE you?!"

---

### Panel 5
*Andreas-Alpha grabs Marco's arm with desperate intensity, spilling some of his own coffee. The blue aura around him flickers. Behind them, the portal begins to stabilize.*

**ANDREAS-ALPHA**: "I'm you... I mean, I'm HIM... I mean... look, just LISTEN! I'm Andreas Erben from a different timeline. And if you don't understand what caffeine ACTUALLY does to your brain... you'll end up like ME."

**MARCO**: "Different... timeline? You look like you haven't slept in days!"

**ANDREAS-ALPHA**: "I HAVEN'T! And it all started with one bad coffee decision at exactly this moment!"

---

## ACT 1: THE CAFFEINE MULTIVERSE

### Panel 6
*The portal behind them expands, pulling Marco and Andreas-Alpha into it like a vortex. The cafeteria spins away into a tunnel of blue light. Marco's coffee cup goes flying.*

**SFX**: WHOOOOOOOOOP!

**ANDREAS-ALPHA**: "Let me SHOW you!"

**MARCO**: "AAAAAH!"

---

### Panel 7
*They emerge in the SAME cafeteria, but now it's clearly a different timeline - the clock shows 7:30 AM, and everything has a slight blue tint. Timeline Alpha's Andreas is at the coffee station, looking healthy and alert, loading up his SIXTH espresso.*

**CAPTION BOX**: "Timeline Alpha - 7:30 AM"

**ANDREAS-ALPHA (narrating, pointing at his past self)**: "That's me. Three hours ago. I'd already had five espressos. This was my sixth."

**PAST-ALPHA-ANDREAS**: "One more for energy! It's going to be a great day!"

---

### Panel 8
*Educational insert panel. A human brain diagram with caffeine molecules (shaped like coffee cups) blocking adenosine receptors (shown as sleepy-face symbols trying to dock). Arrows show the mechanism.*

**CAPTION BOX**: "CAFFEINE SCIENCE: Caffeine blocks adenosine receptors. Adenosine is your brain's 'tired' signal. But it doesn't STOP adenosine production - just hides it."

**DIAGRAM LABELS**: 
- "CAFFEINE MOLECULE" (blocking)
- "ADENOSINE" (building up behind)
- "RECEPTOR" (blocked)
- "ADENOSINE BACKLOG: GROWING!"

---

### Panel 9
*Timeline jump. Same blue-tinted reality, now showing a conference room at 2:00 PM. Past-Alpha-Andreas is in a keynote session, but his head is drooping. The caffeine has worn off and ALL that blocked adenosine is hitting him at once. Other attendees look concerned.*

**CAPTION BOX**: "Timeline Alpha - 2:00 PM - The Crash"

**PAST-ALPHA-ANDREAS (slurred speech bubble)**: "Can't... focus... so... tired..."

**NEARBY ATTENDEE (whispering)**: "Is that guy okay?"

**ANDREAS-ALPHA (narrating)**: "The half-life of caffeine is 5-6 hours. By 2 PM, ALL that blocked adenosine hit me like a freight train. I crashed so hard I drooled on my laptop."

---

### Panel 10
*Split panel. Left side: Past-Alpha-Andreas at 11:00 PM, wide awake in his hotel bed, eyes HUGE, staring at ceiling, coffee cup on nightstand. Right side: A clock showing "HALF OF CAFFEINE STILL ACTIVE."*

**CAPTION BOX**: "Timeline Alpha - 11:00 PM - The Insomnia"

**PAST-ALPHA-ANDREAS**: "Why... can't... I... SLEEP?!"

**ANDREAS-ALPHA (narrating)**: "Even though I'd crashed at 2 PM, all that caffeine from my 6 PM 'pick-me-up' was still 50% active at 11 PM. I lay there for FOUR HOURS."

---

### Panel 11
*Marco looks horrified. Andreas-Alpha's blue aura flickers more intensely. They're still in the blue-tinted timeline.*

**MARCO**: "So you... you're stuck in a loop of exhaustion and over-caffeination?"

**ANDREAS-ALPHA**: "I drank MORE coffee the next morning to compensate. And MORE. And MORE. Now I can't function without it but it stopped WORKING. I've destroyed my adenosine sensitivity!"

---

### Panel 12
*A new portal opens - this one GOLDEN, warm, stable. From it steps PRIME ANDREAS ERBEN - looking healthy, well-rested, confident. Same rectangular dark-framed glasses, same thinning sandy-blonde hair with M-shaped receding hairline, but in good condition. He wears a charcoal quilted vest over a light blue button-down shirt with a conference lanyard. No strange aura.*

**SFX**: FWOOOOOM!

**PRIME ANDREAS**: "Alpha, you really need to stop traumatizing the newcomers."

**MARCO**: "Another one?!"

**PRIME ANDREAS**: "I'm Andreas too. From the 'Prime Timeline' - where I actually learned how to use caffeine STRATEGICALLY. Let me show you what SHOULD happen."

---

### Panel 13
*Educational montage panel showing Prime Andreas's caffeine strategy. Three-part image: Morning (90 minutes after waking, first coffee with sunshine), Afternoon (small coffee at 1 PM before slump), Evening (water and tea only, clock showing 6 PM cutoff).*

**CAPTION BOX**: "THE STRATEGIC CAFFEINE PROTOCOL"

**PANEL 1 LABEL**: "DELAY FIRST COFFEE: Wait 90-120 min after waking. Let cortisol peak naturally."

**PANEL 2 LABEL**: "MODERATE DOSE: 75-150mg (one medium coffee) before anticipated slump."

**PANEL 3 LABEL**: "6-HOUR CUTOFF: No caffeine after 5-6 PM to protect sleep."

**PRIME ANDREAS**: "Your body has a natural alertness system. Work WITH it, not against it."

---

### Panel 14
*The blue-tinted world of Timeline Alpha begins to dissolve around Andreas-Alpha. He waves goodbye, fading but looking relieved that Marco might be saved.*

**ANDREAS-ALPHA**: "Make... better choices... than I did..."

**SFX**: FADE... SHIMMER...

**MARCO**: "Will he be okay?"

**PRIME ANDREAS**: "Maybe. If YOU make the right choice in the Prime Timeline, his timeline might never exist."

**MARCO**: "This is a lot to process."

**PRIME ANDREAS**: "Oh, we're just getting started. There are more timelines you need to see."

---

## ACT 2: THE SLEEP APOCALYPSE

### Panel 15
*Microsoft Commons, lunch time. Marco and Prime Andreas are eating - Andreas has a salad with water, Marco is learning and has chosen similarly. The atmosphere is normal, prime-timeline colors.*

**CAPTION BOX**: "Prime Timeline - Day 1, 12:30 PM"

**MARCO**: "So I've had my ONE strategic coffee, I'm feeling good, and I've got three sessions picked for this afternoon. This is working!"

**PRIME ANDREAS**: "Excellent. But the real test comes tonight..."

---

### Panel 16
*Behind them, a second portal tears open - this one BLOOD RED, ominous, pulsing with dark energy. Both turn to look. The air around it seems to drain of color.*

**SFX**: KRRRRRACK-BOOOOOM!

**MARCO**: "Oh no. Another one?"

**PRIME ANDREAS (sighing)**: "I was hoping we'd skip Beta."

---

### Panel 17
*ANDREAS VARIANT BETA staggers through the portal. He has the same rectangular dark-framed glasses and thinning sandy-blonde M-shaped hairline as the others, but he is DEVASTATED. Extreme bags under bloodshot eyes, three-day stubble, wrinkled clothes, swaying on his feet. A deep RED GLOW pulses around him like a heartbeat.*

**ANDREAS-BETA**: "The dreams... the DREAMS won't stop..."

**MARCO**: "What happened to you?!"

**ANDREAS-BETA**: "I... I thought I could handle a few drinks..."

---

### Panel 18
*Flashback-style panel showing Timeline Beta's Andreas at a networking reception, holding what's clearly his fourth cocktail, laughing with a group. Everything has a reddish tint.*

**CAPTION BOX**: "Timeline Beta - Day 1, 8:00 PM - The Reception"

**PAST-BETA-ANDREAS**: "One more round! The night is young! We're NETWORKING!"

**ANDREAS-BETA (narrating)**: "It started innocently. A glass of wine with dinner. Then whiskey with the Windows team. Then more whiskey. Then..."

---

### Panel 19
*Educational diagram panel showing sleep architecture. Top half: NORMAL SLEEP with proper REM cycles. Bottom half: ALCOHOL-DISRUPTED SLEEP with suppressed early REM and fragmented second half.*

**CAPTION BOX**: "ALCOHOL AND SLEEP ARCHITECTURE"

**TOP DIAGRAM**: "Normal Sleep: Healthy REM cycles (shown in purple blocks), restorative deep sleep"

**BOTTOM DIAGRAM**: "Alcohol Sleep: REM suppressed in first half → REBOUND fragmentation in second half → You 'sleep' 8 hours but get 4 hours of actual rest"

**SCIENCE NOTE**: "Alcohol is metabolized at 0.015% BAC per hour. When it wears off mid-sleep, your brain goes into REM overdrive - causing nightmares, sweating, and constant waking."

---

### Panel 20
*Timeline Beta hotel room, 3:00 AM. Past-Beta-Andreas is tangled in sweaty sheets, eyes wide with nightmare terror, reaching out. The room has a nightmarish quality - shadows too dark, angles slightly wrong.*

**CAPTION BOX**: "Timeline Beta - Day 2, 3:00 AM"

**PAST-BETA-ANDREAS**: "NO! THE PRESENTATION! THE SLIDES ARE EATING ME!"

**ANDREAS-BETA (narrating)**: "The REM rebound hit around 3 AM. Vivid nightmares. Woke up every 20 minutes. Drenched in sweat. My brain was trying to recover all the REM it lost in the first half of the night."

---

### Panel 21
*Morning after. Past-Beta-Andreas at breakfast, staring blankly at his plate, dark circles, unable to focus. A cup of coffee sits untouched - even caffeine can't help.*

**CAPTION BOX**: "Timeline Beta - Day 2, 8:00 AM"

**PAST-BETA-ANDREAS**: "I... I can't remember what sessions I wanted to attend. I can't remember the conversations from last night. I can't remember..."

**ANDREAS-BETA (narrating)**: "Alcohol impairs memory consolidation. All those networking contacts? The brilliant ideas? Gone. My hippocampus couldn't process any of it during sleep because it was busy fighting the alcohol damage."

---

### Panel 22
*Andreas-Beta grabs Marco by the shoulders, desperate, the red aura pulsing faster. Prime Andreas watches with sympathy.*

**ANDREAS-BETA**: "And I DID IT AGAIN the second night! And the third! Now I'm permanently behind on sleep, my brain is mush, and I can't remember WHY I even came to this conference!"

**MARCO**: "How do I avoid your fate?!"

---

### Panel 23
*Prime Andreas gently pulls Beta back, calming him. He holds up a hand showing a simple strategy.*

**PRIME ANDREAS**: "The harm reduction approach. Not zero, but strategic."

**PRIME ANDREAS (speech bubble with list)**:
"• Maximum 2 drinks total
• Stop drinking 4 hours before bed
• Alternate with water 1:1
• Choose clear spirits (fewer congeners, less hangover)
• Eat before AND during
• Know your 'done' time: 9:30 PM"

---

### Panel 24
*The red-tinted world of Timeline Beta begins to dissolve. Andreas-Beta fades, but his expression shifts from torment to something like hope as he watches Marco learning.*

**ANDREAS-BETA**: "Maybe... maybe you'll do better..."

**SFX**: FADE... SHIMMER...

**MARCO**: "Two timelines down. How many more are there?"

**PRIME ANDREAS**: "A few. And the next one is... particularly painful to witness."

---

## ACT 3: THE DECISION SINGULARITY

### Panel 25
*Conference session selection area. Giant screens show dozens of sessions happening simultaneously. Marco stares at the overwhelming options, schedule in hand, looking stressed. Prime Andreas watches.*

**CAPTION BOX**: "Prime Timeline - Day 1, 2:00 PM - Session Selection"

**MARCO**: "There are FORTY sessions in this time slot! The AI one looks good but so does the security one and the Azure one and—"

**SFX (behind Marco)**: BZZZZZT-CRACK!

---

### Panel 26
*A YELLOW portal sparks into existence, chaotic and unstable, showering yellow sparks everywhere. From it emerges ANDREAS VARIANT GAMMA - same glasses, same hairline, but with a frozen, overwhelmed expression. He's surrounded by FLOATING POST-IT NOTES, CALENDARS, and SCHEDULE FRAGMENTS that orbit him like debris. A YELLOW GLOW radiates outward in stressed pulses.*

**ANDREAS-GAMMA**: "Too... many... choices... can't... decide..."

**MARCO**: "Another you?"

**PRIME ANDREAS**: "Gamma tried to optimize everything. He ended up optimizing nothing."

---

### Panel 27
*Educational diagram showing a brain as a battery with decision-making power levels. Morning shows 100% full. Each decision icon (clothes, breakfast, email, meetings) drains it by 5-10%. By evening, it's nearly empty.*

**CAPTION BOX**: "DECISION FATIGUE: THE HIDDEN ENERGY DRAIN"

**DIAGRAM**: Brain-battery showing:
- "6 AM: 100% Decision Power"
- "Each decision: -5-10%"
- "By 4 PM: <20% remaining"
- "Critical decisions with depleted battery = POOR CHOICES"

**SCIENCE NOTE**: "The brain doesn't distinguish between trivial and important decisions. Choosing breakfast depletes the same resource as choosing sessions. Smart attendees PRE-DECIDE trivial matters to save capacity for what matters."

---

### Panel 28
*Timeline Gamma flashback (yellow tint). Past-Gamma-Andreas standing at the SAME session board, trying to PHYSICALLY attend three sessions by running between rooms. He's split into GHOST IMAGES of himself running in different directions.*

**CAPTION BOX**: "Timeline Gamma - Day 1"

**PAST-GAMMA-ANDREAS**: "If I catch the first 10 minutes of AI, then sprint to Security, then catch the end of Azure—"

**ANDREAS-GAMMA (narrating)**: "I tried to attend EVERYTHING. Every session had value. Every connection might be important. Every choice felt CRITICAL."

---

### Panel 29
*Timeline Gamma, evening. Past-Gamma-Andreas sits in a hallway, back against wall, surrounded by scattered notes, staring blankly. His brain-battery icon hovers above him showing 2%.*

**CAPTION BOX**: "Timeline Gamma - Day 1, 7:00 PM"

**PAST-GAMMA-ANDREAS**: "What... what should I eat for dinner? Where should I sit? Should I network or rest? I can't... I can't decide anything anymore..."

**ANDREAS-GAMMA (narrating)**: "By evening, I had used every drop of decision-making energy on trivial choices. When the IMPORTANT decisions came - which leaders to approach, what to discuss, how to represent myself - I had nothing left. I either avoided the decision or made impulsive bad ones."

---

### Panel 30
*Marco looks at his own packed schedule, then at the floating chaos around Gamma, making the connection. Prime Andreas nods approvingly.*

**MARCO**: "So if I try to decide everything in the moment..."

**ANDREAS-GAMMA**: "You'll have nothing left for what matters!"

**PRIME ANDREAS**: "The solution is pre-deciding. BEFORE the conference even starts."

---

### Panel 31
*Prime Andreas holds up his phone showing a simple, clean schedule with only THREE items per time slot, color-coded, with decisions already made.*

**PRIME ANDREAS**: "I pick my top three sessions each day BEFORE I arrive. I know where I'm eating. I know when I'm taking breaks. I pre-decided everything trivial so my brain is fresh for the conversations and insights that can't be predicted."

**PHONE SCREEN**: 
"DAY 1:
• 9 AM: Keynote (non-negotiable)
• 11 AM: AI Session (primary) 
• 2 PM: FREE - Choose based on energy
• 4 PM: Networking (strategic)
• 7 PM: Dinner - Building 34 cafeteria
• 9:30 PM: Return to hotel"

---

### Panel 32
*Marco pulls out his own phone and starts simplifying his schedule, deleting half the sessions, marking decisions as "pre-decided."*

**MARCO**: "So I'm not being lazy by choosing less - I'm being strategic?"

**PRIME ANDREAS**: "Exactly. You can always ADD something if energy permits. But starting with everything and hoping to keep up? That's the Gamma path."

---

### Panel 33
*The yellow chaos around Andreas-Gamma begins to settle. The floating post-its gently land and dissolve. His frozen expression softens as he fades.*

**ANDREAS-GAMMA**: "Choose... less... decide... better..."

**SFX**: FLUTTER... FADE...

**MARCO**: "Three down. What's next?"

**PRIME ANDREAS**: "The energy crisis. And this one... hits close to home for introverts."

---

## ACT 4: THE ENERGY CRISIS

### Panel 34
*A crowded networking reception in Building 33. The room is PACKED with people, conversations overlapping, name tags everywhere. Marco stands with Prime Andreas at the edge, looking slightly overwhelmed.*

**CAPTION BOX**: "Prime Timeline - Day 1, 5:30 PM - Networking Reception"

**MARCO**: "There must be 400 people in here. I should talk to ALL of them!"

**PRIME ANDREAS**: "Should you, though? Let me introduce you to someone..."

---

### Panel 35
*A PURPLE portal opens in a quiet corner of the reception. ANDREAS VARIANT DELTA emerges - same glasses, same hairline, but his body language is completely different. He's hunched, hands up as if shielding himself, eyes darting nervously. A depleted PURPLE GLOW surrounds him like a dying ember.*

**ANDREAS-DELTA (whispered)**: "Too many people... too many conversations... need to hide..."

**MARCO**: "What happened to you?"

**ANDREAS-DELTA**: "I forgot that I'm an introvert."

---

### Panel 36
*Educational diagram showing two battery gauges side by side. One labeled "EXTROVERT" fills UP during social interaction. One labeled "INTROVERT" drains DOWN during the same interaction.*

**CAPTION BOX**: "INTROVERSION vs EXTROVERSION: ENERGY DYNAMICS"

**DIAGRAM**:
- **Extrovert Battery**: Social interaction → Arrow pointing UP → "Gains energy from interaction"
- **Introvert Battery**: Social interaction → Arrow pointing DOWN → "Spends energy on interaction"
- **Key insight**: "Neither is better. Both need to understand their pattern."

**SCIENCE NOTE**: "Introverts have higher baseline cortical arousal. Social stimulation easily tips them into overstimulation. Extroverts have lower baseline arousal and NEED social stimulation to reach optimal levels. Knowing your type determines your recharge strategy."

---

### Panel 37
*Timeline Delta flashback (purple tint). Past-Delta-Andreas at hour ONE of the reception, energetically shaking hands, smiling broadly, full battery icon above his head.*

**CAPTION BOX**: "Timeline Delta - Hour 1"

**PAST-DELTA-ANDREAS**: "Great to meet you! And you! Let's connect! Here's my card! Tell me about your project!"

**ANDREAS-DELTA (narrating)**: "I started strong. I ALWAYS start strong. The problem is I don't know when to STOP."

---

### Panel 38
*Timeline Delta flashback, hour THREE. Same reception. Past-Delta-Andreas is now cornered by a talkative group, his smile frozen and plastic, battery icon showing 10%, eyes slightly glazed.*

**CAPTION BOX**: "Timeline Delta - Hour 3"

**PAST-DELTA-ANDREAS (thought bubble)**: "I need to get out of here but I can't figure out how to exit this conversation and there are more people I should meet and maybe just five more minutes..."

**ANDREAS-DELTA (narrating)**: "I pushed through the discomfort. Told myself to 'be more extroverted.' Ignored every signal my brain was sending."

---

### Panel 39
*Timeline Delta, next day. Past-Delta-Andreas is hiding in a bathroom stall, sitting on the closed toilet, head in hands, battery icon showing 0% with a critical warning.*

**CAPTION BOX**: "Timeline Delta - Day 2"

**PAST-DELTA-ANDREAS**: "I can't go back out there. I can't talk to anyone. I need to hide for the rest of the conference..."

**ANDREAS-DELTA**: "I burned out so completely that I missed the ENTIRE second day hiding in my hotel room. All those connections I forced on day one? Worthless. I had no energy to follow up."

---

### Panel 40
*Prime Andreas puts a hand on both Marco and Delta's shoulders, bringing them together. He shows his phone with a schedule that includes "RECHARGE BREAKS" blocked in green.*

**PRIME ANDREAS**: "The secret isn't avoiding networking. It's scheduling RECOVERY."

**PRIME ANDREAS (pointing at schedule)**:
"• 15 minutes alone after every 45 minutes of intense interaction
• A quiet walk between buildings
• Strategic bathroom breaks that are actually 'me-time'
• Permission to leave events BEFORE you're empty
• Quality conversations > quantity of cards collected"

**ANDREAS-DELTA (fading, relieved)**: "Listen to him... protect your energy..."

---

## ACT 5: THE FOMO PARADOX

### Panel 41
*Prime Timeline, Day 2 morning. Marco checks his phone and sees social media posts from other attendees at sessions he's not attending. His face shows the beginning of anxiety.*

**CAPTION BOX**: "Prime Timeline - Day 2, 10:00 AM"

**PHONE SCREEN** (multiple social posts):
- "Amazing AI demo happening RIGHT NOW!"
- "Security session MIND BLOWN!"
- "The Azure announcements are 🔥🔥🔥"

**MARCO**: "Wait, I'm missing the AI demo? And there's a security session? Should I leave this session? Should I—"

---

### Panel 42
*An ORANGE portal tears open in the conference hallway. ANDREAS VARIANT EPSILON emerges - but he doesn't simply step through. He appears as MULTIPLE OVERLAPPING GHOST IMAGES of himself, each running in a different direction, none fully solid. An ORANGE GLOW fragments around him like shattered glass.*

**ANDREAS-EPSILON (overlapping speech from multiple mouths)**: "Can't miss AI!" "Security is crucial!" "Azure updates!" "Networking now!" "EVERYTHING IMPORTANT!"

**PRIME ANDREAS**: "Epsilon tried to be everywhere at once."

**MARCO**: "He looks like he's... fragmenting?"

**PRIME ANDREAS**: "He is. He experienced NOTHING fully because he was always thinking about what he was MISSING."

---

### Panel 43
*Educational diagram showing the FOMO cycle. A figure splits into multiple ghost versions, each one fainter than the last. Social media icons and highlight reels surround the fragmenting figure.*

**CAPTION BOX**: "THE FOMO PARADOX"

**DIAGRAM**: 
- Center: "YOU" (single solid figure)
- Arrows pointing to multiple sessions with "WHAT IF I'M MISSING SOMETHING?"
- Ghost versions of figure at each session, all faded
- Result: "Experience everything at 20% = Experience nothing fully"

**CONTRAST BOX**: 
- "JOMO (Joy of Missing Out)"
- Single solid figure at ONE session, fully engaged
- "Experience one thing at 100% = Actually remember and benefit"

**SCIENCE NOTE**: "Social media shows curated 'highlight reels.' Comparing your full experience to others' best moments creates anxiety. The person posting 'amazing AI demo!' might have been bored 5 minutes later."

---

### Panel 44
*Timeline Epsilon flashback (orange tint). Past-Epsilon-Andreas is literally RUNNING through a hallway, phone in BOTH hands, sweating, trying to live-tweet one session while reading about another.*

**CAPTION BOX**: "Timeline Epsilon - Day 1"

**PAST-EPSILON-ANDREAS**: "If I sprint, I can catch 10 minutes of each session! I'll scroll through the hashtag for what I missed! I'll network during bathroom breaks! I'll sleep on the plane home!"

**ANDREAS-EPSILON (narrating, fragmented)**: "I ran... everywhere... captured nothing... remembered less..."

---

### Panel 45
*Timeline Epsilon, end of Day 2. Past-Epsilon-Andreas sits alone, surrounded by thousands of photos and tweets he took but never experienced. His expression is empty. He's holding his phone but staring through it.*

**CAPTION BOX**: "Timeline Epsilon - Day 2, End"

**PAST-EPSILON-ANDREAS**: "I... I was at everything. I have proof. But I can't remember any of it. I didn't... actually BE anywhere."

**ANDREAS-EPSILON**: "The fear of missing out made me miss EVERYTHING."

---

### Panel 46
*Marco puts his phone AWAY, physically into his pocket. Prime Andreas nods approvingly. The fragmenting Epsilon watches with longing.*

**MARCO**: "So the answer is... accepting that I CAN'T be everywhere?"

**PRIME ANDREAS**: "Better than that. It's CHOOSING where to be and being FULLY there. Three priorities per day. Full presence. No phones during sessions. Trust that the sessions you miss will be recorded or irrelevant."

---

### Panel 47
*Epsilon's fragmented ghost-images slowly merge back together as he fades, becoming ONE solid person again for just a moment before dissolving completely. His final expression is peaceful.*

**ANDREAS-EPSILON (unified voice, fading)**: "Be... somewhere... fully..."

**SFX**: MERGE... SHIMMER... FADE...

**PRIME ANDREAS**: "That's all of them. The five paths of destruction. And you've seen them all."

**MARCO**: "Caffeine crashes, alcohol sleep destruction, decision paralysis, social burnout, and FOMO fragmentation. That's... a lot of ways to ruin a conference."

---

## EPILOGUE: THE INTEGRATED TIMELINE

### Panel 48
*Evening. A cozy bar in downtown Bellevue. Warm lighting, Pacific Northwest aesthetic - exposed wood, craft beer taps (though neither character is drinking beer). Marco and Prime Andreas sit at a quiet corner table with glasses of SPARKLING WATER with lime. No alcohol in sight.*

**CAPTION BOX**: "Bellevue, Washington - Day 1, 9:15 PM"

**MARCO**: "I have to say... this is not how I expected my first MVP Summit day to go."

**PRIME ANDREAS (smiling)**: "Multiverse portals aside, how do you feel?"

---

### Panel 49
*Marco counts on his fingers, looking genuinely surprised and pleased. Through the bar window behind them, we can see the faint, ethereal outlines of the five variant Andreases - Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, and Epsilon - watching from outside, their glows dim but visible.*

**MARCO**: "I had ONE coffee, timed perfectly. I'm not jittery or crashed. I attended THREE sessions fully instead of twelve partially. I took real breaks. And now I'm here with sparkling water instead of my fifth whiskey."

**MARCO**: "I feel... GOOD? At a conference? That's never happened before."

---

### Panel 50
*Close-up on Prime Andreas, warm smile, the face of someone who's seen many timelines and found the right path.*

**PRIME ANDREAS**: "Every variant you met is a version of myself who made different choices at key moments. They're not bad people - they're me without the knowledge."

**PRIME ANDREAS**: "Now YOU have the knowledge. You don't have to repeat anyone's mistakes."

---

### Panel 51
*Wide shot of the bar. In the background, through the window, the five variant Andreases begin to fade away - their timelines becoming less probable as Marco makes better choices. It's subtle, almost unnoticeable unless you're looking.*

**MARCO**: "Do they... do they just disappear? If I make the right choices?"

**PRIME ANDREAS**: "Let's just say that better choices collapse certain timelines. Maybe they're getting their second chance too."

---

### Panel 52
*Marco checks his watch - simple, classic. 9:30 PM. He looks at Prime Andreas with newfound respect and understanding.*

**MARCO**: "We should head back. Early session tomorrow."

**PRIME ANDREAS**: "9 AM keynote. Which means 7 AM breakfast, 90 minutes before first coffee, and bed by 11."

**MARCO**: "You've really got this down to a science."

**PRIME ANDREAS**: "I've lived enough bad timelines to appreciate the good one."

---

### Panel 53
*Final panel. Wide establishing shot of Marco and Prime Andreas walking out of the bar into the Bellevue evening. Street lights glow warmly. The Microsoft campus is visible in the distance. Above them, in the night sky, five faint colored streaks - blue, red, yellow, purple, and orange - fade into the stars like closing portals. Marco walks with confidence. Andreas walks with satisfaction.*

**CAPTION BOX**: "And somewhere, across the multiverse, five variants got a second chance at Day 2."

**PRIME ANDREAS**: "See you at 7?"

**MARCO**: "I'll bring the water bottles."

**CAPTION BOX - FINAL**: "THE END... for now. Tomorrow: Day 2."

---
