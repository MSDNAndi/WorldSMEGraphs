## Story Hook

In a neon-lit future vision of the MVP Summit, two tech champions discover that their greatest optimization isn't in code—it's in themselves. As hextech energy pulses through the campus, they must balance their power systems to survive the summit.

## Central Theme

"Every champion needs a recharge cycle. Your performance depends on your power management."

## Story Arc (HIGH LEVEL)

### Act 1: Power Diagnostics (Panels 1-8)
- Opening: Neon-lit Microsoft campus at dawn, hextech architecture
- Andreas checking his health metrics orb, energy levels low
- Marco arrives with analytical overlay showing their "champion stats"
- Discussion: Many attendees running on empty, ignoring warnings
- Setting the goal: Complete the summit at peak performance

### Act 2: The Energy Crisis (Panels 9-16)
- Sessions draining power - visualized as energy bars depleting
- Hydration station as "mana fountain" - restoring hex energy
- Nutrition choices as power-ups vs debuffs
- Mid-day crash visualization - systems going dark
- Power nap as "repair mode" sequence

### Act 3: Calibration Protocols (Panels 17-24)
- Walking the campus - each step restoring energy
- Eye strain as "visual overload" - cooling down systems
- Strategic session selection - resource allocation
- Networking as "energy exchange" - give and take

### Act 4: The Evening Protocol (Panels 25-32)
- Social events as "multiplayer mode" - coordinated wellness
- Alcohol as system interference - managing buffs carefully
- Finding quiet zones - power save mode
- Sleep preparation - entering deep charge cycle

### Act 5: Champion Status (Panels 33-40)
- Next morning - fully recharged and ready
- Comparing to crashed attendees - the difference is clear
- Sharing protocols with others - spreading the knowledge
- Summit success - leaving stronger than arriving
- Final image: Two champions silhouetted against neon sunrise
