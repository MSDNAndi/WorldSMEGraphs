## Pre-Summit Preparation

### Sleep Schedule Adjustment
- Start adjusting 3 days before travel
- Shift sleep time by 1-2 hours toward destination timezone
- Avoid caffeine after 2 PM on adjustment days

### Packing Essentials
- **Comfortable shoes** for walking the campus (4-5 miles/day typical)
- **Reusable water bottle** (hydration critical)
- **Healthy snacks** (nuts, protein bars) to avoid buffet-only eating
- **Compression socks** for long flights
- **Eye mask and earplugs** for hotel sleep quality

## Daily Health Strategies

### Morning Routine (6:00-8:00 AM)

1. **Exercise first** - 15-30 minute walk, jog, or hotel gym session
2. **Hydrate immediately** - Glass of water before coffee
3. **Healthy breakfast** - Protein and fiber, not just pastries
4. **Strategic caffeine** - First cup, save second for afternoon slump

### During Sessions (8:00 AM - 5:00 PM)

#### Seating Strategy
- **Back row for breaks** - Easy exit without disturbing others
- **Near aisle for movement** - Stretch legs without blocking
- **Visible clock area** - Time awareness without phone checks

#### Movement Breaks
- Stand during Q&A portions
- Bathroom breaks = walking opportunities
- Take stairs between floors
- Walk during lunch instead of sitting

#### Eye Care - The 20-20-20 Rule
- Every **20 minutes**, look at something **20 feet away** for **20 seconds**
- Reduces screen fatigue significantly
- Set phone reminder if needed

#### Posture
- Feet flat on floor
- Back supported against chair
- Screen at eye level when possible
- Roll shoulders every 30 minutes

### Afternoon Recovery (12:00-2:00 PM)

#### Power Nap Protocol
- **When**: After lunch, before afternoon sessions
- **Duration**: 15-20 minutes maximum (avoid deep sleep)
- **Location**: Quiet corner, hotel room, or outdoor bench
- **Trick**: "Coffee nap" - drink coffee, nap 15 min, wake as caffeine kicks in

#### Post-Lunch Slump Prevention
- Avoid heavy carbs at lunch
- Light walk after eating (10-15 minutes)
- Caffeine timing: between 1-2 PM optimal

### Evening Events (5:00-10:00 PM)

#### Alcohol Moderation
- **Hydration ratio**: One water for every alcoholic drink
- **Pacing**: One drink per hour maximum
- **Food first**: Eat before drinking
- **Stop time**: Last drink 2+ hours before bed

#### Networking Energy Management
- **Introverts**: Plan recharge breaks (quiet time in room)
- **Extroverts**: Pace yourself, you have multiple days
- **Quality over quantity**: Deep conversations > collecting business cards

## Mental Health Strategies

### FOMO Management (Fear Of Missing Out)

- **Accept you can't do everything** - Choose priorities
- **Trust the content availability** - Sessions often recorded
- **Your health > One more session** - Tired you learns nothing
- **The hallway track counts** - Informal connections valuable

### Decision Fatigue Prevention

- **Pre-plan sessions** - Review schedule night before
- **Pack outfit night before** - One less morning decision
- **Standard breakfast order** - Reduce choice overload
- **Default healthy choices** - Commit before options appear

### Overwhelm Signs to Watch

- Difficulty concentrating in sessions
- Irritability with minor issues
- Physical exhaustion despite sleep
- Skipping meals or hydration
- Avoiding people you want to meet

---

## Buddy System

### Why It Works
- Mutual accountability for healthy choices
- Someone to take breaks with
- Backup if you feel unwell
- Shared healthy restaurant choices

### Buddy Commitments
1. Morning exercise together
2. Check hydration at each session break
3. Healthy dinner at least one night
4. Alert each other to fatigue signs
5. Early night accountability (at least one night)

## Emergency Recovery

### If You Overdo It

**Day 1 Recovery Plan:**
1. Sleep in (skip one morning session if needed)
2. Light breakfast, heavy hydration
3. Outdoor walk before sessions
4. Power nap after lunch
5. Early dinner, no alcohol, early bed

### Signs You Need to Rest

- Can't follow session content
- Headache persisting after hydration
- Unable to socialize effectively
- Dreading activities you looked forward to
