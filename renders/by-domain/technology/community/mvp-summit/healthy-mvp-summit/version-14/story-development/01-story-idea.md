## Unique Narrative Concept

This story uses a **FILM NOIR DETECTIVE** framework where Marco is an investigator called in to solve the mystery of "The Conference Crasher" - a phenomenon where brilliant attendees inexplicably burn out and fail at the summit. Through investigation, interrogation, and piecing together clues, Marco discovers that the real culprit is a series of health mistakes, with Andreas as his informant who knows the truth.

**The Hook**: Day Zero. A promising MVP candidate found slumped in Building 33, unable to remember his own session topic. The third this week. Someone - or someTHING - is sabotaging the summit's brightest minds. Marco is called in to investigate.

## Story Structure (Noir Investigation Framework)

### Act 1: The Crime Scene (Panels 1-8)
**Setting**: Building 33 conference room, 8:00 AM, day before summit officially starts
**Action**: Marco arrives at the "crime scene" - a promising attendee found slumped over their laptop, unable to remember their presentation. Security footage shows no intruder. Marco begins his investigation, noting coffee cups, disrupted schedule, signs of exhaustion.
**Mystery Hook**: "No one attacked this person physically. So what destroyed their mind?"
**AKU Clue**: Initial setup for all suspects

### Act 2: The Informant Appears (Panels 9-16)
**Setting**: Shadows of a campus building, venetian blind lighting
**Action**: Andreas appears from the shadows, offering to help. He reveals he was once a victim too - years ago. He survived and learned the truth. But Marco must SEE the evidence to believe it. Andreas takes Marco to interview the victims.
**Character Dynamic**: Trust building between Marco and Andreas
**AKU Focus**: Andreas's backstory hints at multiple health failures

### Act 3: Interrogating the Jitters (Panels 17-24)
**Setting**: Hospital-style recovery room, then flashback to coffee station
**Action**: Marco interviews "Coffee Carl" who's recovering from a massive caffeine crash. Through flashback, they witness Carl's descent - 8 espressos before noon, the adenosine tsunami at 2 PM, the 3 AM insomnia.
**Evidence Collected**: Caffeine half-life calculations, adenosine receptor diagram, timing charts
**Suspect Profile**: The Jitters - "It promises energy but delivers debt"
**AKU Focus**: pharm-002 presented as forensic evidence

### Act 4: Tracking the Night Thief (Panels 25-32)
**Setting**: Hotel room (crime scene), flashback to networking reception

**Evidence Collected**: Sleep architecture diagrams as "autopsy reports," blood alcohol timeline
**Suspect Profile**: The Night Thief - "It steals your memories while you sleep"
**AKU Focus**: pharm-001 presented as crime reconstruction

### Act 5: Confronting the Brain Drain (Panels 33-38)
**Setting**: Conference hallway with overwhelming session boards
**Action**: Marco finds "Calendar Ken" frozen in front of session options, unable to move. Andreas explains decision fatigue - the invisible robbery of cognitive resources. The creature is everywhere, in every trivial choice.

**Suspect Profile**: The Brain Drain - "It takes a little from every choice until nothing remains"
**AKU Focus**: psych-001 presented as resource theft

### Act 6: Exposing the Energy Vampire (Panels 39-44)

### Act 8: The Revelation (Panels 52-58)
**Setting**: Quiet rooftop overlooking campus at sunset

**Andreas's Confession**: He was once victim to ALL five. He learned. Now he teaches.
**Resolution**: The "case" is closed - the perpetrator is the self, and the defense is awareness.

### Epilogue: The Prevention Protocol (Panels 59-62)
