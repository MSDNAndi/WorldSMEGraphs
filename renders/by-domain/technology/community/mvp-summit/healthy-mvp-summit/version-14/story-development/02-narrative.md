## ACT 1: THE CRIME SCENE

### Panel 1
*Rain-slicked streets of Redmond at dawn. Dramatic noir lighting - streetlamps creating pools of light in the darkness. A lone figure walks toward the Microsoft campus, collar up against the rain. This is MARCO CASALAINA - completely bald with a smooth shaved head (revealed as rain drips off), his most distinctive feature. He wears a dark trenchcoat over his signature navy blue blazer, a fedora pulled low (though we can see his bald head at the temples), and his small sheep lapel pin glints in the light.*

**CAPTION BOX (Marco's hardboiled narration)**: "They called me at 5 AM. Third one this week, they said. Another bright mind, burned out before the summit even started. Something was hunting the MVPs of Microsoft... and it was my job to find out what."

---

### Panel 2
*Interior of Building 33, a modern conference room. Crime scene tape (metaphorical - actually a "Do Not Disturb" barrier). A young male attendee ("COFFEE CARL") is slumped over a laptop, empty espresso cups scattered around him like shell casings. Two worried Microsoft staff members stand nearby.*

**MARCO (removing fedora, revealing his completely bald head)**: "Walk me through what happened."

**STAFF MEMBER**: "He was fine yesterday. Energetic. Prepared. This morning we found him like this. He can't remember his own presentation topic."

**MARCO**: "Any signs of external attack?"

**STAFF MEMBER**: "None. Security cameras show nothing. He did this to himself... somehow."

---

### Panel 3
*Close-up on Marco examining the scene like a detective. His blue-grey eyes scan the evidence: eight empty espresso cups, a schedule crammed with every possible session, a phone showing 47 unread messages.*

**CAPTION BOX**: "The evidence was all there. I just didn't know how to read it yet. Eight cups of coffee. A schedule with no margins. A phone that never stopped buzzing. The victim had been surrounded by weapons... and didn't even know it."

---

### Panel 4
*Marco picks up one of the espresso cups, examining it like evidence. Light streams through venetian blinds, casting dramatic shadows across his face and bald head.*

**MARCO**: "When did he start drinking these?"

**STAFF MEMBER**: "First thing this morning. 6 AM. He said he needed 'fuel for the big day.'"

**MARCO (thought bubble)**: "Six AM. Eight cups by what... 10 AM? That's not fuel. That's a ticking time bomb."

---

### Panel 5
*Wide shot of the conference room, noir-styled with dramatic shadows. Marco stands in the center, the victim still slumped in the foreground. Through the window, the rainy campus is visible.*

**CAPTION BOX**: "This wasn't the first victim. I'd seen the files. 'Networking Nancy' - found hiding in a bathroom stall, unable to face another handshake. 'Calendar Ken' - frozen in front of a session board, paralyzed by options. All brilliant. All destroyed."

**MARCO**: "There's a pattern here. Something connecting these cases."

---

### Panel 6
*A shadow falls across Marco's face. He turns. In the doorway, partially obscured by darkness, stands ANDREAS ERBEN - recognizable by his rectangular dark-framed glasses with thick black plastic frames, his thinning sandy-blonde hair with M-shaped receding hairline. He wears his charcoal quilted vest but with the collar up, shrouded in mystery.*

**ANDREAS (from shadows)**: "You won't find the answer in the coffee cups, detective."

**MARCO**: "Who are you?"

**ANDREAS**: "Someone who survived what's killing them. Someone who knows the truth about The Conference Crasher."

---

### Panel 7
*Close-up on Andreas's face, half in shadow, half in the venetian blind light. His glasses catch the light. His expression is knowing, haunted.*

**ANDREAS**: "My name is Andreas Erben. Years ago, I was like them. I almost didn't make it out. Now I help others... when they're ready to listen."

**MARCO**: "You know what's doing this?"

**ANDREAS**: "Not WHAT. WHO. And it's not a single perpetrator. It's five. Five assassins that work together. And every victim invited them in."

---

### Panel 8
*Two-shot of Marco and Andreas, facing each other across the crime scene. The victim between them. Tension in the composition.*

**MARCO**: "Five assassins? At a tech conference?"

**ANDREAS**: "They have names. The Jitters. The Night Thief. The Brain Drain. The Vampire. The Phantom. Each one targets a different weakness. Each one is invisible until it's too late."

**MARCO**: "That's insane."

**ANDREAS**: "Then explain him." *gestures at the victim* "Explain the others. No physical attacker. No poison detected. Just... destruction from within."

**CAPTION BOX**: "He was either crazy or he knew something. In my experience, those two things often looked the same at first."

---

## ACT 2: THE INFORMANT APPEARS

### Panel 9
*Campus pathway at night, rain still falling. Marco and Andreas walk together, their breath visible in the cold air. Dramatic noir lighting from campus lamps.*

**MARCO**: "Tell me about these... assassins."

**ANDREAS**: "Not yet. First you need to understand what you're looking at. The victims aren't dead - they're depleted. Something consumed their mental resources until nothing was left."

---

### Panel 10
*Andreas leads Marco to a bench under an awning, out of the rain. He sits, looks up at the wet campus. His expression is distant, remembering.*

**ANDREAS**: "Ten years ago, I was the most promising MVP candidate of my cohort. I knew everything about Azure, could present in my sleep, had more energy than anyone."

**MARCO**: "What happened?"

**ANDREAS**: "The summit happened. Or rather... I LET it happen TO me."

---

### Panel 11
*Flashback panel - sepia-toned, dreamy edges. A YOUNGER ANDREAS (same glasses, same hairline but more hair) is at a conference reception, drink in hand, surrounded by people, looking exhausted but pushing through.*

**ANDREAS (narrating)**: "I drank too much coffee. Then too much alcohol to 'relax.' I tried to attend every session. I networked until I couldn't remember my own name. I chased every opportunity and caught none."

**YOUNG ANDREAS**: "Just one more drink... one more session... one more contact..."

---

### Panel 12
*Flashback - Young Andreas slumped in a bathroom stall, exactly like the victims. His glasses askew, hands shaking.*

**ANDREAS (narrating)**: "By day three, I was a shell. I couldn't give my presentation. I hid. I flew home early. I almost never came back to an MVP summit."

---

### Panel 13
*Back to present. Andreas looks at Marco directly, the flashback fading. His expression is serious.*

**ANDREAS**: "But I did come back. Because I learned the truth. The five assassins aren't supernatural - they're biological. Psychological. Scientific. And every single one can be defeated... if you know how."

**MARCO**: "Show me."

---

### Panel 14
*Andreas stands, pulling his vest tighter against the cold. He gestures toward the campus buildings.*

**ANDREAS**: "We'll need to interview the survivors. The ones who made it back from the edge. They can tell you what they saw. What hunted them. And how they escaped."

**MARCO**: "Lead the way."

---

### Panel 15
*Wide shot of Marco and Andreas walking toward the illuminated conference buildings. The rain is letting up. Stars are beginning to show.*

**CAPTION BOX**: "I didn't trust him yet. But I didn't have any better leads. And something in his eyes told me he'd been where these victims were... and lived to tell about it."

---

### Panel 16
*They stop outside a door marked "MEDICAL SERVICES - RECOVERY ROOM." Andreas puts his hand on the door.*

**ANDREAS**: "Behind this door is someone who met The Jitters face to face. He's recovering. But he remembers everything."

**MARCO**: "The Jitters. That's the caffeine one?"

**ANDREAS**: "That's the first assassin. Let's see what he has to say."

---

## ACT 3: INTERROGATING THE JITTERS

### Panel 17
*Interior of a small medical-style recovery room. "COFFEE CARL" (the first victim) is propped up in a chair, looking better but still shaky. IV fluids visible. Marco and Andreas enter.*

**CARL**: "You're investigating? Good. Someone needs to know what happened to me."

**MARCO (pulling out notebook)**: "Tell me everything. Start from the beginning."

---

### Panel 18
*Flashback - stylized, with a blue caffeine tint. Carl at the coffee station at 6 AM, healthy, loading up his first espresso. The espresso machine glows ominously.*

**CARL (narrating)**: "I woke up jet-lagged. Tired from the flight. The obvious solution was coffee. I'd had four shots before the first session even started."

**PAST-CARL**: "This is going to be the best summit ever! Maximum energy!"

---

### Panel 19
*Flashback continues. Carl in a session at 10 AM, absolutely WIRED. Leg bouncing. Taking frantic notes. The Jitters appears as a shadowy figure behind him - a personified caffeine entity with coffee-cup eyes, vibrating, whispering in his ear.*

**THE JITTERS (whispering)**: "More... you need MORE... one more shot and you'll be UNSTOPPABLE..."

**CARL (narrating)**: "By 10 AM I'd had eight espressos. I felt incredible. Invincible. I didn't realize I was being set up."

---

### Panel 20
*Educational "case file" insert panel. Styled like a detective's evidence board. Shows a brain diagram with adenosine receptors blocked by caffeine molecules, and a building pile of adenosine behind the block.*

**CASE FILE: THE JITTERS - BIOLOGICAL PROFILE**

**MECHANISM**: "Caffeine blocks adenosine receptors. Adenosine = brain's 'tired' signal. BUT adenosine continues building up behind the block."

**HALF-LIFE**: "5-6 hours. Caffeine from 6 AM is still 50% active at 12 PM, 25% at 6 PM, 12.5% at midnight."

**THE TRAP**: "High doses early = massive adenosine release when caffeine clears = THE CRASH"

---

### Panel 21
*Flashback. Carl at 2 PM, in the middle of a session. The caffeine is wearing off. The blocked adenosine is hitting all at once. Carl's head droops. His notes blur. The Jitters is gone - leaving only the crash.*

**CARL (narrating)**: "It hit at 2 PM like a wall. All that blocked tiredness came flooding back at once. I couldn't keep my eyes open. I drooled on my laptop. In front of everyone."

**PAST-CARL (slurred)**: "I'm... fine... just need... more... coff..."

---

### Panel 22
*Flashback. Carl at 11 PM in his hotel room, WIDE AWAKE, staring at the ceiling. Eyes huge. The 6 PM "pick-me-up" coffee is still half-active.*

**CARL (narrating)**: "I thought more coffee at 6 PM would fix the crash. It did - for a few hours. But at 11 PM, I was wired. I lay there until 3 AM. Didn't sleep at all."

**PAST-CARL**: "Why... can't... I... SLEEP?!"

---

### Panel 23
*Back to present. Carl grabs Marco's arm with desperate intensity.*

**CARL**: "The next day was worse. I drank MORE to compensate. Then crashed HARDER. It was a spiral. By day three I couldn't form sentences."

**MARCO**: "How do you beat it? The Jitters?"

---

### Panel 24
*Andreas steps forward, holding up a simple diagram: "THE PROTOCOL." His glasses catch the light.*

**ANDREAS**: "Strategy. Not abstinence. Strategy."

**ANDREAS'S PROTOCOL**:
- "Wait 90-120 minutes after waking before first coffee (let cortisol peak naturally)"
- "Moderate dose: 75-150mg (one medium coffee)"
- "Timing: before anticipated slump, not after"
- "6-hour cut-off before bed (10 hours for slow metabolizers)"
- "Work WITH adenosine, not against it"

**CARL**: "If only I'd known..."

---

## ACT 4: TRACKING THE NIGHT THIEF

### Panel 25
*Hotel room, evening. Crime scene lighting. Marco examines a disheveled bed - sweaty sheets, nightmare sketches on the nightstand, empty wine bottles by the bed. Andreas watches from the doorway.*

**CAPTION BOX**: "The second crime scene was harder to look at. Whatever happened here, it happened in the dark."

**MARCO**: "Who was the victim?"

**ANDREAS**: "A senior architect. Brilliant. Gave the best presentation of day one. By day three, she couldn't remember any of it."

---

### Panel 26
*Marco picks up the nightmare sketches - disturbing images of fragmented meetings, faceless crowds, presentations that dissolve.*

**MARCO**: "What are these?"

**ANDREAS**: "Her dreams. Or what was left of them. The Night Thief doesn't just steal your night. It steals your memories."

---

### Panel 27
*Flashback - stylized with a blood-red tint. A female attendee ("NETWORKING NANCY" - different person, this victim) at a reception, glass of wine in hand, laughing, surrounded by admiring colleagues. The Night Thief lurks in the shadows - an elegant, seductive figure with a wine-glass silhouette.*

**THE NIGHT THIEF (whispering)**: "One more won't hurt... you've earned it... you're NETWORKING..."

**VICTIM (narrating)**: "The reception was great. The wine was good. The connections were flowing. I lost count after glass four."

---

### Panel 28
*Educational "case file" insert. Styled as an autopsy report for sleep. Shows sleep architecture diagrams - normal vs. alcohol-disrupted.*

**CASE FILE: THE NIGHT THIEF - SLEEP ARCHITECTURE AUTOPSY**

**NORMAL SLEEP**: "Full REM cycles (purple blocks), memory consolidation, restoration"

**ALCOHOL SLEEP**: 
- "First half: REM suppressed (sedative effect)"
- "Second half: REM rebound = fragmentation, nightmares, sweating"
- "Result: 8 hours of 'sleep' = 4 hours of actual rest"

**MEMORY THEFT**: "Hippocampus consolidates memories during sleep. Disrupt sleep = memories never formed."

---

### Panel 29
*Flashback. The victim in bed at 3 AM, tangled in sweaty sheets, eyes wide with nightmare terror. The Night Thief hovers over her, drinking something invisible from her head - memories.*

**VICTIM (narrating)**: "The nightmares hit at 3 AM. Vivid. Terrifying. I woke every 20 minutes. The alcohol had worn off and my brain went into overdrive trying to recover."

---

### Panel 30
*Flashback. Morning. The victim at breakfast, staring at a notebook of contacts from the night before. Her expression is blank. She can't remember any of them.*

**VICTIM**: "Who is... 'Sarah - Azure team - great idea'? I don't... I can't remember meeting her. I can't remember ANY of them."

**VICTIM (narrating)**: "All those connections. All those conversations. Gone. My brain couldn't consolidate any of it because I was too busy fighting the alcohol damage."

---

### Panel 31
*Back to present. Marco closes his notebook, disturbed. Andreas watches him process.*

**MARCO**: "So the alcohol literally stole her memories?"

**ANDREAS**: "It stole her OPPORTUNITY to form them. The conversations happened. But without proper sleep, they were never transferred from short-term to long-term memory."

---

### Panel 32
*Andreas hands Marco a small card with harm reduction strategies. Simple, practical.*

**ANDREAS'S CARD**: "BEATING THE NIGHT THIEF"
- "Maximum 2 drinks total"
- "Stop 4 hours before bed"
- "Alternate with water 1:1"
- "Choose clear spirits (fewer congeners)"
- "Eat before AND during"
- "Hard stop: 9:30 PM"

**ANDREAS**: "You don't have to be a saint. You just have to be strategic. The Thief only wins when you give it everything."

---

## ACT 5: CONFRONTING THE BRAIN DRAIN

### Panel 33
*Conference hallway. Massive screens display dozens of session options. A male attendee ("CALENDAR KEN") stands frozen, schedule in hand, eyes darting between options. Marco and Andreas observe from a distance.*

**CAPTION BOX**: "The third victim wasn't unconscious. He was paralyzed. Standing in front of possibilities... unable to choose any."

**MARCO**: "What's wrong with him?"

**ANDREAS**: "The Brain Drain got him."

---

### Panel 34
*Close-up on Ken. His eyes are glassy. His hand trembles holding the schedule. Above his head, a BRAIN-BATTERY icon shows 3% remaining. The Brain Drain appears as a tentacled creature, invisible to Ken, draining something from his skull.*

**THE BRAIN DRAIN (whispering)**: "But what if you choose wrong? What if the other session is better? What if you miss something IMPORTANT?"

**KEN**: "I... I can't... there are 40 options... I need to... I can't..."

---

### Panel 35
*Flashback - yellow-tinted. Earlier that morning. Ken making decisions: what to wear, what to eat, which coffee, which table, who to sit with, which path to walk. Each decision drains his brain-battery by a small amount.*

**KEN (narrating)**: "I didn't realize decisions were expensive. Every choice I made - even tiny ones - cost something. By the time I reached the important decisions... there was nothing left."

---

### Panel 36
*Educational "case file" insert. Shows decision fatigue as resource depletion.*

**CASE FILE: THE BRAIN DRAIN - COGNITIVE ROBBERY**

**THE SCIENCE**: "Decision-making draws from a LIMITED cognitive resource. The brain doesn't distinguish trivial from important - each decision costs the same."

**THE TIMELINE**:
- "Morning: 100% capacity"
- "Each decision: -5-10%"
- "By afternoon: <20%"

**THE SYMPTOMS**: "Decision avoidance, impulsive choices, defaulting to easiest option, analysis paralysis"

**THE DEFENSE**: "Pre-decide trivial matters. Save capacity for what matters."

---

### Panel 37
*Marco approaches Ken gently. Ken can barely respond. Andreas hangs back.*

**MARCO**: "Hey. Ken. Look at me. What do you WANT to see today? Not what you SHOULD. What do you WANT?"

**KEN**: "I... I don't... I've been deciding for hours... I can't..."

---

### Panel 38
*Andreas steps forward, takes Ken's schedule, crosses out everything except three items.*

**ANDREAS**: "Here. Your decision is made. These three. The rest doesn't exist."

**KEN (visible relief flooding his face)**: "But... what if I miss..."

**ANDREAS**: "You'll miss things. Everyone misses things. The only question is whether you'll be PRESENT for what you choose... or absent from everything."

---

## ACT 6: EXPOSING THE ENERGY VAMPIRE

### Panel 39
*Packed networking reception in the Commons. Hundreds of people, overwhelming noise, name tags everywhere. Marco and Andreas stand at the edge, watching.*

**CAPTION BOX**: "The fourth crime happened in plain sight. In the most crowded room of the conference. And nobody noticed until it was too late."

---

### Panel 40
*They spot "NETWORKING NANCY" (a different Nancy, or same one from earlier recovered enough to walk around) trapped in a conversation. A group surrounds her. Her smile is frozen, plastic. Above her head, an ENERGY BATTERY icon shows 8%. The Energy Vampire lurks behind the group - elegant, refined, drinking invisible energy from her.*

**THE VAMPIRE**: "Just a few more conversations... it would be RUDE to leave... people are COUNTING on you..."

---

### Panel 41
*Nancy tries to step away but is pulled back by another handshake, another "just one more question." Her battery drops to 5%.*

**NANCY (thought bubble)**: "I need to get out of here I need to get out I can't breathe I can't think I need—"

**NEARBY PERSON**: "Oh Nancy! You HAVE to meet this person!"

---

### Panel 42
*Educational "case file" insert. Shows introvert vs. extrovert energy dynamics.*

**CASE FILE: THE ENERGY VAMPIRE - ENERGY ECONOMICS**

**INTROVERT PROFILE**:
- "Higher baseline cortical arousal"
- "Social interaction SPENDS energy"
- "Solitude RESTORES energy"
- "Need recovery time after intense socializing"

**EXTROVERT PROFILE**:
- "Lower baseline arousal"
- "Social interaction GENERATES energy"
- "Isolation DRAINS energy"
- "Need social contact to maintain energy"

**THE KEY**: "Neither is better. Both must understand their type and plan accordingly."

**THE VAMPIRE'S TRICK**: "Convincing introverts they should be extroverts."

---

### Panel 43
*Marco and Andreas intervene. Andreas smoothly extracts Nancy from the group with a practiced excuse. Marco blocks pursuers.*

**ANDREAS**: "Nancy! There you are! We need you for that urgent thing - you know the one."

**NANCY (eyes flooding with gratitude)**: "YES. The urgent thing. Sorry everyone, have to go!"

---

### Panel 44
*Quiet hallway. Nancy leans against a wall, breathing deeply. Her battery slowly ticks up: 10%... 15%... Andreas watches with knowing sympathy.*

**NANCY**: "How did you know?"

**ANDREAS**: "I've been there. I'm an introvert too. The Vampire almost got me my first three summits."

**ANDREAS**: "The secret is scheduling recovery. Fifteen minutes alone after every forty-five minutes of intense interaction. It's not antisocial. It's survival."

---

## ACT 7: CAPTURING THE PHANTOM

### Panel 45
*Day 2, 10 AM. Marco checks his phone. Social media is EXPLODING with posts from sessions he's not attending. His face shows the beginning of anxiety.*

**PHONE SCREEN**:
- "INCREDIBLE announcement in AI track!"
- "If you're not in Building 34 RIGHT NOW, you're missing out!"
- "The security talk is AMAZING"

**MARCO (thought bubble)**: "Wait, I'm missing the AI announcement? And security? Should I leave this session?"

---

### Panel 46
*The air shimmers. THE PHANTOM appears - a fragmenting, everywhere-and-nowhere specter, existing as multiple ghost images simultaneously. Orange glow. Whispering from all directions.*

**THE PHANTOM**: "You're missing it... you're missing EVERYTHING... better run... better HURRY..."

**MARCO**: "Andreas... what is that?"

**ANDREAS**: "The most dangerous one. The Phantom. FOMO given form."

---

### Panel 47
*Marco starts to chase the Phantom through the hallways, following glimpses of "amazing" sessions. But every time he gets to a door, the Phantom is already at the NEXT door. Always one step ahead.*

**CAPTION BOX**: "I chased it through Building 33. Then 34. Then the Commons. Everywhere I went, it was already somewhere else. And everywhere I'd been became instantly less important than where I wasn't."

---

### Panel 48
*Split panel showing Marco in multiple places simultaneously - all ghost images of himself, each one faded, none fully solid. He's becoming the Phantom.*

**MARCO (realization)**: "I'm... I'm splitting apart..."

**ANDREAS (grabbing his arm)**: "STOP. Stop chasing."

---

### Panel 49
*Educational "case file" insert. Shows the FOMO paradox.*

**CASE FILE: THE PHANTOM - THE FOMO PARADOX**

**THE TRAP**: "Social media shows curated highlights. Others' best moments vs. your full reality = unfavorable comparison."

**THE PURSUIT**: "Chasing everything = being present for nothing. Experience 10 sessions at 20% = less than 1 session at 100%."

**THE CURE - JOMO**: "Joy of Missing Out. Accepting that choosing IS missing. The missed sessions were probably 80% filler anyway."

**THE PROTOCOL**: "Three priorities per day. Full presence. Phone away during sessions."

---

### Panel 50
*Marco stops running. He breathes. He looks at Andreas, who is fully solid, fully present, not chasing anything.*

**MARCO**: "How do you not chase it?"

**ANDREAS**: "I choose. Three things per day. And I STAY. Physically and mentally. The Phantom can't hunt what refuses to run."

---

### Panel 51
*The Phantom swirls around them but can't touch them. As Marco commits to STAYING, the Phantom fades, frustrated, moving on to easier prey.*

**THE PHANTOM (fading)**: "Fine... there are others who will run..."

**CAPTION BOX**: "It looked for the next victim. Someone who hadn't learned. Someone still chasing. But it wouldn't be me. Not anymore."

---

## ACT 8: THE REVELATION

### Panel 52
*Sunset. Marco and Andreas on a rooftop overlooking the Microsoft campus. The rain has stopped. Orange and purple sky. Dramatic but peaceful.*

**CAPTION BOX**: "I'd seen all five assassins now. Interviewed their victims. Collected the evidence. And the truth was becoming clear."

---

### Panel 53
*Marco closes his detective notebook. Looks at the campus below - hundreds of attendees moving between buildings, unaware of the dangers.*

**MARCO**: "There is no Conference Crasher, is there? Not one external force."

**ANDREAS**: "No. There never was."

---

### Panel 54
*Close-up on Andreas's face, the sunset reflecting in his rectangular dark-framed glasses. His expression is wise, sad, hopeful all at once.*

**ANDREAS**: "The five assassins are real. But they're not supernatural villains. They're biological processes. Psychological tendencies. Scientific realities that most people never learn about until it's too late."

---

### Panel 55
*Andreas turns to fully face Marco, completely illuminated for the first time - no more shadows, no more mystery.*

**ANDREAS**: "Every victim invited their own destruction through IGNORANCE. Not malice. Not weakness. Just... not knowing."

**ANDREAS**: "The cure isn't strength or willpower. It's KNOWLEDGE. Understanding how your body and mind actually work. And making INTENTIONAL choices based on that understanding."

---

### Panel 56
*Marco looks at his notebook, now filled with "case files" on all five assassins. The evidence boards. The protocols.*

**MARCO**: "So the case is solved. The perpetrator is... us. Our own ignorance."

**ANDREAS**: "And the defense is awareness. Every protocol I showed you - they're not complicated. They're not expensive. They just require knowing they exist."

---

### Panel 57
*Marco stands, looking toward Building 33 with new determination. Tomorrow is Day 1 of the official summit. He has time.*

**MARCO**: "Then we need to tell the others. Before The Jitters gets them. Before The Night Thief steals their memories. Before any of them crash."

**ANDREAS**: "That's why I'm still here, Marco. Ten years of summits. Passing on what I learned."

---

### Panel 58
*The two stand silhouetted against the sunset, the campus spread out before them. No longer investigator and informant - now partners.*

**CAPTION BOX**: "The case of the Conference Crasher was closed. But the real work was just beginning. There would be more victims if we didn't act. And now... we knew how to save them."

---

## EPILOGUE: THE PREVENTION PROTOCOL

### Panel 59
*A bar in Bellevue, evening. Warm lighting, Pacific Northwest aesthetic. Marco and Andreas sit at a corner table with glasses of SPARKLING WATER with lime - no alcohol. A "case file" folder sits on the table between them.*

**CAPTION BOX**: "We toasted with sparkling water. It felt right."

**MARCO**: "So what do we do tomorrow? When the summit officially starts?"

---

### Panel 60
*Andreas opens the case file, revealing a clean summary: "THE PREVENTION PROTOCOL" - one page with all five defenses.*

**ANDREAS**: "We share what we know. Casually. In conversations. At sessions. During breaks. We become the counter-force."

**THE PREVENTION PROTOCOL** (visible on page):
1. "THE JITTERS: 90-min coffee delay, moderate dose, 6-hour cutoff"
2. "THE NIGHT THIEF: Max 2 drinks, stop 4 hours before bed"
3. "THE BRAIN DRAIN: Pre-decide trivial, save energy for important"
4. "THE VAMPIRE: Know your type, schedule recovery time"
5. "THE PHANTOM: Three priorities, full presence, JOMO"

---

### Panel 61
*Marco closes the file, tucks it into his jacket. Stands. His fedora is gone - he doesn't need the detective costume anymore. Just his completely bald head, his navy blazer, his sheep pin.*

**MARCO**: "Tomorrow at 6 AM. Building 33."

**ANDREAS**: "I'll bring the water bottles. You bring the protocols."

**MARCO**: "Deal."

---

### Panel 62
*Final panel. Wide establishing shot of Building 33 the next morning, sunrise over the campus. Two figures walk toward the entrance - one bald (Marco), one with glasses (Andreas). Other attendees stream in around them, unaware of the dangers ahead... but these two are ready.*

**CAPTION BOX - FINAL**: "The summit was about to begin. And somewhere in those buildings, five assassins waited for their next victims. But this time... someone would be waiting for THEM."

**BOTTOM TEXT**: "THE END"
