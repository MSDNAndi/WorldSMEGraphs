## The Five Core Planck Units

### Planck Length (ℓₚ)
**Formula**: ℓₚ = √(ℏG/c³)

**Formula**: tₚ = √(ℏG/c⁵) = ℓₚ/c  
**Value**: 5.391 × 10⁻⁴⁴ s  
**Meaning**: Shortest meaningful time interval  
**Analogy**: More Planck times in 1 second than seconds since the Big Bang

---

### Planck Mass (mₚ)
**Formula**: mₚ = √(ℏc/G)  
**Value**: 2.176 × 10⁻⁸ kg ≈ 22 micrograms  
**Meaning**: Mass where quantum effects = gravitational effects  
**Analogy**: Mass of a flea egg or grain of fine salt

---

### Planck Energy (Eₚ)
**Formula**: Eₚ = mₚc²  
**Value**: 1.956 × 10⁹ J ≈ 1.22 × 10¹⁹ GeV  
**Meaning**: Energy scale where all forces unify  
**Analogy**: Energy of a car at highway speed, compressed to atomic size

---

### Planck Temperature (Tₚ)
**Formula**: Tₚ = Eₚ/k_B  
**Value**: 1.417 × 10³² K  
**Meaning**: Highest meaningful temperature  
**Analogy**: 10²² times hotter than the sun's core

## Physical Significance

### Why Planck Scale Matters

1. **Quantum Gravity Regime**: Where QM and GR are equally important
2. **Measurement Limit**: Fundamental limit on spatial/temporal precision
3. **Force Unification**: Scale where all fundamental forces converge
4. **Early Universe**: Universe was Planck-sized at t = 0
5. **Black Hole Physics**: Smallest possible black holes are Planck-scale

### Key Physics at Planck Scale

- **Spacetime Structure**: May be discrete/granular ("quantum foam")
- **Causality**: Order of events becomes uncertain
- **Gravity**: Becomes as "strong" as other forces (α_G ≈ 1)
- **Current Theories**: Break down; need quantum gravity

## Important Relationships

### Compton Wavelength = Schwarzschild Radius
At Planck mass:
- λ_C = ℏ/(m_P c) = ℓ_P (quantum size)
- r_S = 2Gm_P/c² ≈ ℓ_P (gravitational size)

This defines where quantum mechanics meets gravity!

### Heisenberg Uncertainty at Planck Scale
- ΔE Δt ≥ ℏ/2
- At Δt = t_P: ΔE ~ E_P
- Energy fluctuations create significant spacetime curvature

### Black Hole Hawking Temperature
T_H = ℏc³/(8πGMk_B) = (m_P/M)(T_P/8π)

For M = m_P: T_H ~ T_P (Planck-mass black holes are Planck-hot!)

## Applications & Research Areas

### Cosmology
- **Planck Epoch** (0 < t < t_P): Quantum gravity era
- **Big Bang**: Universe started at T ~ T_P, ρ ~ ρ_P
- **Inflation**: Energy scales near (but below) E_P

### Black Hole Physics
- **Event Horizons**: Planck-scale structure unclear
- **Hawking Radiation**: Planck-mass BHs evaporate instantly
- **Information Paradox**: Requires Planck-scale understanding

### Quantum Gravity Theories
- **String Theory**: Strings vibrate at ℓ_P
- **Loop Quantum Gravity**: Space quantized in ℓ_P² units
- **Causal Sets**: Spacetime discrete at Planck scale

### Particle Physics
- **Grand Unification**: Forces merge near E_P
- **Supersymmetry**: May appear at scales below E_P
- **Extra Dimensions**: May be compactified at ~ℓ_P

## Common Misconceptions

❌ **"Planck length is the size of particles"**  
✅ Elementary particles are point-like down to much smaller scales

❌ **"Space is pixelated with Planck-sized pixels"**  
✅ Space may be discrete, but this is unproven

❌ **"Physics stops working below Planck scale"**  
✅ Our *current* theories become inadequate, not physics itself

❌ **"Planck time is the universe's frame rate"**  
✅ Time may be continuous; Planck time is a minimum meaningful interval

❌ **"We can never measure Planck scales"**  
✅ Direct measurement impossible, but indirect effects observable

## Experimental Status

### Current Limits
- **LHC**: Probes down to ~10⁻¹⁹ m
- **Gap to Planck**: 16 orders of magnitude
- **Required Energy**: 10¹⁵ times more than achievable

### Indirect Probes
- ✅ Gravitational wave observations (LIGO/Virgo)
- ✅ Cosmic microwave background (Planck satellite)
- ✅ Ultra-high-energy cosmic rays
- ✅ Black hole observations
- ❓ Quantum gravity phenomenology (ongoing research)

## Quick Formulas

### Dimensional Analysis
Any Planck unit can be expressed as:
**Planck_X = ℏᵃ Gᵇ cᶜ k_B^d**

where exponents (a,b,c,d) give correct dimensions for quantity X.

### Converting to SI
To convert from Planck units back to SI:
1. Multiply by appropriate powers of ℏ, G, c, k_B
2. Example: 1 Planck length = 1 × √(ℏG/c³) meters

### Natural Units (ℏ = G = c = 1)
In theoretical physics, often set Planck units to 1:
- Simplifies equations dramatically
- Dimensionful quantities measured relative to Planck scale
- Convert back at end using dimensional analysis
