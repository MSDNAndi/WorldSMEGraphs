Inside your body, you have special tubes called **blood vessels**! 

They're like tiny roads that help your blood travel everywhere.

**Imagine this:**
- Your blood vessels are like little highways 🛣️
- Blood travels on these highways all day long 🚗
- Every part of you needs blood to stay healthy!

- Take blood AWAY from your heart
- Like delivery trucks bringing good stuff!

**🔵 Blue Roads (Veins)**
- Carry dark blue blood
- Bring blood BACK to your heart  
- Like garbage trucks taking stuff away!

Blood is like a helper that brings:

- **Air** (oxygen) so you can breathe and play
- **Food** (energy) so you can run and jump
- **Warmth** so you don't get too cold

And it takes away:
- **Trash** (stuff your body doesn't need)
