### Your Body Has Amazing Roads! 🛤️

Inside you, there are special tubes called **blood vessels**.

They're like tiny highways that carry blood everywhere!

🔴 **Red roads** (arteries) take blood FROM your heart  
🔵 **Blue roads** (veins) bring blood BACK to your heart

Your heart pumps blood through all these roads - **thump-thump!** - all day long!

### Sometimes Roads Have Problems 🚧

Just like real roads, blood vessel roads can have problems:

**🚗 Blockages** - when something blocks the way (like toys in a hallway!)

**💧 Leaks** - when there's a small hole (like a garden hose with a leak!)

When this happens, a special doctor called a **Vascular Surgeon** can help fix them!
