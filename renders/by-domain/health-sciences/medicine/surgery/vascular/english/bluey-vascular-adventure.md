Bluey and Bingo were playing "Hospital" in the backyard when Mum called out, "Girls! We're going to visit Grandad at the hospital today!"

"Is Grandad okay?" asked Bluey, looking worried.

"He's going to be just fine," said Dad, giving her a reassuring hug. "A special doctor is helping his blood vessels work better."

"Dad, what's a blood vessel?" asked Bingo, tilting her head.

Dad knelt down to explain. "You know how we have roads and streets for cars? Well, your body has roads too! They're called blood vessels, and blood travels through them like tiny cars."

"Woooow!" said Bluey. "Roads inside us!"

"Your heart is like a really powerful engine," Dad continued. "It pumps blood through all these roads, delivering oxygen and food to every part of your body."

Bingo put her paw on her chest. "I can feel it! Thump-thump-thump!"

"That's your engine running," Dad smiled. "It never takes a break!"

"There are two types of roads," Mum explained in the car. "Red roads called arteries carry fresh blood FROM your heart. Blue roads called veins bring tired blood BACK to your heart."

Bluey nodded thoughtfully. "So it's like... delivery trucks going out and garbage trucks coming back?"

"Exactly right, Bluey!" said Mum.

When they arrived at the hospital, Bluey was amazed by how big it was. There were people in colorful scrubs walking around, and the air smelled like clean soap.

"This is where the special doctors work," said Dad. "They help people when their blood vessel roads need fixing."

![Page 7: Meeting Dr. Vena](./bluey-images/image_007_20260104_210238_91854732.png)

In Grandad's room, they met Dr. Vena, a kind vascular surgeon with warm eyes.

"Hello Heeler family! I'm Dr. Vena. I'm taking care of Grandad's blood vessels."

"Are you fixing his roads?" asked Bingo.

Dr. Vena laughed kindly. "That's a wonderful way to put it! Yes, one of Grandad's leg roads had a blockage, and we cleared it out."

Grandad held out his paws for hugs. "Come here, you two! I'm feeling so much better now."

"What happened to your road, Grandad?" Bluey asked.

"Well, over time, some stuff built up inside the road, making it hard for blood to get through to my leg. Dr. Vena used a special tiny tool to clear it all out!"

Dr. Vena showed them a colorful poster of the body's blood vessel system.

"Look at all these roads! Your body has about 60,000 miles of blood vessels—that's enough to wrap around the Earth more than twice!"

"That's HEAPS!" exclaimed Bluey.

"And your heart pumps blood through all of them, every single day," Dr. Vena added.

![Page 10: Playing the Blood Cell Game](./bluey-images/image_010_20260104_210239_82a692d7.png)

Back home, Bluey had an idea. "Let's play 'Blood Cells'!"

She set up a course in the living room. "I'm an oxygen truck! I carry oxygen FROM the heart to the toes!" She ran around the couch.

"I'm bringing carbon dioxide back!" yelled Bingo, running the other direction.

Mum and Dad watched, smiling at their daughters' imaginative play.

During the game, Bluey put cushions in the pathway. "Oh no! There's a blockage!"

"The traffic is backing up!" Bingo pretended to be stuck.

Dad joined in. "Time to call... Dr. Vena!" He pretended to move the cushions. "There! The road is clear again!"

"YAY!" the girls cheered as they resumed their running.

A few days later, Grandad came home from the hospital. He walked into the backyard where the girls were playing.

"Grandad! Your roads are working again!" Bluey hugged him tight.

"They sure are! And because of that, I can play with you two properly now."

Grandad kicked a ball across the grass. "Catch it, Bingo!"

That night at dinner, Mum served vegetables and fish.

"Eating healthy food helps keep your blood vessel roads clean and strong," she explained.

"Like... road maintenance!" said Bluey.

"Exactly," Mum nodded. "And exercise is like making sure the roads get used regularly, so they stay in good shape."

The next day, the whole family went to the park. They ran, jumped, played fetch, and had races.

"My heart is pumping SO FAST!" panted Bluey happily.

"That means your blood is zooming through all your roads," Dad said. "Your body loves this!"

Even Grandad joined in for a gentle walk. "Got to keep these new roads working!"

![Page 15: Bluey's Heart Song](./bluey-images/image_015_20260104_210340_010696a5.png)

That night, Bluey made up a song while getting ready for bed:

*"Thump-thump goes my heart,*  
*Pumping blood to every part!*  
*Red roads out, blue roads back,*  
*Keeping me on the right track!*  
*Eat my veggies, run and play,*  
*Healthy roads every day!"*

Bingo clapped. "That's a great song, Bluey!"

![Page 16: Dreaming of the Inside World](./bluey-images/image_016_20260104_210439_45875a80.png)

As Bluey fell asleep, she dreamed of shrinking down and traveling through the blood vessel highways. She zoomed through red arteries, watching oxygen molecules wave as they headed to the brain.

"This way to the toes!" a friendly blood cell pointed.

"For real life?" she wondered in her dream. "This is magical!"

A week later, Grandad had a follow-up appointment. The whole family went along.

"Your roads are looking excellent!" Dr. Vena told Grandad. "Keep up the healthy eating and walking."

Bluey tugged on Dr. Vena's coat. "Thank you for fixing Grandad's roads. You're like a superhero!"

Dr. Vena knelt down. "And YOU'RE a super granddaughter. Take care of those roads of yours!"

Walking to the car, Bluey held Grandad's paw.

"Grandad, I'm glad you're better. I never knew we had so many roads inside us."

"Neither did I, really, until I needed them fixed!" Grandad chuckled. "But now we both know how important they are."

"I'm going to take good care of mine," Bluey said seriously.

"That's my girl."

That evening, the whole Heeler family sat on the porch watching the sunset.

"You know what I learned today?" Bluey announced. "Our bodies are amazing. We have 60,000 miles of roads inside us, and our hearts never stop working."

"That IS amazing," said Mum, pulling Bluey close.

Dad nodded. "And we need to take care of all of it."

"Family hug!" yelled Bingo, and they all squeezed together.
