## Story Overview

Ms. Garcia, a 45-year-old teacher, has been suffering with aching, swollen legs and visible varicose veins. This case explores venous insufficiency from pathophysiology through minimally invasive treatment.

### Patient Case
- **Patient**: Ms. Garcia, 45 years old, teacher
- **Chief Complaint**: Aching legs by end of day, visible bulging veins
- **Occupational Factor**: Prolonged standing all day
- **Diagnosis**: CEAP Class C3 - varicose veins with edema, saphenous reflux
- **Treatment**: Endovenous laser ablation (EVLA) with compression therapy

---

## Learning Objectives

1. **Venous Anatomy and Physiology**
   - One-way valves prevent backward flow
   - When valves fail → blood pools → veins dilate
   - Greater and lesser saphenous system
   - Perforator vein connections

2. **CEAP Classification** (Clinical-Etiology-Anatomy-Pathophysiology)
   - **C0**: No visible venous disease
   - **C1**: Spider veins (telangiectasias)
   - **C2**: Varicose veins (>3mm dilated)
   - **C3**: Varicose veins with edema (Ms. Garcia)
   - **C4**: Skin changes (pigmentation, eczema)
   - **C5**: Healed venous ulcer
   - **C6**: Active venous ulcer

3. **Diagnostic Workup**
   - Duplex ultrasound for reflux assessment
   - Color flow shows direction (RED = backward flow)
   - Measure reflux duration (>0.5 sec abnormal)
   - Map incompetent perforators

4. **Treatment Algorithm**
   - **Conservative**: Compression stockings, leg elevation, exercise
   - **Minimally Invasive**: Endovenous ablation (laser or RF), sclerotherapy
   - **Surgical**: Phlebectomy, ligation, stripping (rarely needed now)

5. **Endovenous Laser Ablation (EVLA)**
   - Office-based procedure
   - Local tumescent anesthesia
   - Ultrasound-guided catheter placement
   - Laser heats and seals vein shut
   - Blood reroutes through healthy veins
   - Walk immediately after
   - Compression stockings for 2 weeks

## Clinical Pearls

### Risk Factors for Varicose Veins
- **Occupational**: Prolonged standing (teachers, nurses, retail workers)
- **Genetic**: Family history (50% if one parent affected)
- **Hormonal**: Pregnancy, oral contraceptives
- **Age**: Valve degeneration over time
- **Gender**: Women 2-3x more common than men
- **Weight**: Obesity increases venous pressure

### When to Treat
**Indications for intervention:**
- Symptomatic (pain, heaviness, fatigue)
- Skin changes (C4-C6)
- Bleeding from varicose veins
- Superficial thrombophlebitis
- Quality of life impact

**Conservative management if:**
- Asymptomatic
- Cosmetic concern only
- High surgical risk
- Patient preference

### EVLA Advantages
- Office-based (no OR needed)
- Local anesthesia
- Walk immediately
- Return to work in 1-2 days
- 95% success rate at 5 years
- Lower pain than surgery
- Minimal scarring

### Compression Therapy
- **Class I (20-30 mmHg)**: Mild varicose veins, prevention
- **Class II (30-40 mmHg)**: Moderate varicose veins (Ms. Garcia)
- **Class III (40-50 mmHg)**: Severe CVI, lymphedema
- Wear daily, put on before getting out of bed
- Replace every 3-6 months (lose elasticity)

## Prevention Tips

For people at risk:
- Avoid prolonged standing/sitting
- Elevate legs when resting
- Exercise regularly (calf muscle pump)
- Maintain healthy weight
- Wear compression stockings if high risk
- Don't cross legs when sitting
- Stay hydrated

## Myth vs Fact

**Myth**: Varicose veins are just a cosmetic problem.  
**Fact**: They can cause significant symptoms and lead to complications like ulcers.

**Myth**: Surgery is the only treatment.  
**Fact**: Modern treatments like EVLA are minimally invasive and office-based.

**Myth**: Crossing your legs causes varicose veins.  
**Fact**: It may worsen symptoms but doesn't cause the underlying valve failure.

**Myth**: Only old people get varicose veins.  
**Fact**: Can occur at any age, especially with family history or pregnancy.
