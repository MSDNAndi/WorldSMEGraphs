## Workflow Note

> **Important**: This comic was created using an **older workflow** where panels were defined in the Story Idea phase and narrative was written per-panel.
>
> **For new comics**, use the **story-first workflow** documented in:
> `.project/agents/image-generation/COMIC-STORY-WORKFLOW.md`
>
> **Correct workflow**:
> 1. Story Idea (NO panels yet)
> 2. Full Narrative (flowing prose, NO panel references)
> 3. Panel Planning (decide panels AFTER story is written)
> 4. Storyboard
> 5. Prompts
> 6. Images
