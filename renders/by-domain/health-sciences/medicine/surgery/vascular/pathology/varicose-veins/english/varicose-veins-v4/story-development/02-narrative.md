# Varicose Veins V4 - Full Narrative

## "Camila's Clinic Day"

Camila arrived at the vein clinic twenty minutes early, her long dark hair still slightly damp from her morning shower. She clutched her patient list like a talisman, reviewing the names and chief complaints one more time. Today was her first day running clinic alongside Dr. Young Erben, and she wanted everything to be perfect.

Dr. Erben looked up from the nursing station and smiled warmly. "Ready for your first vein clinic, Camila?"

"I think so," Camila said, though her racing heart suggested otherwise. "Eight patients scheduled. I've reviewed all their charts."

"That's what I like to hear. Remember, the vein clinic is different from the OR. Here, it's about connection—understanding the patient's lifestyle, their concerns, what they hope to achieve. Medicine is as much about listening as it is about treating."

The first patient was Mrs. Thompson, a 45-year-old high school teacher who had been on her feet for twenty years. She sat on the exam table, her legs showing prominent ropy blue veins snaking up her calves.

"They've been getting worse every year," Mrs. Thompson explained, self-consciously tugging at her skirt. "The aching is constant by the end of the school day. And frankly, I'm embarrassed to wear shorts anymore."

Camila performed a careful examination, noting the tortuous vessels, the mild ankle swelling, and the brownish discoloration around the ankles—a sign of chronic venous insufficiency. She used the handheld Doppler to listen to the blood flow, detecting the characteristic "whoosh" of reflux when she released compression on the calf.

"What causes these veins to become like this?" Mrs. Thompson asked.

Camila glanced at Dr. Erben, who nodded encouragingly. "Varicose veins happen when the valves inside your veins don't work properly," Camila explained, drawing a quick diagram on the exam room whiteboard. "Normally, these one-way valves keep blood flowing up toward your heart. When they fail, blood pools in the veins, stretching them out."

"But why me? My sister doesn't have them."

"Risk factors vary," Camila continued. "Standing for long periods—like teaching all day—is a major one. There's also a genetic component, age, being female, and having had children. Your occupation probably plays a significant role."

Dr. Erben stepped in. "The good news is we have many treatment options. For your situation, we'll start conservatively—compression stockings, elevation when possible, and regular walking to help your calf muscles pump blood back up."

After Mrs. Thompson left with her treatment plan and a follow-up appointment, the second patient arrived: Mr. Kowalski, a 55-year-old executive chef whose severe varicosities had progressed to open wounds on his ankle.

"I've been putting this off for years," he admitted, grimacing as Camila gently examined the ulcer. "Can't exactly take time off during restaurant season. But this wound won't heal."

Camila recognized the venous stasis ulcer—a complication of untreated chronic venous disease. The skin around the wound was thick and leathery, the classic lipodermatosclerosis of advanced disease.

"Mr. Kowalski, this ulcer is directly related to your vein problems," Dr. Erben explained. "The pressure from the malfunctioning veins damages the skin over time. To heal this wound, we need to address the underlying venous reflux."

"What does that involve?"

Dr. Erben pulled up the ultrasound images from Mr. Kowalski's previous visit. "We've identified significant reflux in your great saphenous vein. I'm recommending radiofrequency ablation—a minimally invasive procedure where we use heat to close the damaged vein. Blood then reroutes through healthy veins."

Camila watched as Dr. Erben walked the patient through the procedure, recovery expectations, and the likelihood of ulcer healing once the venous hypertension was addressed. She noted how the surgeon balanced clinical facts with genuine empathy.

Between patients, Dr. Erben turned to Camila. "What patterns are you noticing?"

Camila thought about the cases. "Occupation seems huge. Mrs. Thompson stands teaching all day. Mr. Kowalski stands cooking all day. Is there data on occupational risk?"

"Excellent observation. People who stand for more than four hours daily have significantly higher rates of varicose veins. Nurses, teachers, chefs, factory workers, retail employees—they're all at elevated risk."

The afternoon brought more variety: a young woman concerned about spider veins before her wedding, an elderly man with recurrent varicosities after previous surgery, and a pregnant woman seeking reassurance about new visible veins.

For each patient, Camila practiced her examination skills and communication, always with Dr. Erben's supportive presence. She learned to differentiate cosmetic concerns from medical necessity, to identify when conservative management was appropriate versus when intervention was needed.

The final patient of the day was a 50-year-old nurse from the cardiac ICU—a healthcare worker who had spent decades on her feet caring for others while neglecting her own vein health.

"Nurse heal thyself, right?" the woman joked ruefully, displaying legs crisscrossed with varicosities.

Camila felt a special connection to this patient. Healthcare workers were notorious for ignoring their own health issues. "How long have you been having symptoms?"

"Honestly? Years. The aching, the heaviness, the night cramps. I just thought it was normal for this job. But last month I noticed this swelling that wouldn't go away."

Together with Dr. Erben, Camila developed a comprehensive plan: compression stockings for daily wear, lifestyle modifications including leg elevation during breaks, and a scheduled procedure to address the incompetent great saphenous vein.

"The most important thing," Camila found herself saying, "is that you prioritize your health. You can't take care of patients if you're not taking care of yourself."

The nurse smiled. "You'll make a great doctor someday."

After the last patient left, Dr. Erben and Camila reviewed the day over coffee in the clinic break room. Diego and Camilo had joined them, curious to hear about Camila's experience.

"What was your biggest takeaway?" Dr. Erben asked.

"Prevention," Camila said without hesitation. "So much of what we saw today could have been prevented or at least slowed with earlier intervention. Compression stockings, regular movement, not ignoring symptoms for years."

"And your best moment?"

Camila smiled, thinking of the ICU nurse. "Convincing a healthcare worker to take care of herself. It felt... real. Like I was actually making a difference."

Dr. Erben nodded approvingly. "That's the heart of this work, Camila. The procedures are important, but the connection with patients—understanding their lives, their fears, their hopes—that's what makes it meaningful. You did well today. Very well."

As the team gathered their things to leave, Camila felt a warmth that had nothing to do with the summer evening outside. She had entered the clinic nervous about clinical skills and left realizing that the most important skill of all was one she already had: the ability to connect with people and help them help themselves.

That night, she called her mother in Madrid, describing the day's patients and lessons. Her mother, a teacher herself, listened with pride. "Mija, you're going to change lives. I always knew it."

Camila smiled into the phone, thinking of Mrs. Thompson and the years ahead of standing in her classroom. Tomorrow she would research educational materials about occupational health and vein disease. If she could help even one teacher, one nurse, one chef recognize the importance of vein health before it became a crisis, it would be worth it.

That was the kind of doctor she wanted to be.
