# Varicose Veins V3 - Story Idea

## UNIQUE NARRATIVE FOCUS: The Standing Profession

**Theme**: Occupational risk factors and the progression from cosmetic concern to medical necessity

**What makes this story different**:
- Focus on OCCUPATIONAL causes (nurse standing 12-hour shifts)
- Patient educating other patients in the end
- No cultural/language subplot
- Emphasis on CEAP classification and treatment options

## Character: Dr. Sarah Okonkwo

- **Ethnicity**: Nigerian-American
- **Age**: 45
- **Background**: Fellowship-trained venous specialist, research focus on chronic venous disease
- **Style**: Data-driven, uses diagrams, empowers patients with knowledge
- **Specialty**: Endovenous procedures, minimally invasive venous surgery

## Patient: Jennifer Walsh, RN

- **Age**: 38
- **Background**: ICU nurse for 15 years, single mother of two
- **Health History**: Mom had severe varicose veins leading to leg ulcers
- **Presentation**: Leg heaviness, visible veins, early skin changes (C3-C4)
- **Personality**: Healthcare-savvy but neglected own health for patients

## Story Hook

Jennifer, an experienced ICU nurse, has been ignoring her own leg symptoms for years because she's "too busy taking care of others." When she starts noticing skin changes and her legs hurt more than her patients' problems, she finally seeks help. Dr. Okonkwo shows her the scientific progression of venous disease - and that waiting could lead to her mother's fate.

## Educational Goals

### Clinical Focus
1. **Venous physiology** - One-way valves, calf muscle pump
2. **Risk factors** - Standing occupation, heredity, pregnancy
3. **CEAP classification** - Staging venous disease (C1-C6)
4. **Progression** - How untreated veins lead to complications
5. **Treatment options** - Compression, ablation, sclerotherapy
6. **Endovenous laser ablation** - Procedure walkthrough
7. **Prevention** - Lifestyle modifications, compression therapy
