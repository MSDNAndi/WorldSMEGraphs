# Varicose Veins V3 - Full Narrative

## The Standing Profession

Jennifer Walsh, RN, finished her eleventh hour in the ICU and her legs were screaming. She'd been on her feet since 6 AM—hanging IV drips, repositioning patients, running to code blues, charting at standing workstations. This was the job, and she loved it. But lately, her legs didn't love it back.

At the nursing station, she leaned against the counter, casually shifting weight from one foot to the other. The aching had become so constant that she barely noticed it anymore. It was just part of being a nurse.

"Jen, your legs look rough," said Karen, the charge nurse, as they crossed paths at the medication cart. "Those veins..."

Jennifer glanced down. Through her compression socks—the cheap ones from the drugstore—she could see the telltale bulging. Blue-purple ropes twisting under the skin, worse on the left than the right. Her mother's legs had looked like this once.

Her mother's legs had eventually ulcerated. The wound never fully healed.

"I know," Jennifer said. "I'll deal with it when things slow down."

Things never slowed down.

In the locker room after her shift, Jennifer peeled off her compression socks and studied her legs in the mirror. The varicose veins were unmistakable now—not just cosmetic spider veins but true varicosities, ropy and prominent. She noticed something else too: the skin around her ankle had a brownish discoloration, and it felt firm, almost woody to the touch.

Her mother's legs had started exactly this way.

Jennifer was thirty-eight years old. Her mother had been forty when the changes began, and by sixty she couldn't walk without bandages wrapped around weeping ulcers. Jennifer had sworn she would take care of herself, not let it get that far.

She'd broken that promise.

Dr. Sarah Okonkwo specialized in venous disease—a fellowship-trained expert who had spent years studying why veins failed and what could be done about it. Her office walls displayed anatomical diagrams and CEAP classification charts, tools for educating patients about their condition.

Jennifer sat on the exam table, legs dangling. The first thing Dr. Okonkwo did was ask: "What do you do for work?"

"ICU nurse. Fifteen years."

"How many hours on your feet?"

"Twelve minimum. Sometimes more."

Dr. Okonkwo nodded. "Let me show you something." She produced a small diagram of a leg vein. "Your veins have one-way valves that should only let blood flow upward, toward the heart. When you stand for hours, gravity works against those valves. Over time, they can fail."

She began examining Jennifer's legs with gloved hands, pressing, observing. She noted the bulging veins, the swelling around the ankles, the skin changes at the medial malleolus.

"This brownish discoloration—we call it hemosiderin staining. It's iron deposits from red blood cells that have leaked out of damaged veins. And this firmness in the tissue? That's lipodermatosclerosis. Early scarring."

Jennifer felt her stomach drop. "Those are the words they used about my mother."

"Tell me about your mother's legs."

"Venous ulcers. She had them for twenty years. Never fully healed. She wore bandages every day until she died."

Dr. Okonkwo pulled up the CEAP classification on her wall chart. "Let me explain where you are and where your mother was. CEAP is how we stage venous disease. C1 is spider veins—cosmetic. C2 is varicose veins. C3 is swelling. C4 is skin changes—like what you have. C5 is a healed ulcer. C6 is an active ulcer."

She pointed to the chart. "You're at C4. Your mother was at C6. You're not there yet, but you're on the same path. The question is whether we change that path."

The duplex ultrasound revealed what Dr. Okonkwo expected: incompetent valves in the great saphenous vein, with significant reflux. The blood that should have been climbing toward Jennifer's heart was falling backward with gravity, pooling in her leg, stretching the veins, damaging the skin.

"The good news is we can treat this," Dr. Okonkwo explained. "Twenty years ago, you would have needed vein stripping—general anesthesia, hospital stay, painful recovery. Now we can close the vein from the inside with a laser. You walk in, walk out, and go back to work in a few days."

"What about the veins that are already bulging?"

"Once we close the main source of reflux, the pressure drops and the branches often shrink. The ones that don't, we can treat with sclerotherapy—injections that close them off."

Jennifer had spent fifteen years helping patients make difficult decisions. Now she was the patient. "When can we do it?"

---

The procedure room looked more like a clinic than an operating room. Jennifer lay on a table, leg prepped with antiseptic, ultrasound machine ready. Dr. Okonkwo worked methodically, numbing the skin, accessing the vein through a tiny puncture.

"You'll feel some pressure as I position the laser fiber."

On the ultrasound screen, Jennifer could see the catheter advancing up her vein. It was surreal, watching her own anatomy in real-time.

"Now I'm going to inject tumescent anesthesia around the vein. This numbs the area and protects the surrounding tissue from the laser heat."

Multiple small injections, pressure more than pain. Jennifer watched the fluid surround her vein on the screen—a protective cushion.

"Activating the laser. You may feel some warmth."

A sensation of gentle heat spread through her leg as Dr. Okonkwo slowly withdrew the fiber, the laser energy sealing the vein closed behind it. The whole process took less than an hour.

Afterward, a compression stocking was applied, snug from toes to thigh.

"Wear this continuously for forty-eight hours, then during the day for two weeks. Walk as much as comfortable. You can return to work in three to five days."

One week later, Jennifer was back at work—this time with proper medical-grade compression stockings. Her legs felt different: lighter, less achy by the end of the shift. The difference was remarkable.

At the nursing station, she caught herself doing something new: educating patients about their legs. An elderly man with swollen ankles got a gentle lecture about elevation. A young nurse with spider veins got a recommendation to see a specialist before things progressed.

"You sound like a vein expert now," Karen teased.

"I sound like someone who almost became her mother."

At her three-month follow-up, Dr. Okonkwo performed another ultrasound. The treated vein was closed and scarring down. The skin changes at the ankle had stabilized—not reversed, but no longer progressing.

"This is what prevention looks like," Dr. Okonkwo said. "You caught it at C4. With good compression and lifestyle changes, you should never reach C6."

Jennifer thought about all the nurses she knew who stood for twelve hours a day, who ignored their aching legs because they were too busy caring for others. She'd been one of them.

"Can I ask a favor?" she said.

"Of course."

"I want to put up some education materials in our break room. About venous disease, about standing professions, about not waiting until it's too late. Do you have anything I can use?"

Dr. Okonkwo smiled. "I have exactly what you need."

---

Six months later, Jennifer led a "Leg Health for Nurses" seminar in the hospital auditorium. Fifty healthcare workers attended—nurses, techs, pharmacists, anyone who spent shifts on their feet.

She showed them her before photos—the bulging veins, the skin changes, the path she'd been on. She showed them her after photos—stable, treated, managed.

"Don't wait until you have your mother's legs," she told them. "Don't wait until you need to be a patient. We spend our lives taking care of others. We have to take care of ourselves too."

In the front row, a young nurse rolled up her scrub pants leg, looking at the spider veins she'd been ignoring.

After the talk, she made an appointment.
