# Varicose Veins V5 - Narrative

## Camila's Clinic Day

The vein clinic waiting room was filled with patients when Camila arrived for her morning rotation. She smoothed her long dark wavy hair and checked her badge nervously—today was her first day running patient consultations alongside Dr. Young Erben.

"Ready for clinic day?" Dr. Erben asked, appearing beside her with a warm smile. Despite her petite stature, the Korean physician radiated confidence and calm.

"I think so," Camila replied, her Ecuadorian accent slightly more pronounced when she was nervous. "I've been reading about venous insufficiency all week."

"Good. But today you'll learn something books can't teach—how to listen to patients and understand their stories. Varicose veins aren't just a medical condition; they're often tied to people's lives and livelihoods."

Their first patient was Maria, a 45-year-old hotel housekeeper who had been standing for her job for twenty years. She pointed to the prominent blue-purple veins snaking down her legs.

"They've been getting worse for years," Maria explained. "My legs ache terribly by the end of my shift."

Dr. Erben guided Camila through the examination. "What do you notice about the vein distribution?"

Camila observed carefully. "They follow the great saphenous vein distribution. And there's some ankle swelling."

"Excellent. Now, Maria, tell me about a typical workday."

Maria described eight-hour shifts on her feet, pushing heavy carts, with minimal breaks. Dr. Erben nodded knowingly.

"Prolonged standing is one of the biggest risk factors for varicose veins," she explained to both Camila and Maria. "When you stand, gravity works against the blood trying to return to your heart. Over time, the valves in the veins can fail."

Using a simple diagram, Dr. Erben showed how healthy valves prevent blood from flowing backward, and how damaged valves allow blood to pool in the legs.

"The pooling blood increases pressure, and the veins stretch and become tortuous—that's what we see as varicose veins."

Maria looked worried. "Do I need surgery?"

Dr. Erben smiled reassuringly. "Not necessarily. Let's talk about conservative management first. Compression stockings, leg elevation during breaks, and exercises can make a significant difference."

Camila watched as Dr. Erben fitted Maria with compression stockings and demonstrated exercises. The patient's relief was palpable.

Their next patient presented a different challenge. Teresa, a 35-year-old marketing executive, pointed to spider veins on her thighs.

"I hate how they look," Teresa said. "I can't wear shorts anymore."

After examination, Dr. Erben turned to Camila. "What's the difference between spider veins and varicose veins?"

"Spider veins are smaller, superficial vessels that are mostly a cosmetic concern," Camila answered. "Varicose veins are larger and can cause symptoms."

"Correct. Teresa, your spider veins are purely cosmetic—they won't cause medical problems. We can treat them with sclerotherapy if the appearance bothers you, but it's not medically necessary."

Teresa seemed relieved to learn she had options but no urgent medical need.

The afternoon brought Mr. Rodriguez, a 58-year-old truck driver with severe varicose veins and skin changes around his ankle—brown discoloration and early ulceration.

Dr. Erben's expression grew serious. "This is different. Camila, what are we seeing here?"

"Chronic venous insufficiency with lipodermatosclerosis and early venous ulceration," Camila said, remembering her reading.

"Exactly. This is beyond conservative management. Mr. Rodriguez needs intervention to prevent progression to full venous ulcer."

She explained the options: endovenous laser ablation, radiofrequency ablation, or surgical stripping. Mr. Rodriguez opted for the less invasive laser treatment.

As the clinic day ended, Camila and Dr. Erben debriefed in the office.

"What did you learn today?" Dr. Erben asked.

Camila thought carefully. "That varicose veins exist on a spectrum—from cosmetic concerns to serious medical problems. And that understanding a patient's occupation and lifestyle is crucial for both diagnosis and treatment planning."

Dr. Erben nodded approvingly. "You connected with the patients today, Camila. That empathy will serve you well. Medicine is about more than diagnosing and treating—it's about understanding people."

Camila smiled, feeling a sense of accomplishment. The clinic had been busy and challenging, but she had learned more in one day than weeks of textbook study could provide.

"Same time next week?" she asked hopefully.

Dr. Erben laughed. "Absolutely. You're a natural at this."
