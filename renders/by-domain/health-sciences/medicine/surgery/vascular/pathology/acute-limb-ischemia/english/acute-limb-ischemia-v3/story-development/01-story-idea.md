# Acute Limb Ischemia V3 - Story Idea

## UNIQUE NARRATIVE FOCUS: The Racing Heart

**Theme**: Atrial fibrillation causing arterial embolism - a race against the clock

**What makes this story different**: 
- Focus on the MECHANISM (heart throwing clots)
- Patient is an athletic coach who notices symptoms during practice
- No language barriers - clear medical communication focus
- Emphasis on the "golden 6 hours" countdown

## Character: Dr. Marcus Chen

- **Ethnicity**: Chinese-American
- **Age**: 52
- **Background**: Former military surgeon, now academic vascular specialist
- **Style**: Calm under pressure, uses sports analogies to explain
- **Specialty**: Acute limb salvage, thromboembolectomy

## Patient: Coach Robert "Bobby" Williams

- **Age**: 64
- **Background**: High school football coach, 35 years
- **Health History**: Known atrial fibrillation, stopped warfarin due to bruising
- **Presentation**: Sudden leg pain during morning practice, can't walk off field
- **Personality**: Tough, minimizes pain, needs convincing this is serious

## Story Hook

During Friday morning football practice, Coach Williams suddenly can't feel his left leg. His players call 911. Dr. Chen must convince this stubborn, pain-minimizing coach that his leg is dying - and that his decision to stop blood thinners may cost him the leg.

## Educational Goals

### Clinical Focus
1. **Atrial fibrillation as clot source** - Heart rhythm causing embolism
2. **Importance of anticoagulation compliance** - Why patients stop, why they shouldn't
3. **6 Ps assessment** - Systematic evaluation
4. **Time is tissue** - The 6-hour window
5. **Fogarty catheter embolectomy** - Procedure details
6. **Post-op anticoagulation** - Preventing recurrence
