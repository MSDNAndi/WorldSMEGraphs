# Acute Limb Ischemia V4 - Full Narrative

## "Diego's First Emergency"

The fluorescent lights of the vascular surgery call room hummed softly as Diego adjusted his glasses for the tenth time that hour. It was 2 AM, and this was his first overnight call as a research intern under Dr. Young Erben. So far, the night had been quiet—just paperwork and reading—but Diego couldn't shake the nervous energy coursing through him.

Dr. Young Erben looked up from her laptop, her warm brown eyes catching Diego's fidgeting. "First overnight jitters?" she asked with a knowing smile.

"That obvious?" Diego admitted, managing a sheepish grin.

"It gets easier," Dr. Erben assured him. "The key is staying calm and thinking systematically. Medicine isn't about knowing everything—it's about knowing how to approach problems."

Before Diego could respond, his pager buzzed. Dr. Erben's went off simultaneously. They exchanged glances as she read the message aloud: "ER consult. 62-year-old male, sudden severe right leg pain, two hours duration."

"Time to learn," Dr. Erben said, already moving toward the door. "Come on, Diego. This is exactly why we're here."

They walked briskly through the quiet hospital corridors, Dr. Erben's practical flats clicking against the linoleum. "What's running through your head right now?" she asked.

Diego thought quickly. "Sudden leg pain in an older patient... could be a lot of things. Muscle cramp? DVT? Something vascular?"

"Good start. What makes sudden severe pain particularly concerning in our field?"

"Arterial problems?" Diego ventured. "If blood can't get to the leg..."

"Exactly. Acute limb ischemia. Remember this night, Diego, because what happens in the next few hours could determine whether this man keeps his leg."

They pushed through the ER doors to find an anxious-looking man on a stretcher, his face pale and drawn with pain. His daughter stood beside him, gripping his hand.

"Mr. Rodriguez, I'm Dr. Young Erben from vascular surgery, and this is Diego, one of my research interns. Can you tell me what happened?"

"I was watching TV, everything normal," Mr. Rodriguez said through gritted teeth. "Then suddenly—like someone stabbed my leg. The pain just hit me out of nowhere. And now it feels... cold. Wrong."

Dr. Erben nodded, her expression calm but focused. "Diego, I want you to examine Mr. Rodriguez's legs. Compare the right to the left. Tell me what you observe."

Diego approached carefully, his nervousness transforming into concentration. He looked at both legs, noting the stark difference. The right leg was noticeably paler than the left—almost waxy in appearance.

"The right leg looks pale," Diego reported. "Much lighter than the left."

"Good. That's Pallor—the first of the six Ps we look for in acute limb ischemia. What else?"

Diego gently touched both legs. The right felt cool, almost cold, while the left was warm. "It's cold compared to the other leg."

"Poikilothermia—the leg can't regulate its temperature because there's no warm blood flowing through. Now, feel for pulses."

Diego moved to the feet, pressing his fingers to the usual pulse points. On the left, he felt the reassuring thump of the dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial arteries. On the right—nothing.

"I can't find pulses on the right side," Diego said, his voice tightening with concern.

"Pulselessness. That's three of the six Ps. Mr. Rodriguez, can you wiggle your toes for me?"

The patient tried. His left toes moved easily. The right barely twitched.

"The movement is very weak," Diego observed.

"Paralysis is setting in," Dr. Erben explained quietly to Diego. "And Mr. Rodriguez, how does your right leg feel? Any numbness or tingling?"

"It felt tingly at first, now parts of it are numb," the patient admitted, fear creeping into his voice.

"That's Paresthesia. And the Pain you came in with makes six. Diego, you just witnessed the Six Ps of acute arterial occlusion: Pain, Pallor, Pulselessness, Paresthesia, Paralysis, and Poikilothermia."

Diego committed the list to memory, understanding now why each sign mattered. This wasn't abstract textbook knowledge—this was a man's leg, a man's life.

"What happens now?" Mr. Rodriguez's daughter asked, her voice trembling.

Dr. Erben turned to her with compassion. "We need to act quickly. In acute limb ischemia, we say 'time is muscle'—the longer the leg goes without blood flow, the more tissue dies. We're going to get some imaging to see exactly where the blockage is, and then we'll likely need to take your father to the operating room."

She turned to the ER team. "I need a STAT CTA of the abdomen, pelvis, and lower extremities. Start a heparin drip—we need to prevent the clot from extending. Let the OR know we may have an emergent embolectomy."

As the team mobilized, Dr. Erben pulled Diego aside. "What do you think caused this sudden blockage?"

Diego thought back to his reading. "Could be an embolus—a clot from somewhere else, maybe the heart. Or it could be thrombosis on top of existing atherosclerosis."

"Excellent. Given the sudden onset and his history of atrial fibrillation—did you catch that in his chart?—an embolus is most likely. A piece of clot from his heart traveled down and lodged in his femoral artery."

The CT angiogram confirmed their suspicion: a complete occlusion of the right superficial femoral artery. Within the hour, Mr. Rodriguez was in the operating room. Dr. Erben let Diego observe as she performed an embolectomy, using a balloon catheter to extract the clot.

"Watch the leg," she said as blood flow was restored.

Diego observed in amazement as color began to return to the pale limb. The waxy appearance faded, replaced by healthy pink tissue. It was like watching life return to something that had been dying.

Post-operatively, Mr. Rodriguez was moved to the recovery unit, his leg saved. His daughter was tearfully grateful, hugging the nurses and thanking Dr. Erben profusely.

Back in the call room, as the first light of dawn crept through the windows, Dr. Erben poured two cups of coffee and handed one to Diego.

"How do you feel?" she asked.

Diego took a moment to find the words. "I feel like I understand now. Reading about conditions is one thing, but seeing it—seeing how quickly things can change, how important every minute is..."

"That's what emergency medicine teaches us. The Six Ps aren't just a checklist to memorize. They're warning signs that tell us someone's limb—and potentially their life—is in danger."

"Will I always feel this scared?" Diego asked honestly.

Dr. Erben smiled warmly. "The fear never completely goes away—and that's a good thing. It keeps you sharp, keeps you humble. What changes is your confidence in knowing what to do with that fear. Tonight, you did exactly what you were supposed to do: you observed carefully, you asked questions, and you learned. I'm proud of you, Diego."

Diego felt a warmth spread through his chest that had nothing to do with the coffee. He had started the night terrified of making mistakes. He was ending it knowing that the nervousness would always be there, but so would his ability to work through it.

"Same time tonight?" he asked.

Dr. Erben laughed. "That's the spirit. But first—get some sleep. Tomorrow, we'll review the case with Camila and Camilo. Teaching others what you learned is the best way to cement it in your memory."

Diego headed to the break room, his mind still replaying the night's events. The Six Ps echoed in his thoughts: Pain, Pallor, Pulselessness, Paresthesia, Paralysis, Poikilothermia. He would never forget them now. They weren't just words—they were the difference between a saved limb and a lost one, between a patient going home to his family and facing a devastating outcome.

And that, Diego realized, was what medicine was all about.
