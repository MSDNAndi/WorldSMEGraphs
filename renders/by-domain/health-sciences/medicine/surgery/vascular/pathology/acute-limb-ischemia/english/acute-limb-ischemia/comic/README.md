## Story Overview

A 3 AM emergency call brings the team face-to-face with Ms. Taylor, a 55-year-old woman with sudden onset "dead leg." This time-critical case teaches the 6 Ps of acute ischemia and the urgency of limb-saving intervention.

### Patient Case
- **Patient**: Ms. Taylor, 55 years old
- **Chief Complaint**: Sudden cold, numb, painful left leg (3 hours duration)
- **Diagnosis**: Acute limb ischemia - embolic from atrial fibrillation
- **Time Window**: 6 hours to restore perfusion or risk amputation
- **Treatment**: Fogarty balloon thromboembolectomy

## Learning Objectives

1. **The 6 Ps of Acute Limb Ischemia**
   - Pain
   - Pallor (pale, white leg)
   - Pulselessness (no pulses)
   - Paresthesia (numbness)
   - Paralysis (can't move)
   - Poikilothermia (cold to touch)

2. **Rutherford Classification**
   - Class I: Viable (no immediate threat)
   - Class IIa: Marginally threatened (salvageable if treated promptly)
   - Class IIb: Immediately threatened (salvageable with immediate intervention)
   - Class III: Irreversible (amputation likely)

3. **Etiology**
   - Embolic causes: Atrial fibrillation, cardiac thrombus
   - Thrombotic causes: Atherosclerotic disease
   - ECG interpretation for atrial fibrillation

4. **Emergency Management**
   - Immediate anticoagulation (heparin bolus + drip)
   - Time-critical nature (6-hour window)
   - Urgent surgical consultation
   - Fogarty balloon embolectomy technique

5. **Procedural Details**
   - Regional anesthesia with sedation
   - Fogarty balloon catheter design and function
   - Arteriotomy technique
   - Clot extraction
   - Post-operative Doppler assessment
   - Compartment syndrome monitoring

## Clinical Pearls

### The 6-Hour Window
Acute limb ischemia is a true emergency. After 6 hours of ischemia:
- Muscle damage becomes irreversible
- Myoglobin release → rhabdomyolysis
- Metabolic acidosis → reperfusion injury
- Compartment syndrome risk increases
- Amputation becomes more likely

### Atrial Fibrillation Connection
- Most common source of arterial emboli
- Left atrial appendage clot formation
- Irregular ECG rhythm without P waves
- Requires long-term anticoagulation

### Fogarty Technique
- Balloon catheter inserted beyond clot
- Balloon inflated, pulled back to extract clot
- Multiple passes until good flow restored
- Check pulses with Doppler immediately
- Monitor for compartment syndrome post-op
