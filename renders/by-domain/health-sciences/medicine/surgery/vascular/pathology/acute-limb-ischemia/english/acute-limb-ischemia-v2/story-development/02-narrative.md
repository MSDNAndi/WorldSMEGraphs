# Acute Limb Ischemia V2 - Full Narrative (35 Panels)

## Act 1: Emergency Recognition (Panels 1-10)

### Panel 1: The 3 AM Call
The phone's shrill ring pierced the darkness of Dr. Young Erben's bedroom. She reached for her glasses on the nightstand, her eyes focusing on the clock: 3:02 AM. "Dr. Erben," she answered in English, her voice alert despite the hour. It was the ER resident, voice tense: "We need you now. 68-year-old male, left leg - it's dead, ma'am. No pulses, can't move his toes." Dr. Erben was already sitting up. "I'm coming. Start heparin - 80 units per kilo bolus. I'll be there in 15 minutes."

### Panel 2: Racing to the Hospital
Dr. Erben's car cut through the empty pre-dawn streets. The dashboard clock glowed 3:11 AM. Her mind raced through the differential: Embolus versus thrombosis? Probably embolus at this age if he has AFib. She'd seen this before - a clot from the heart traveling down to lodge in the leg arteries. Time was everything now. Every minute without blood flow meant more tissue damage, more risk of amputation. She pressed the accelerator, the hospital's lights appearing ahead.

### Panel 3: ER Arrival - First Look
Dr. Erben pushed through the ER doors at 3:17 AM, her petite frame moving with purpose. Carlos Ramirez lay on the stretcher, his face contorted in pain, his left leg visibly paler than the right. His wife clutched his hand, tears streaming down her face. The ER resident gestured to the leg: "He's been like this for about 4 hours. Says it started suddenly, watching TV at home." Dr. Erben's eyes narrowed - four hours. Still within the golden window, but they had to move fast.

### Panel 4: Speaking in Spanish - Building Trust
Dr. Erben approached Carlos, and when she spoke, it was in fluent Spanish with a slight Venezuelan lilt: "Señor Ramirez, soy la Dra. Erben. Voy a examinar su pierna ahora." ("Mr. Ramirez, I'm Dr. Erben. I'm going to examine your leg now.") Carlos's eyes widened with relief. "¡Doctora! ¿Habla español? Mi pierna está muerta... ¿la voy a perder?" ("Doctor! You speak Spanish? My leg is dead... will I lose it?") Dr. Erben placed a gentle hand on his shoulder: "Vamos a hacer todo lo posible para salvarla. But I need to examine you quickly." ("We're going to do everything possible to save it.")

### Panel 5: The 6 Ps Assessment
Dr. Erben's examination was systematic and swift. "Pain - yes, severe," she noted. The leg was Pale - ghostly white compared to the right. She felt for pulses - Pulselessness, complete absence. Light touch test - Paresthesias, Carlos couldn't feel her finger. "Try to move your toes" - Paralysis, no movement at all. She touched the skin - Poikilothermia, ice cold. All six Ps present. This was complete acute ischemia. "Four out of six is bad," she thought, "but six out of six... we're racing against permanent damage."

### Panel 6: Doppler Ultrasound - Confirming the Worst
Dr. Erben pressed the Doppler ultrasound probe to Carlos's ankle, listening through the speaker. Silence. She moved to the dorsalis pedis artery location. More silence. Behind the medial malleolus for the posterior tibial artery. Still nothing. She increased the volume - only ambient noise. "No arterial signals," she announced to the team. "This is complete occlusion." She moved the probe to his groin - there, the common femoral artery pulsed normally. The blockage was somewhere in between.

### Panel 7: EKG Shows Atrial Fibrillation
"Has anyone checked his heart rhythm?" Dr. Erben asked. The nurse handed her the EKG strip. Dr. Erben's eyes scanned the irregularly irregular rhythm, no P waves, classic atrial fibrillation. "There's our culprit," she said, holding up the strip. "Señor Ramirez, ¿tiene fibrilación atrial? ¿Toma anticoagulantes?" ("Do you have atrial fibrillation? Do you take blood thinners?") Carlos shook his head: "Mi cardiólogo dijo que la tenía, pero no me dio medicina para eso." ("My cardiologist said I had it, but didn't give me medicine for it.") Dr. Erben's jaw tightened. A preventable disaster.

### Panel 8: Wife's Arrival - Fear of Amputation
"¡Mi amor!" Carlos's wife, Maria, burst into the exam room, her face etched with terror. "Doctor, por favor, ¿van a cortar su pierna?" ("Doctor, please, are you going to cut off his leg?") Dr. Erben turned to face her, speaking gently in Spanish: "Señora, entiendo su miedo. La situación es seria, pero llegamos a tiempo. Vamos a hacer una cirugía para sacar el coágulo." ("Ma'am, I understand your fear. The situation is serious, but we arrived in time. We're going to do surgery to remove the clot.") Maria grabbed Dr. Erben's hands: "¿Está segura? ¿Segura que no hay que amputar?" ("Are you sure? Sure that you don't have to amputate?")

### Panel 9: The Race Against Time Explained
Dr. Erben pulled up a chair, eye-level with Carlos and Maria. "Escuchen, tienen que entender something," she said, switching between Spanish and English naturally. "Right now, his leg has no blood flow. We have maybe 2-3 hours left before the damage becomes permanent. The surgery is called an embolectomy - we go in through his groin, insert a special catheter, and pull out the clot." She drew a quick sketch on a piece of paper. "But we must move NOW. No delays, no waiting. Do you understand?" Both nodded vigorously, clutching each other's hands.

### Panel 10: Informed Consent - Multilingual Medicine
"Carlos, necesito tu consentimiento for surgery," Dr. Erben continued, her expressive glasses catching the overhead lights as she leaned forward. "The risks include: bleeding, infection, need for repeat surgery, and yes - despite our best efforts - possible amputation if the damage is too severe. But if we do nothing, you will definitely lose the leg. And the clot came from your heart - we need to prevent this from happening again." She switched to English for the medical details, then back to Spanish for emotional reassurance: "Confía en mí. I've done this many times. We can save your leg." Carlos signed the consent form with a trembling hand: "Haga lo que tenga que hacer, doctora." ("Do what you have to do, doctor.")

## Act 2: Surgical Preparation (Panels 11-18)

### Panel 11: Team Mobilization
Dr. Erben stepped out of the ER, pulling out her phone. 3:42 AM. She rapid-fired calls to her team: "This is Dr. Erben. I need an emergency OR - acute limb ischemia, embolectomy. Call in the on-call scrub tech and circulator. Have them pull the Fogarty catheter set - I'll need 3, 4, and 5 French. Anesthesia, I need someone who can do a spinal fast. We're rolling in 15 minutes." Across the city, phones rang, waking sleeping staff members. The hospital's emergency machinery hummed to life.

### Panel 12: Pre-op Preparation - Heparin Bolus
Back in the ER, the nurse was hanging the heparin drip. "5000 units given as bolus," she reported. Dr. Erben nodded, checking the dose calculation in her head - Carlos weighed about 70 kilos, so 5600 units would be right, close enough. The heparin would prevent new clot formation and stop the existing clot from extending further. "Keep it running at 1000 units per hour," she instructed. Carlos watched the clear fluid dripping into his IV: "¿Esto va a arreglar mi pierna?" ("Will this fix my leg?") "No," Dr. Erben answered honestly, "but it will keep it from getting worse while we prepare to fix it surgically."

### Panel 13: Surgical Consent - The Diagram
Dr. Erben pulled out a blank piece of paper and began drawing. Her sketch showed a simple stick figure with the leg highlighted. "Mira, Carlos," she said, pointing with her pen. "Your heart - el corazón - has an irregular rhythm. A clot formed here," she marked an X over the heart, "and traveled down through your arteries," she drew an arrow down the leg, "until it got stuck here," another X at mid-thigh. "I'm going to make a small cut here," she marked the groin, "put in this special balloon catheter," she drew a thin line with a circle, "and pull out the clot." Maria studied the diagram: "¿Y después?" ("And after?") "After, we fix the heart problem so it doesn't happen again."

### Panel 14: Carlos's Fear
Carlos's voice cracked as he asked in Spanish: "Doctora, when this is over... ¿podré caminar otra vez? I'm a gardener. My work, my life... it's all walking, kneeling, working with my hands in the earth." Dr. Erben saw the fear behind his eyes - not just fear of death, but fear of losing his livelihood, his identity. She squeezed his hand: "Carlos, if we move quickly, if the surgery goes well, yes - you will walk again. You will work in your gardens again. But I need you to trust me and let me work fast. ¿Entiendes?" ("Do you understand?") He nodded, wiping away tears.

### Panel 15: Dr. Erben's Reassurance
Dr. Erben spoke quietly but firmly, her Venezuelan Spanish carrying the weight of experience: "Señor Ramirez, he hecho esta cirugía many times. I know it's scary. I know you're thinking about your family, your work. But right now, I need you to focus on one thing: you are in good hands. Your leg will have blood flow again in less than an hour. Then we heal, then we prevent it from happening again. One step at a time. ¿Estás listo?" ("I've done this surgery many times... Are you ready?") Carlos took a deep breath, his wife holding one hand, Dr. Erben holding the other: "Estoy listo, doctora." ("I'm ready, doctor.")

### Panel 16: OR Team Assembling
In the operating room, the team gathered. The scrub tech laid out the Fogarty catheter set on the sterile field - the specialized catheters with their inflatable balloons glinting under the surgical lights. The circulating nurse checked the emergency cart: "Vascular clamps, check. Potts scissors, check. 6-0 prolene suture, check." The anesthesiologist prepared his spinal kit. Dr. Erben arrived, still in her street clothes, reviewing the setup: "Good. I'll need a DeBakey forceps too. And have patch material ready - if the artery looks damaged, I may need to patch it." At 4:05 AM, they were ready.

### Panel 17: Anesthesia Induction
Carlos was transferred to the OR table, Maria's kiss still warm on his forehead. The anesthesiologist, Dr. Kim, positioned Carlos on his side for the spinal. "Small pinch, Carlos," he said through the interpreter headset. The spinal needle slid between the vertebrae, clear cerebrospinal fluid confirming placement. "Medicación going in now." Within minutes, Carlos's legs were numb. Dr. Kim laid him flat, placed a nasal cannula for oxygen, and administered light sedation. "He can hear us but won't remember," Dr. Kim told Dr. Erben. "Blood pressure is stable. He's ready when you are."

### Panel 18: Surgical Prep and Draping
The surgical tech scrubbed Carlos's left groin and leg with betadine, the orange-brown solution painting his skin. Dr. Erben scrubbed at the sink, her small hands moving methodically through the ritual - nails, fingers, palms, wrists, forearms. She gowned and gloved, then approached the table. The team draped Carlos in blue sterile sheets, leaving only a small window of skin exposed over his left groin. Dr. Erben positioned the overhead lights, tested them, then looked around the room: "Everyone ready? Time out: Carlos Ramirez, 68 years old, acute left lower extremity ischemia, Fogarty embolectomy. Antibiotic given. Consent signed. Let's save this leg."

## Act 3: Surgical Procedure (Panels 19-28)

### Panel 19: Groin Incision
Dr. Erben held the scalpel over the marked incision site. "Knife," she said, her voice calm and focused. The blade pressed through skin, the incision straight and deliberate, about 10 centimeters long running parallel to the inguinal ligament. Blood welled up. "Bovie," she called for the cautery. Tiny wisps of smoke rose as she meticulously cauterized each bleeding vessel, maintaining a bloodless field. The yellow subcutaneous fat parted, revealing the deeper fascia beneath. She was in her element now - every movement precise, efficient, wasting no time but taking no shortcuts.

### Panel 20: Exposing the Femoral Artery
Layer by layer, Dr. Erben dissected down. "Self-retaining retractor," she requested, and the Weitlaner spreader was placed, opening the wound wider. There - the femoral artery appeared, pulsating strongly under her fingertips. "Good proximal flow," she noted aloud. She carefully freed the artery from the surrounding tissue, isolating it. "Vessel loops," she said, and the tech handed her thin silicone loops which she passed behind the artery - proximal control first, then distal. The common femoral, superficial femoral, and deep femoral arteries were now all isolated, ready for control.

### Panel 21: Arteriotomy - The Clot Visible
"Satinsky clamp above, two bulldogs below," Dr. Erben instructed, and the team clamped the vessels. Flow stopped - she now had full control. With a fine blade, she made a small longitudinal arteriotomy, cutting into the vessel wall. Dark blood oozed out, and there - she could see it - the dark red clot protruding into the lumen. "There's our culprit," she said. "Look at the size of that embolus. No wonder he had no flow." The clot was clearly fresh, not organized or adherent - good news. This should come out easily.

### Panel 22: Fogarty Catheter Insertion
Dr. Erben picked up the 4-French Fogarty catheter, checking the balloon by inflating it with a saline-filled syringe. The tiny balloon inflated perfectly, then deflated. "Here we go," she said, feeding the catheter into the arteriotomy, advancing it distally down the superficial femoral artery. The catheter slid smoothly - 10 centimeters, 20, 30, until she felt resistance. "That's as far as it goes," she said. "Now for the fun part." She pulled the catheter back slightly, then inflated the balloon with 0.5 mL of saline. "Balloon is up. Starting extraction."

### Panel 23: Balloon Inflation Explained
The scrub tech, new to vascular surgery, leaned in to watch. Dr. Erben explained as she worked: "See how the balloon inflates inside the artery? It creates a seal against the vessel wall. As I pull it back toward me, it drags the clot along with it. Like a tiny plunger cleaning out a pipe." She demonstrated the slow, steady withdrawal. "You have to be gentle - too much force and you can damage the vessel wall. Too little and you don't capture the clot." Her hands moved with practiced precision, feeling the subtle resistance of the clot through the catheter.

### Panel 24: First Pass Extraction
Dr. Erben pulled the catheter steadily toward the arteriotomy. "Here it comes," she said. And then - SPLOP - a large, dark red clot extruded from the arteriotomy, landing in the basin. The team gasped. It was massive - easily 8 centimeters long, shaped like a cast of the artery itself. "That," Dr. Erben said with satisfaction, "is what was blocking his leg. No wonder he couldn't feel anything." But she wasn't done. "We're not out of the woods yet. There could be more distally. Second pass."

### Panel 25: Multiple Passes
Dr. Erben reinserted the Fogarty catheter, advancing it again. This time it went further - the big clot was gone, opening the path. She inflated the balloon and pulled back. Another clot emerged, smaller but still significant. "Three-French catheter," she requested. The smaller catheter could reach even further distally, into the tibial vessels. Pass after pass, smaller clots and fragments came out. "The goal," she explained to the team, "is to keep going until we get fresh bleeding from below. That tells us the distal vessels are clear." On the seventh pass, bright red blood pulsed from the arteriotomy. "There it is! Good distal flow. We're clear."

### Panel 26: Fresh Bleeding - Sign of Success
"Look at that color," Dr. Erben said, indicating the bright red blood now flowing from the open artery. "That's fresh, oxygenated blood. It means the distal vessels are patent and there's good inflow from the heart. This is exactly what we want to see." The anesthesiologist peered over the drape: "Blood pressure is stable. Foot is looking pinker already." Dr. Erben glanced down at Carlos's foot, visible beyond the drapes. Where it had been pale and mottled, now a healthy pink was spreading from the ankle downward. "Perfusion is restoring. Beautiful."

### Panel 27: Closure with Patch Angioplasty
"Now we close this carefully," Dr. Erben said. "I don't like the way this arteriotomy looks - there's some plaque here that could narrow if we just close it primarily. I'm going to use a patch." The tech handed her a piece of bovine pericardium patch, pre-cut to size. With 6-0 Prolene suture on a delicate needle, Dr. Erben sutured the patch over the arteriotomy, each stitch precise and evenly spaced. The patch widened the artery, preventing narrowing. "This technique," she explained, "reduces the risk of early re-occlusion. We didn't go through all this just to have it close up again."

### Panel 28: Final Check - Foot Turning Pink
Dr. Erben released the clamps. Blood surged back into the artery. She felt for pulses - the femoral was strong, but more importantly, she moved down to the foot. There - at the dorsalis pedis - a faint pulse. "Give it a minute to fill the distal bed," she said. They waited. The pulse strengthened. Behind the ankle, the posterior tibial pulse appeared. "We have perfusion!" The Doppler probe confirmed it - strong triphasic signals in all distal vessels. Carlos's foot had gone from deathly pale to healthy pink. His toes, which had been dusky purple, were now normal color. Dr. Erben smiled behind her mask: "This leg is saved."

## Act 4: Recovery and Prevention (Panels 29-35)

### Panel 29: Post-Op - Wiggling Toes
In the recovery room, as the spinal anesthetic wore off, Carlos began to feel his leg again. Dr. Erben stood at the bedside: "Carlos, ¿puedes mover los dedos?" ("Can you move your toes?") He concentrated, and slowly, miraculously, his toes wiggled. First just a twitch, then deliberate movement. Tears streamed down his face. "¡Puedo moverlos! ¡Doctora, puedo moverlos!" ("I can move them! Doctor, I can move them!") Maria, allowed into recovery, clutched her husband, both of them weeping with relief. Dr. Erben's eyes glistened behind her glasses. This moment - this was why she did this work.

### Panel 30: Explaining the Source
Dr. Erben pulled up a chair, her surgical greens now replaced by clean scrubs. "Carlos, Maria, tenemos que hablar about why this happened," she began. She pulled out her phone, showing them a diagram of the heart. "Your heart's irregular rhythm - the atrial fibrillation - caused blood to pool in one of the chambers. That pooled blood formed a clot. The clot broke free, traveled through your arteries, and lodged in your leg." Carlos looked confused: "¿Pero por qué? Why did it go to my leg and not somewhere else?" Dr. Erben nodded: "Good question. Sometimes it goes to the brain - that causes a stroke. Sometimes the intestines, the kidneys. You were lucky it went to the leg - we can fix that."

### Panel 31: Cardiology Consultation Coming
"Tomorrow, a heart doctor - un cardiólogo - will come to see you," Dr. Erben continued. "We need to get your heart rhythm under control and, more importantly, start you on blood thinners. These medications will prevent new clots from forming." She pulled out a prescription pad and drew the cascade: "Heart rhythm problem → clot formation → travel through arteries → blockage. We need to break that chain. The blood thinner - anticoagulación - breaks it at step two." Carlos nodded slowly, absorbing the information. Maria asked: "¿Por cuánto tiempo? How long will he need these medicines?" Dr. Erben's answer was firm: "For life, Maria. For the rest of his life."

### Panel 32: The Critical Question
Maria's face crumpled, guilt and anger mixing. "Doctor, I have to ask you something." Her voice was shaking. "Carlos saw a cardiologist six months ago. They told him he had this... this atrial fibrillation. But no one gave him blood thinners. No one told us this could happen. Why? ¿Por qué didn't they protect him?" Dr. Erben felt the weight of the question. This was the system's failure, not hers, but she bore the responsibility of explaining it. "Sometimes," she said carefully, "doctors worry about bleeding risk. They weigh the risks and benefits. But in Carlos's case, I think - and I will discuss this with your cardiologist - he should have been on anticoagulation. This should have been prevented."

### Panel 33: Education About Future Risks
Dr. Erben opened her tablet, showing them statistics and diagrams. "Carlos, without blood thinners, you have a high risk - maybe 5% per year - of another clot. That clot could go to your leg again, or worse, to your brain causing a stroke. That's what we call embolic stroke." She showed them an illustration of a brain with a blocked vessel. "With blood thinners - with Coumadin or one of the newer medications - we reduce that risk to less than 1% per year. The medication has risks too - bleeding - but the benefit is much greater than the risk." She switched to Spanish: "Entiendes, Carlos? This is about more than your leg. This is about preventing a stroke that could leave you unable to speak, unable to walk, unable to live independently."

### Panel 34: Discharge Planning
Two days later, Dr. Erben sat with Carlos and Maria for discharge planning. "You're going home today," she said with a smile. "Your leg is healing well. The incision looks good. Your pulses are strong." She handed them a folder of papers. "Here's your prescription for Coumadin - warfarin. You'll start tonight with 5 milligrams. Tomorrow, you go to the lab for blood work - they'll check your INR, which tells us if the blood is thin enough. Your goal INR is 2 to 3." She explained the monitoring schedule, the dietary restrictions, the signs of bleeding to watch for. "And," she added firmly, "you have an appointment with the cardiologist next week. Don't miss it. He needs to optimize your heart rhythm medication too."

### Panel 35: Three-Month Follow-Up - Dancing Again
Three months later, Carlos returned for his vascular surgery follow-up. Dr. Erben walked into the exam room to find him standing, waiting for her. "Doctora!" he exclaimed, breaking into a broad smile. "¡Mira esto!" He lifted his left leg, stomped it on the ground, then did a little dance step. "I'm back in my gardens. Digging, planting, walking miles each day. My INR is perfect - 2.5 last week. No problems with the Coumadin." Maria beamed beside him. "He's even been dancing with me on Saturday nights, doctor. Like we used to when we were young." Dr. Erben felt her throat tighten with emotion. "Carlos, this is what success looks like. You did the hard part - you followed the plan, took your medications, got your blood checked. You saved your own leg as much as I did." They hugged, and as they left the clinic, Dr. Erben watched them walk down the hallway together, Carlos's gait strong and even. No limp. No amputation. Just life, restored.
