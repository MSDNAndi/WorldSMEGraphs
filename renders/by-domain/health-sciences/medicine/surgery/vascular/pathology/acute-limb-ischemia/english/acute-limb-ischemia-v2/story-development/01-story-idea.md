# Acute Limb Ischemia V2 - Story Idea

## Character Specification

**Main Character: Dr. Young Erben**
- **Ethnicity**: Korean
- **Physical**: Petite, in her 40s
- **Distinctive Feature**: Expressive rectangular glasses
- **Languages**: Spanish (grew up in Venezuela), English, German, Korean
- **Background**: Multilingual vascular surgeon with deep cultural sensitivity

**Patient: Carlos Ramirez**
- Venezuelan immigrant, 68 years old
- Speaks primarily Spanish
- History of atrial fibrillation (not on anticoagulation)
- Presenting with acute left leg ischemia

## Story Hook

3:00 AM emergency call - Dr. Erben rushes to the ER where Carlos Ramirez presents with a "dead leg" (his words in Spanish: "mi pierna está muerta"). The dramatic presentation of acute limb ischemia creates immediate tension - they have only 6-8 hours to restore blood flow before irreversible tissue death and potential amputation.

## Educational Goals

### Medical Learning Objectives
1. **Recognition**: Classic 6 Ps of acute limb ischemia (Pain, Pallor, Pulselessness, Paresthesias, Paralysis, Poikilothermia)
2. **Diagnosis**: Differentiating arterial embolism from thrombosis
3. **Time-Critical Management**: "Time is tissue" principle - golden 6-hour window
4. **Surgical Technique**: Fogarty catheter thromboembolectomy procedure details
5. **Cause Investigation**: Finding and treating atrial fibrillation as source
6. **Prevention**: Long-term anticoagulation and stroke risk management

### Cultural/Human Elements
1. Language barriers in emergency medicine
2. Dr. Erben's Venezuelan Spanish connecting with patient
3. Trust-building under time pressure
4. Family involvement in decision-making
5. Cultural competence in informed consent
6. Post-operative education across language differences

## Story Arc (35 Panels)

### Act 1: Emergency Recognition (Panels 1-10)
1. 3 AM phone call - Dr. Erben awakened by ER
2. Racing to hospital in pre-dawn darkness
3. ER arrival - Carlos in pain, leg pale and cold
4. Dr. Erben speaks to Carlos in Spanish - immediate trust
5. Rapid 6 Ps assessment - all present, paralysis developing
6. Doppler ultrasound - no signals in left leg
7. EKG shows atrial fibrillation - source found
8. Carlos's wife arrives, terrified about amputation
9. Dr. Erben explains: "We can save the leg - but we must move NOW"
10. Family consent discussion in Spanish and English

### Act 2: Surgical Preparation (Panels 11-18)
11. Team mobilization - calling in OR crew at 3:30 AM
12. Pre-op preparation - IV heparin bolus started
13. Surgical consent - Dr. Erben draws diagram for family
14. Carlos's fear: "Will I walk again, doctora?"
15. Dr. Erben's reassurance in Spanish
16. OR team assembling - checking Fogarty catheters
17. Anesthesia induction - spinal with sedation
18. Surgical prep and draping

### Act 3: Surgical Procedure (Panels 19-28)
19. Groin incision - exposing femoral artery
20. Proximal control achieved
21. Arteriotomy - dark clot visible
22. Fogarty catheter insertion - advancing distally
23. Balloon inflation explained (technical detail)
24. First pass extraction - large clot removed
25. Multiple passes - smaller clots coming out
26. Fresh bleeding from arteriotomy - sign of success!
27. Closure with patch angioplasty
28. Restoration check - foot turning pink

### Act 4: Recovery and Prevention (Panels 29-35)
29. Post-op - Carlos wiggling toes, crying with relief
30. Dr. Erben explains source: atrial fibrillation embolus
31. Cardiology consultation - need for anticoagulation
32. Wife's question: "Why wasn't he on blood thinners before?"
33. Education about stroke and limb risk with AFib
34. Discharge planning - Coumadin initiation, INR monitoring
35. 3-month follow-up - Carlos walking, dancing with wife

## Panel Count Rationale

35 panels allows for:
- Detailed emergency assessment (10 panels for 6 Ps + diagnosis)
- Realistic surgical preparation timeline (8 panels)
- Step-by-step procedural education (10 panels showing Fogarty technique)
- Comprehensive prevention education (7 panels)
- Emotional arcs for patient, family, and surgeon
- Cultural moments showing language and trust building

This is story-driven expansion - each panel serves narrative or educational purpose, not arbitrary padding to reach a number.

## Style Notes

- Dora the Explorer cartoon style (thick black outlines, flat bright colors)
- Dr. Erben's consistent appearance: Korean features, petite frame, rectangular black glasses, teal scrubs (non-OR) / surgical greens (OR)
- Spanish dialogue with English subtitles
- Clock/time indicators showing urgency
- Medical accuracy in anatomy and procedure depiction
- Emotional authenticity in facial expressions

## Key Medical Accuracy Points

- 6 Ps assessment must be systematic and complete
- Fogarty catheter technique accurately depicted
- Atrial fibrillation as embolic source clearly shown
- Time pressure realistic (6-hour window emphasized)
- Anticoagulation discussion medically appropriate
- Long-term management realistic

## Educational Impact

This story teaches:
1. Emergency vascular surgery recognition and management
2. Time-critical decision making
3. Surgical technique (Fogarty catheter use)
4. Prevention of recurrence
5. Cultural competence in emergency medicine
6. The human side of vascular surgery
