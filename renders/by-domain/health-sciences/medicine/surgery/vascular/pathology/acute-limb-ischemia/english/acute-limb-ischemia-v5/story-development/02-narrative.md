# Acute Limb Ischemia V5 - Narrative

## Diego's First Emergency

The fluorescent lights of the emergency department buzzed overhead as Diego adjusted his glasses nervously. It was his third week as a research intern under Dr. Young Erben, and today she had invited him to shadow her during her ER rotation.

Dr. Erben walked beside him, her petite frame moving with confident purpose through the busy corridor. Despite the chaos around them, she maintained an air of calm that Diego found reassuring.

"Emergency medicine is different from the research lab," she said, her warm smile putting him at ease. "Here, you'll see the conditions we study in real time. Are you ready?"

Diego nodded, though his heart was racing. "I think so, Dr. Erben."

Before she could respond, a nurse called out urgently. "Dr. Erben! Incoming—sixty-two-year-old male, sudden onset right leg pain, two hours ago."

Dr. Erben's expression sharpened. She turned to Diego. "This could be exactly what you need to see. Stay close and observe."

They rushed to the trauma bay where paramedics were wheeling in Mr. Patterson, a retired construction worker whose face was contorted in agony. His right leg was propped up, and even from across the room, Diego could see something was wrong—the limb looked pale, almost waxy.

"Mr. Patterson, I'm Dr. Erben, and this is Diego, one of our research interns. Can you tell me when the pain started?"

"About two hours ago," Mr. Patterson gasped. "I was just watching TV, and suddenly it felt like someone stabbed me in the leg. The pain is terrible, doc."

Dr. Erben gently examined the leg while explaining to Diego in a low voice. "Watch and learn. We're going to check for the 'Six Ps' of acute limb ischemia. First—Pain. Obviously present and severe."

She palpated the leg gently. "Feel here, Diego. Notice the temperature difference?"

Diego carefully touched the patient's right leg, then the left. "The right leg is much colder."

"Exactly. That's Poikilothermia—the limb takes on ambient temperature because warm blood isn't flowing. Now, check the color."

The right leg was noticeably paler than the left. "Pallor," Diego said, remembering his reading.

"Good. Now, let's check pulses." Dr. Erben demonstrated palpating the dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial arteries. "Feel for the pulse here."

Diego tried but felt nothing. "I can't find it."

"That's because there isn't one—Pulselessness. This confirms arterial occlusion." She turned to the nurse. "Get vascular surgery on the phone and prep for an emergency angiogram."

Mr. Patterson groaned. "What's happening to me, doc?"

Dr. Erben took his hand reassuringly. "Mr. Patterson, you have a blockage in the artery supplying blood to your leg. It's called acute limb ischemia. We need to act quickly to restore blood flow."

She continued her examination, testing sensation and movement. "Can you wiggle your toes for me?"

Mr. Patterson tried, but his toes barely moved. "They feel numb, like pins and needles."

"Paresthesia and early Paralysis," Dr. Erben noted. "Diego, we have all six Ps. What does that tell us about timing?"

Diego's mind raced through his textbook knowledge. "The 'golden hours'—we have about six hours from symptom onset before irreversible damage occurs."

"Exactly. And he's already two hours in. We need to move fast." She ordered labs, started anticoagulation with heparin, and called for the angiography suite.

As they prepared to transfer Mr. Patterson, Dr. Erben pulled Diego aside. "What causes acute limb ischemia?"

"Embolism or thrombosis?" Diego offered.

"Correct. In his case, with his history of atrial fibrillation—which the paramedics mentioned—this is likely an embolus from the heart. A clot formed in his fibrillating atrium, broke loose, and lodged in his leg artery."

The angiography suite was a flurry of controlled activity. Diego watched from behind the lead glass as Dr. Erben and the interventional team worked. The images on the screen showed a clear cutoff in the popliteal artery.

"There's our culprit," Dr. Erben pointed out. "See how the artery just stops? That's the embolus blocking blood flow."

They performed catheter-directed thrombolysis, threading a small catheter to the clot and infusing medication to dissolve it. Diego watched in fascination as the real-time images showed blood flow gradually restoring.

Hours later, Mr. Patterson was stable in the recovery unit, his leg pink and warm again, pulses palpable. Dr. Erben and Diego stood at his bedside.

"The color is back," Diego observed, genuinely amazed.

"That's what we call limb salvage," Dr. Erben said with satisfaction. "Mr. Patterson, you're going to keep your leg, but we need to talk about preventing this from happening again."

She explained the importance of anticoagulation for his atrial fibrillation and the need for regular follow-up. Mr. Patterson nodded, grateful tears in his eyes.

As they left the room, Dr. Erben turned to Diego. "So, what did you learn today?"

Diego took a deep breath. "That acute limb ischemia is a time-critical emergency. The Six Ps help us recognize it quickly. And early intervention can mean the difference between saving a limb and losing it."

Dr. Erben nodded approvingly. "And now you've seen it firsthand. That's something no textbook can fully teach you. Well done, Diego."

Diego smiled, his earlier nervousness replaced by a sense of accomplishment. He had a lot more to learn, but today had shown him why this work mattered—and why Dr. Erben was such an excellent teacher.
