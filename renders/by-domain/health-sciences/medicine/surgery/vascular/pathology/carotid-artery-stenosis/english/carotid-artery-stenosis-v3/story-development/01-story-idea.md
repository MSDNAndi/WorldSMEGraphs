# Carotid Artery Stenosis V3 - Story Idea

## UNIQUE NARRATIVE FOCUS: The Warning Signs

**Theme**: Transient ischemic attack as a "stroke warning" - the window of opportunity

**What makes this story different**:
- Focus on TIA recognition by family member
- Adult daughter's perspective driving the narrative
- Emphasis on shared decision-making
- No language/cultural barriers - straight medical education

## Character: Dr. James Patel

- **Ethnicity**: Indian-American
- **Age**: 58
- **Background**: Cerebrovascular specialist, 30 years experience
- **Style**: Grandfatherly, patient, draws diagrams, involves family
- **Specialty**: Carotid endarterectomy, stroke prevention

## Patient: Margaret "Peggy" O'Brien

- **Age**: 72
- **Background**: Retired librarian, widow, lives independently
- **Health History**: High cholesterol, hypertension, former smoker (quit 10 years)
- **Presentation**: Transient weakness and speech difficulty witnessed by daughter
- **Personality**: Independent, resists being "fussed over"

## Secondary Character: Lisa O'Brien (daughter)

- **Age**: 45
- **Background**: School teacher, caregiver for mother
- **Role**: Witnessed the TIA, drives medical decisions, asks the questions

## Story Hook

During Sunday dinner, Lisa notices her mother's face drooping and words slurring for 3 minutes before it resolves. Peggy insists she's "fine now," but Lisa, remembering her father's stroke, rushes her mother to the ER. Dr. Patel must convince this stubborn, independent woman that her 5-minute "episode" was a warning of an impending major stroke - and she has a narrow window to prevent it.

## Educational Goals

### Clinical Focus
1. **TIA recognition** - FAST signs (Face, Arms, Speech, Time)
2. **TIA vs. stroke** - Same mechanism, different duration
3. **Carotid stenosis mechanism** - Plaque causing embolism
4. **Imaging workup** - Ultrasound, CTA, brain MRI
5. **Risk stratification** - NASCET criteria, when to operate
6. **Surgical vs. medical management** - Decision tree
7. **Carotid endarterectomy** - Step-by-step procedure
8. **Secondary prevention** - Lifelong risk management

## Visual Style

- Dora the Explorer cartoon aesthetic
- Thick black outlines, flat bright colors

- Peggy: White elderly woman, short gray hair, glasses, cardigan
- Lisa: Middle-aged woman, brown hair in ponytail, concerned expression
