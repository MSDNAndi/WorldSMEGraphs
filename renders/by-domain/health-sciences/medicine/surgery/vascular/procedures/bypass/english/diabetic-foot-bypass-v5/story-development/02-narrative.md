# Diabetic Foot Bypass V5 - Narrative

## The Team Challenge

The conference room was crowded as Dr. Young Erben laid out the complex case before her three research interns. Diego, Camilo, and Camila sat in a row, notebooks open and pens ready.

"This is going to be a team effort," the petite Korean physician began, pulling up imaging on the screen. "Mr. Williams is a 62-year-old diabetic with a non-healing foot ulcer. His primary care doctor has referred him to us because his circulation is severely compromised."

Diego adjusted his glasses, studying the images intently. "Is that why the ulcer won't heal? Poor blood supply?"

"Exactly. Diabetic patients develop peripheral arterial disease at higher rates, and when combined with neuropathy and minor trauma, you get this." She pointed to a photo of a deep ulcer on the bottom of the foot. "This has been present for four months despite wound care."

Camila winced sympathetically. "That must be painful."

"That's where it gets complicated. Diabetic neuropathy means he barely feels it—which is part of how it developed in the first place. He didn't notice the small injury that started it all."

Dr. Erben assigned each intern a role. "Diego, I want you to focus on the vascular assessment. Camilo, you'll handle the research on bypass options. Camila, you're our patient communication lead—you'll help coordinate with podiatry and infectious disease."

Over the following days, the team dove into their assignments. Diego worked through the ankle-brachial index measurements and reviewed the angiogram with Dr. Erben.

"The superficial femoral artery is completely occluded," he observed, tracing the image. "But there's a patent vessel distally—the posterior tibial."

"Good eye," Dr. Erben praised. "That's our target. We can bypass from the femoral artery to that vessel, restoring blood flow to the foot."

Meanwhile, Camilo researched bypass conduit options. "Autogenous vein is preferred," he reported at their team meeting. "The great saphenous vein has the best long-term patency rates for below-knee bypasses."

Camila had been meeting with Mr. Williams regularly, building rapport and helping coordinate his multidisciplinary care. "He's scared," she reported. "But I've explained that this surgery gives his ulcer the best chance to heal. Podiatry has debrided the wound, and ID cleared his infection with antibiotics."

On surgery day, all three interns observed from the gallery. Dr. Erben had invited them to watch the procedure she called "one of the most satisfying in vascular surgery."

The surgery was meticulous. Dr. Erben harvested the saphenous vein from Mr. Williams' leg, reversed it, and carefully anastomosed it from the femoral artery to the posterior tibial artery—creating a new pathway for blood flow that bypassed the blocked segment.

"When we release the clamps," she explained through the intercom, "we should see the foot perfuse."

The interns held their breath. As the clamps came off, color began to return to Mr. Williams' foot, the pulse now palpable where before there had been none.

"That's limb salvage," Diego whispered, amazed.

The post-operative period required continued teamwork. Camila worked with the wound care team on dressing changes. Diego monitored the bypass graft patency with daily pulse checks and Doppler signals. Camilo researched and presented on the optimal antiplatelet and risk factor modification regimen.

Two weeks later, the ulcer showed clear signs of healing—new tissue forming where before there had been only dead, blackened skin.

Mr. Williams was emotional during his follow-up visit. "I thought I was going to lose my foot," he admitted. "My father did—from diabetes. I never thought I could avoid the same fate."

Dr. Erben smiled gently. "With good blood flow, wound care, and diabetes management, you can keep your foot. But you have to be our partner in this. Blood sugar control, foot checks, regular follow-ups."

"I will," he promised. "I've seen what your team can do. I'm not going to waste it."

After Mr. Williams left, Dr. Erben gathered her interns. "What did you learn from this case?"

Diego spoke first. "That vascular surgery can save limbs—but it's not just about the operation. It's about everything that comes before and after."

Camilo added, "The research showed me how much evidence goes into choosing the right procedure, the right conduit, the right medications."

Camila smiled. "And I learned that patients aren't just cases—they're people with fears and hopes and families. Mr. Williams was thinking about his father the whole time. Connecting with him made a difference."

Dr. Erben nodded, pride evident in her expression. "You three make an excellent team. Medicine is teamwork—always. Never forget that."

The interns exchanged glances, feeling a sense of accomplishment and camaraderie that would shape their careers for years to come.
