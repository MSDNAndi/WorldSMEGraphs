# Diabetic Foot Bypass V3 - Full Narrative

## The Long Road

Sergeant First Class Thomas Jackson (Retired) had survived two tours in Iraq, an IED blast that killed three men in his squad, and twenty-two years of Army life that had broken stronger men than him. But the wound on his right foot was something he couldn't outmaneuver, couldn't outfight, and couldn't ignore anymore.

The ulcer had started small—a blister from new shoes three months ago. In a healthy person, it would have healed in two weeks. In Tom, with twenty years of poorly controlled diabetes destroying his blood vessels and nerves, it had become a crater. Black edges. Deep enough to see tendon. The smell of infection.

He sat in his apartment, foot propped on a pillow, wondering if this was how it ended. Not in Baghdad, but in Baltimore. Not from a bullet, but from diabetes.

His son Kevin knocked on the door—a habit from childhood, even though he had a key.

"Dad, I'm coming in."

Kevin Jackson was thirty, an Army medic who had done his own tours in Afghanistan. He'd seen wounds of every kind. When he unwrapped his father's foot and saw the ulcer, his face went pale.

"Jesus, Dad. How long has it been like this?"

"It's getting better."

"This is not getting better. This is necrosing. When did you last see a doctor?"

Tom looked away. "The VA doc said there wasn't much they could do. Said I might need an amputation."

"That was their advice? Amputate?" Kevin's jaw tightened. "We're getting a second opinion. Pack a bag."

Dr. Amara Diallo's office at the VA hospital was covered with diplomas and anatomical charts, but what caught Tom's attention was a photo on her desk: a soldier in desert camo, grinning at the camera. Her brother, he'd later learn, killed in Kandahar.

She understood veterans.

"Mr. Jackson, let me examine your foot."

Tom had been examined by a dozen doctors in his life. Most of them had a clinical distance—professional but detached. Dr. Diallo was different. She touched his foot gently, probed the wound carefully, assessed not just the ulcer but the man attached to it.

"Tell me about your diabetes."

"Twenty years. Type 2. I take the pills when I remember."

"What's your last HbA1c?"

"Eleven-something."

"That's dangerously high. Normal is under 5.7. Diabetic goal is under 7." She pulled up a diagram on her computer. "This is what's happening to your arteries."

The image showed the arterial tree of a diabetic leg—the large vessels open, but the smaller vessels below the knee occluded, calcified, destroyed by years of elevated blood sugar.

"Your big arteries are okay, but the small ones that feed your foot are blocked. That's why the wound isn't healing—there's not enough blood getting to the tissue."

"So I need an amputation."

"I didn't say that." Dr. Diallo pulled up another image. "I said the small arteries are blocked. But there's often one that's still open—a target vessel. If I can find it, I can bypass to it. Connect a healthy artery above the blockages to a healthy artery below them, using your own vein."

"Is that possible?"

"It's technically challenging. It requires microsurgical technique and sometimes hours of work. But I've saved a lot of legs that other doctors gave up on."

Kevin leaned forward. "What does he need to do?"

"This isn't just surgery. This is a contract. I can give you a new blood supply, but if your diabetes isn't controlled, the bypass will fail and you'll lose the leg anyway. I need you to commit to controlling your diabetes—working with endocrinology, following the diet, taking your medications."

Tom was quiet. He'd never been good at taking care of himself. He'd spent his career taking care of soldiers, of missions, of objectives. His own body was always secondary.

"I didn't survive Baghdad to lose my foot at home," he said finally.

"Is that a yes?"

"That's a yes."

The angiogram revealed what Dr. Diallo had hoped to find: while most of the tibial arteries were blocked, the dorsalis pedis—the artery running over the top of the foot—had a patent segment. Small, but viable. A target.

"I can work with this," she told Tom and Kevin after the procedure. "The bypass will go from your popliteal artery behind your knee to this artery on your foot. We'll use your saphenous vein from your thigh as the conduit."

"How long is the surgery?"

"Four to six hours. Possibly longer if there are complications."

Tom nodded. He'd been through worse.

---

The vein mapping was done the day before surgery—an ultrasound tracing the course of the saphenous vein, marking it on the skin so Dr. Diallo would know exactly where to harvest. The vein was good: adequate diameter, no significant branches, suitable for bypass.

In the operating room, Tom lay on his back, leg prepped from groin to toes. The anesthesiologist kept him deeply sedated—this would be a long operation.

Dr. Diallo made her first incision on the inner thigh, exposing the saphenous vein. Carefully, she harvested a long segment—twelve inches of vein that would become the bypass conduit. She reversed it (so the valves would allow blood to flow in the right direction) and set it aside.

Next, she exposed the popliteal artery behind the knee—healthy, pulsatile, good inflow. This would be the source.

The ankle was next: a longer incision, careful dissection through scarred and edematous tissue, until she found the dorsalis pedis artery. It was small—three millimeters in diameter—but it was open.

"Bringing in the microscope."

The operating microscope magnified the tiny vessel to workable size. Dr. Diallo's sutures were finer than human hair, each one placed with precision born of thousands of hours of practice.

The proximal anastomosis was completed first—vein to popliteal artery. Blood surged into the graft.

The vein was tunneled through the leg, following the anatomical pathway.

The distal anastomosis came last—the most delicate part. Suture by suture, the vein was connected to the tiny artery. Twenty stitches. Forty minutes.

When the clamps were released, Dr. Diallo held her breath. Then she heard it through the Doppler: a strong signal in the foot. Blood was flowing.

"Bypass is patent. Good signal throughout."

Recovery was not easy. The wound on Tom's foot slowly began to heal—finally getting the blood supply it needed. But healing would take months, not weeks.

The harder part was the lifestyle change.

Dr. Maria Santos, the endocrinologist, worked with Tom on a complete diabetes overhaul: new medications, including insulin; a meal plan he could actually follow; regular exercise once his foot allowed it. Kevin helped where he could, calling daily, visiting weekly.

At three months, Tom's HbA1c had dropped from 11 to 8.2. Not goal yet, but progress.

At six months, it was 7.4. Nearly there.

The foot wound had closed completely, leaving a scar where the ulcer had been. The bypass remained open, verified by ultrasound every three months.

One year after his surgery, Tom Jackson stood at the podium of a veterans' diabetes support group at the VA. Thirty veterans sat in folding chairs, some with their own wounds, some still in denial, some just starting to understand what uncontrolled diabetes could do.

"I almost lost my foot," Tom told them. "Not in combat—from diabetes. From not taking care of myself. From thinking I was too tough to worry about blood sugar."

He rolled up his pants leg, showing the scars from his surgery.

"Dr. Diallo saved my leg. But she couldn't save my leg without me. I had to change. I had to check my feet every day, take my medications, control my diet. The surgery was the easy part—she did that while I was asleep. The hard part is everything after."

He pointed to a poster on the wall: a simple checklist for diabetic foot care.

"Check your feet every day. Every single day. Feel for wounds you can't see because the neuropathy makes you numb. Cut your toenails carefully. Wear shoes that fit. And for God's sake, keep your blood sugar under control."

A younger veteran in the front row—missing two toes on his right foot—raised his hand. "Is it too late for me?"

Tom looked at him, saw himself from a year ago, scared and in denial.

"It's never too late to start doing the right thing. But don't wait until you're in my situation. Act now, while you still have options."

---

After the meeting, Dr. Diallo found Tom in the hallway.

"Good talk in there, Sergeant."

"Just telling the truth, doc."

"That's the best medicine sometimes." She handed him a small box. "Your one-year anniversary gift."

Inside was a lapel pin—the VA seal with a small foot icon beneath it.

"Limb Salvage Champion," she explained. "You earned it."

Tom pinned it to his jacket, next to his Army service ribbons.

"Survived Baghdad," he said. "Survived Baltimore."

"Now keep surviving. I'll see you in three months for your next ultrasound."

Tom walked out of the VA on both feet—not fast, not gracefully, but walking. One year ago, that had seemed impossible.

Now it was just the first step on a long road he was finally ready to travel.
