# Diabetic Foot Bypass V3 - Story Idea

## UNIQUE NARRATIVE FOCUS: The Long Road

**Theme**: Chronic disease management failure leading to limb-threatening crisis

**What makes this story different**:
- Focus on diabetes management and prevention
- Veteran patient with VA healthcare access issues
- Male patient perspective (vs. typical female diabetic foot presentations)
- Emphasis on multidisciplinary care (podiatry, endocrinology, vascular)

## Character: Dr. Amara Diallo

- **Ethnicity**: Senegalese-American
- **Age**: 42
- **Background**: Trained at Johns Hopkins, now practices at VA hospital
- **Style**: Direct, practical, doesn't sugarcoat, advocates for patients
- **Specialty**: Distal bypass, limb salvage, wound care

## Patient: Sergeant First Class (Ret.) Thomas Jackson

- **Age**: 58
- **Background**: Army veteran, 22 years service, Iraq veteran
- **Health History**: Type 2 diabetes x 20 years, peripheral neuropathy, smoked until 50
- **Presentation**: Non-healing foot ulcer x 3 months, told by another doctor "might need amputation"
- **Personality**: Stoic, used to following orders, but doesn't take care of himself

## Secondary Characters:
- **Dr. Maria Santos** - Endocrinologist, diabetes management
- **Kevin Jackson** - Son, Army medic, pushes father to seek help

## Story Hook

Tom Jackson survived combat in Iraq but ignored his diabetes for 20 years. Now his foot is dying from the inside out. His son, an Army medic, drags him to the VA for a second opinion before the scheduled amputation. Dr. Diallo offers a last chance: a technically challenging bypass to a tiny artery in his foot - if he commits to controlling his diabetes.

## Educational Goals

### Clinical Focus
1. **Diabetic peripheral arterial disease** - Why diabetics are different
2. **Wound assessment** - Wagner classification, infection signs
3. **Arterial anatomy** - Tibial vessels, angiosome concept
4. **Non-invasive testing** - ABI, toe pressures, TcPO2
5. **Angiography** - Finding a target vessel
6. **Vein mapping** - Saphenous vein as bypass conduit
7. **Distal bypass technique** - Microscope-assisted anastomosis
8. **Multidisciplinary care** - Podiatry, endocrinology, wound care
9. **Diabetes control** - HbA1c goals, lifestyle changes
10. **Limb surveillance** - Preventing the other foot

## Story Arc (30 Panels)

### Act 1: The Veteran's Dilemma (Panels 1-8)
1. Tom at home, foot wrapped, can't walk to mailbox
2. Flashback - him healthy in uniform, 20 years ago
3. Son Kevin visiting, noticing the wound smell
4. Kevin: "Dad, let me look at that foot"
5. Wound exposed - deep ulcer, black edges
6. Kevin's face: "You're not losing this foot"
7. VA hospital entrance - "Getting a second opinion"
8. Meeting Dr. Diallo in vascular clinic

### Act 2: The Assessment (Panels 9-15)
9. Dr. Diallo examining the foot, probing wound
10. Pulse exam - no pulses below knee
11. ABI testing - showing severely low numbers
12. "Your arteries are blocked, but let me see what's left"
13. Angiogram suite - catheter in groin
14. Angiogram showing blocked vessels, one patent distal target
15. Dr. Diallo: "I can bypass to this artery - but YOU have to control the diabetes"

### Act 3: The Deal (Panels 16-18)
16. Family meeting - Kevin, Tom, Dr. Diallo, Dr. Santos (endocrinologist)
17. Dr. Santos: "Your HbA1c is 11. It needs to be under 7"
18. Tom agrees: "I didn't survive Baghdad to lose my foot at home"

### Act 4: The Surgery (Panels 19-26)
19. Vein mapping - marking saphenous vein on leg
20. OR setup - microscope positioned
21. Vein harvest - long incision on thigh
22. Ankle exposure - identifying dorsalis pedis artery
23. Proximal anastomosis to popliteal artery
24. Vein tunneled through leg
25. Distal anastomosis under microscope - tiny sutures
26. Flow check - Doppler signal in foot

### Act 5: The New Mission (Panels 27-30)
27. Post-op - Tom's wound starting to heal
28. Physical therapy - Tom learning to walk again
29. Endocrinology visit - HbA1c now 7.2
30. Tom speaking at veterans' diabetes support group: "Check your feet every day"

## Visual Style

- Dora the Explorer cartoon aesthetic
- Thick black outlines, flat bright colors
- Dr. Diallo: Tall Black woman, short natural hair, confident stance, surgical cap
- Tom: Medium height, graying Black man, military posture, cane
- Kevin: Younger, fit, Army medic insignia on jacket
