# Diabetic Foot Bypass V4 - Full Narrative

## "The Team Challenge"

Dr. Young Erben stood before her three research interns, a thick patient chart in her hands. Diego, Camila, and Camilo sat around the conference table, recognizing the serious expression that meant something significant was about to happen.

"This case," Dr. Erben began, placing the chart on the table, "is one of the most complex we've seen this month. I could handle it myself, but I think it's the perfect opportunity for you three to work as a team."

She opened the chart, revealing the face of Mr. Washington—a 62-year-old retired bus driver with a gentle smile in his photograph, despite the circumstances that had brought him to the vascular surgery service.

"Mr. Washington has had diabetes for twenty years. He developed a small wound on his foot three months ago from an ill-fitting shoe. Despite aggressive wound care, it's not healing. Our job is to figure out why and fix it."

Diego leaned forward, his glasses catching the light. "Is it a vascular issue? Poor blood flow preventing healing?"

"That's what you're going to determine. I want you to own this case—the assessment, the planning, the education. Each of you will tackle a different aspect, and then we'll synthesize your findings into a treatment plan."

She assigned roles: Diego would evaluate Mr. Washington's arterial circulation using non-invasive vascular studies. Camila would focus on patient education, wound care coordination, and understanding the patient's social situation. Camilo would research bypass surgery options and develop the surgical plan if intervention was needed.

"You have three days. Then we meet, share findings, and decide together."

The team dispersed, each energized by the responsibility.

Diego began with the ankle-brachial index—a simple but critical test comparing blood pressure in the ankles to the arms. Mr. Washington's ABI was 0.5 on the affected leg, confirming significant arterial disease.

"Normally it should be 1.0 or higher," Diego explained to Mr. Washington, who listened carefully. "Your reading tells us your leg isn't getting enough blood flow. That's why your wound can't heal—the tissue isn't receiving the oxygen and nutrients it needs."

The arterial duplex ultrasound revealed the problem: severe blockages in the superficial femoral and popliteal arteries. The blood flow to Mr. Washington's foot was critically compromised.

"So my blood can't get through?" Mr. Washington asked.

"Exactly. And we need to fix that before your wound can ever heal properly."

Meanwhile, Camila spent hours with Mr. Washington, learning about more than just his medical history. She discovered he was a widower who lived alone, that his diabetes management had slipped since his wife passed two years ago, and that he was terrified of losing his leg.

"My wife always reminded me to check my blood sugar," he admitted. "Without her, I let things slide."

Camila felt a wave of compassion. This wasn't just about blocked arteries—it was about grief, loneliness, and the challenge of managing a chronic disease without support.

She arranged for a diabetes educator to work with Mr. Washington, connected him with a social worker for ongoing support, and coordinated with the wound care team to optimize dressing protocols. She also learned that his hemoglobin A1c was elevated at 10.2%—poorly controlled diabetes that would impair healing even with restored blood flow.

"Getting your blood sugar better controlled is just as important as the surgery," she explained. "They work together."

Camilo, meanwhile, dove into the surgical options. He studied CT angiography images, traced the extent of the blockages, and researched conduit choices for bypass.

"The saphenous vein is the gold standard for below-knee bypass," he explained to Diego and Camila during one of their informal team meetings. "It's the patient's own tissue, so there's no rejection risk, and long-term patency rates are better than synthetic grafts."

"But what if the vein isn't good enough?" Diego asked.

"That's a concern with diabetics—they can have vein disease too. We'll need to map the vein with ultrasound to make sure it's suitable."

The vein mapping showed adequate saphenous vein, and Camilo developed a surgical plan: femoral-to-anterior tibial bypass using reversed saphenous vein graft. He prepared a detailed operative approach, anticipating challenges and solutions.

Three days later, the team gathered with Dr. Erben to present their findings.

Diego presented the vascular assessment: "Mr. Washington has severe tibial artery disease. ABI is 0.5, duplex shows superficial femoral artery occlusion and popliteal disease. His anterior tibial artery has a patent distal segment—that's our target."

Camila presented the patient context: "Beyond the vascular issues, we need to address his social support and diabetes control. A1c is 10.2%. He's motivated but needs help. I've arranged diabetes education and social work support."

Camilo presented the surgical plan: "Femoral-to-anterior tibial bypass using his greater saphenous vein, which mapped well at 3mm diameter throughout. I've outlined the approach, including inflow from the common femoral and outflow to the anterior tibial at the ankle."

Dr. Erben listened carefully, asking probing questions about each component. When they finished, she smiled.

"This is exactly what comprehensive vascular care looks like. You've each contributed essential pieces: the diagnosis, the patient understanding, and the surgical plan. Together, you've created a complete picture."

The surgery happened the following week. Dr. Erben performed the bypass with all three interns observing at various stages. Diego monitored the intraoperative Doppler signals as the anastomoses were completed. Camila had prepared Mr. Washington emotionally for the procedure. Camilo followed the technical steps, matching what he saw to the plan he had created.

When the vein graft was connected and unclamped, the Doppler filled with the sound of rushing blood—the sweet whoosh of restored circulation.

"There it is," Dr. Erben said. "Blood flow to the foot."

Post-operatively, Mr. Washington's wound began to transform. Within two weeks, granulation tissue appeared—healthy red tissue indicating healing had begun. His foot, which had been pale and cool, was now pink and warm.

"I can feel my toes again," Mr. Washington told the team during a follow-up visit. "They tingle sometimes, but it's like they woke up."

His hemoglobin A1c was also improving with the help of the diabetes educator. The social worker had connected him with a local senior center where he'd started playing chess with other retirees.

"I'm not just surviving now," he said. "I'm living."

The team celebrated quietly after Mr. Washington left—not with fanfare, but with the deep satisfaction of work well done.

"What did you each learn?" Dr. Erben asked.

Diego spoke first: "That vascular assessment isn't just about numbers. It's about understanding what those numbers mean for a person's life."

Camila added: "That the patient is a whole person, not just a wound or a blocked artery. Addressing the human factors was as important as the surgery."

Camilo concluded: "That surgical planning requires integrating everything—the anatomy, the patient factors, the goals. It's a puzzle, and every piece matters."

Dr. Erben nodded, visibly proud. "You've learned the most important lesson in medicine: no one can do this alone. Vascular surgery is a team sport, and you three just proved you can play at the highest level."

As they left the hospital that evening, the three interns walked together, animated with conversation about the case, what they'd learned, and what challenges might come next.

They were more than colleagues now. They were a team—bound by the shared experience of helping someone keep his leg, regain his health, and rediscover his will to live.

That was the true reward of this work.
