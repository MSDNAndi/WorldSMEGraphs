### Dialogue (Enhanced)
**Diego** 🎭 *Statistical rigor, matter-of-fact*  
"Power calculation says 34 patients minimum for 80% power, alpha 0.05, detecting medium effect size."

**Camilo** 🎭 *Practical concern, overwhelmed*  
"Thirty-four patients?! That's... a lot. How long will recruitment take? 18 months?"

**Camila** 🎭 *Adjusting expectations*  
"That's longer than I thought... way longer. Research really IS a marathon, not a sprint."

**Diego** 🎭 *Commitment despite challenge*  
"Add 10% for loss to follow-up... so 38 patients, 18-24 months. Big commitment."

**Camilo** 🎭 *Resolve, deep breath*  
"Worth it if we answer the question RIGHT. Half-done research is worthless. Let's do it properly."

**Interactive to Reader** 💬  
"Why is adequate sample size SO important? What goes wrong if it's too small? 🧮"
