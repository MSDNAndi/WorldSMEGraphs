# Hyper-Detailed Prompt Engineering Guide
## Type 2 Endoleak Comic - GPT Image 1.5 Generation

### Purpose
This guide explains the methodology for creating hyper-detailed, comprehensive prompts (up to 32,000 characters each) for GPT Image 1.5 generation. These prompts eliminate guesswork and ensure precise, consistent visual output.

### Why Hyper-Detailed Prompts Matter

**Previous Problems (PR #36):**
- Prompts were 200-400 words (~1,500-3,000 characters)
- Used placeholder shorthand like "Apply STYLE BASE"
- Left composition, framing, and details to AI interpretation
- Resulted in inconsistent character appearances
- Background elements varied unpredictably
- Text placement was imprecise

**New Approach:**
- Each prompt: 8,000-15,000 characters (up to 32K available)
- Every visual element explicitly specified
- No placeholders or references to external style guides
- Character positions, expressions, gestures defined precisely
- Composition, framing, camera angle detailed
- Lighting, shadows, colors specified with precision
- Text placement, size, font characteristics described
- Background elements enumerated completely

### Prompt Structure Template

Each prompt should contain these sections (in order):

#### 1. STYLE FOUNDATION (1,500-2,000 chars)
```
Art Style: [Comprehensive description]
- Visual language: Dora the Explorer inspired educational illustration
- Rendering: 2D flat illustration with thick black outlines (3-4px weight)
- Color palette: Bright, saturated pastels - sky blues (#87CEEB), grass greens (#90EE90),
  sunshine yellows (#FFD700), warm oranges (#FFA500), soft purples (#DDA0DD)
- Line quality: Bold, confident, friendly strokes; no sketchy or rough edges
- Shading: Minimal cel-shading style; single soft shadow on ground plane only
- Texture: Smooth, vector-like appearance; no heavy texture or grain
- Lighting: Bright, even, cheerful; simulating midday outdoor light
- Perspective: Slight isometric feel; gentle depth without aggressive foreshortening
```

#### 2. CHARACTER SPECIFICATIONS (2,000-3,000 chars per character)
```

- Ethnicity & Features: Ecuadorian heritage, warm light brown skin (hex #D4A574), 
  youthful face (early 20s), round friendly features, brown eyes, genuine smile
  showing slight dimples, long dark brown hair in single braid over LEFT shoulder
  (braid reaches mid-torso, secured with purple hair tie)

  angle, LEFT hand holding clipboard against hip, head tilted 15 degrees to 
  RIGHT, eyes wide with excitement, mouth open in mid-speech smile"]
  
- Position in Frame: [Exact placement - e.g., "Positioned LEFT-CENTER of frame,
  occupying vertical 60-85% of frame height, facing 30 degrees to viewer's RIGHT,
  3 feet in front of background easel, casting subtle shadow extending to
  viewer's RIGHT"]
```

*Repeat for Camilo, Diego, and Dr. Erben if present*

#### 3. SCENE COMPOSITION & FRAMING (1,500-2,000 chars)
```
Camera/Viewpoint:
- Angle: Eye-level, slight low angle (5 degrees below eye line)

- Depth of field: All elements in focus; no blur

Foreground Elements:
- Ground plane: Textured concrete courtyard (hex #C0C0C0) with subtle grid lines
- Ground markings: Colorful chalk-like arrows (orange, blue, green) pointing toward
  easel, drawn in playful child-like style, 2-3 feet long each
- Small potted plant: Lower RIGHT corner, green leaves, terracotta pot

```

#### 4. KEY VISUAL ELEMENTS (1,000-1,500 chars)
```
Primary Focus Element:
- Aorta Diagram on Easel:
  * Size: 24" x 36" presentation board
  * Content: Simplified anatomical diagram showing descending aorta (red tube),
    aneurysm sac (bulging section mid-diagram), stent graft (gray mesh overlay),
    lumbar artery branches (smaller red tubes branching LEFT and RIGHT)
  * Labels: "Type 2 Endoleak" in bold red text, "Retrograde Flow" with dotted
    arrow showing flow direction INTO sac from branch
  * Style: Medical illustration style but simplified/friendly, using same bright
    colors as overall comic palette
  * Border: Thin black outline around entire board

Secondary Elements:
- Clipboards: Each character holds one, brown hardboard backing, white paper with
  blue grid lines visible, metal clip at top

```

### Total Prompt Length Target

**Minimum per prompt:** 8,000 characters
**Target per prompt:** 10,000-15,000 characters  
**Maximum per prompt:** 32,000 characters

### Critical Rules

1. **NO PLACEHOLDERS**: Never use "Apply STYLE BASE" or references to external docs
2. **NO ASSUMPTIONS**: Specify everything; assume AI knows nothing about previous panels
3. **EXPLICIT POSITIONING**: Use precise spatial language (LEFT/RIGHT, degrees, distances)
4. **CONSISTENT CHARACTER MODELS**: Character descriptions must be identical across all 32 prompts
5. **DIRECTIONAL CLARITY**: Always specify LEFT/RIGHT from viewer's perspective, not character's
6. **ARROW DIRECTIONS**: For any arrows showing flow or direction, specify: "Arrow points from [exact position] to [exact position], with arrowhead on the [LEFT/RIGHT/TOP/BOTTOM] end"
7. **MEASUREMENT SCALE**: Use proportional measurements (percentages of frame, or relative sizes)
8. **COLOR PRECISION**: Always provide hex codes for exact color matching
9. **TEXT EXACTNESS**: Quote all text exactly as it should appear; specify font characteristics
10. **CONTINUITY**: Each prompt must work standalone but maintain series continuity

### Examples of Super Explicit Directional Language

**BAD:**
```
"arrows showing data flow"
```

**GOOD:**
```
"Three arrows flowing from LEFT to RIGHT across the frame, originating at the lumbar 
artery branch (positioned at LEFT 25% of frame) and terminating at the aneurysm sac 
(positioned at CENTER-RIGHT 70% of frame). Each arrow is rendered as a solid orange 
line (hex #FFA500, 4px weight) with a triangular arrowhead on the RIGHT terminus 
(pointing RIGHTWARD), measuring 20px wide by 15px tall. The arrows curve gently 
upward in their middle section (apex at 60% of journey, elevated 30px above start 
point) before descending to meet the sac. Flow direction is unmistakably LEFT-TO-RIGHT, 
representing blood flowing INTO the sac from the branch vessel."
```

### Generation Workflow

1. **Write all 32 prompts completely** before generating any images
2. **Save prompts** to `gpt-prompts-v2-detailed.txt` with clear panel separators
3. **Review each prompt** for completeness (8K+ characters minimum)
4. **Validate consistency** across all 32 prompts (character descriptions identical)
5. **Generate images** using:
   ```bash
   python .project/agents/image-generation/tools/gpt_image_generator.py \
     --prompt-file gpt-prompts-v2-detailed.txt \
     --output-dir panels-gpt-v2 \
     --aspect landscape --quality high --parallel 4 --enhance
   ```

### Benefits of This Approach

✅ **Eliminates guesswork** - AI has complete specification
✅ **Ensures consistency** - Character models identical every panel  
✅ **Precise composition** - Exact framing and layout control
✅ **Professional quality** - Detailed specifications yield better results
✅ **Reproducible** - Same prompt generates same result
✅ **No placeholder dependencies** - Each prompt is self-contained
✅ **Faster iteration** - Clear specifications reduce generation retries
