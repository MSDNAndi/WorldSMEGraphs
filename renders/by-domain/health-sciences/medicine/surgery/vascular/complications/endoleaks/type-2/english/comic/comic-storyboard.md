# Type 2 Endoleak Research Comic — Structured Storyboard

## Goals
- Keep the story self-explanatory through speech bubbles only.
- Embed scientific rigor: sac growth thresholds, source-vessel mapping, imaging phases, and embolization options.
- Highlight novel ideas: CEUS microbubble persistence, dual-phase CTA overlay, sac pressure probe.
- Maintain the Dora-style exploration vibe without copying characters.

## Story Spine (8 beats)
1. **Mission Brief** — Meet the trio, set the 30+ panel target.
2. **Define the Leak** — Retrograde collateral inflow vs seal failure.
3. **Risk Signal** — Sac growth >5 mm or diameter >60 mm triggers action.
4. **See the Flow** — CTA arterial + delayed, source-vessel hunt.
5. **Choose the Route** — Observation vs embolization; transarterial vs translumbar.
6. **Novel Research** — Microbubble timing, CTA overlay, pressure probe.
7. **Protocol Build** — Sample size, IRB, data capture, outcome tracking.
8. **Payoff** — Successful case, poster with Dr. Erben, and future paper.

### Narrative Summary
- Act 1 (Panels 1-4): Dora-style explorer energy, characters set the mission and define Type 2 endoleak with arrows and sac diagrams.
- Act 2 (Panels 5-16): Clinical rigor—growth thresholds, CTA phases, source-vessel mapping, and approach decisions—delivered via speech bubbles.
- Act 3 (Panels 17-24): Research innovation beats—pressure probe, CEUS timing, protocol math, IRB and data discipline.
- Act 4 (Panels 25-32): Execution and payoff—ethics, data capture, results teaser, AR future, success follow-up, and journal submission.

## Visual & Prompt Notes
- Bright pastel backgrounds, bold outlines, playful arrows like a map.
- Speech bubbles carry all explanations; no side narration.
- Clear labels on sac growth thresholds, imaging phases, and vessels.
- Characters: Camilo (Colombia), Diego (Colombia), Camila (Ecuador), plus Dr. Young Erben cameo.
- Science anchors: retrograde collateral inflow, delayed blush, sac growth ≥5 mm trigger, embolization options, follow-up cadence.

## Narration Tone (compelling + scientific)
- Explorer energy (“¡Vamos!”) paired with precise thresholds and imaging phase names.
- Each research insight voiced in-character (no omniscient narrator).
- Humor via map arrows, stickers, and lightbulb “aha” beats; rigor via sac diameter numbers and CTA phase callouts.
- Bilingual touches (English/Spanish) to keep voice authentic to the characters.

## Files
- `storyboard.json` — authoritative panel data (titles, prompts, dialogue).
- `gpt-prompts.txt` — explicit prompts for GPT Image 1.5 (one per panel).
- `panels-gpt/` — GPT-generated panels from `.project/agents/image-generation/tools/gpt_image_generator.py`.
- `build_gpt_pdf.py` — assembles GPT panels into `type2-endoleak-comic-gpt.pdf` (6 panels/page).
- `comic-fluid.md` — fluid reading format embedding GPT panels.
- `generate_comic.py` / `panels/` — prior placeholder render path retained for fallback.
- `panel-map.json` — prompt → file map with alt text; maintain via `refresh_panel_map.py`.
