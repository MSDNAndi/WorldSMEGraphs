## Story Overview

Mr. Patel, a 62-year-old with diabetes, presents with a non-healing foot ulcer that's been there for 3 months. This case teaches diabetic arterial disease patterns, diagnostic workup, and limb salvage through microsurgical bypass.

### Patient Case
- **Patient**: Mr. Patel, 62 years old
- **Chief Complaint**: Non-healing wound on foot for 3 months
- **Diagnosis**: Diabetic foot ulcer with critical limb ischemia (ABI = 0.4)
- **Key Finding**: Patent dorsalis pedis artery as bypass target
- **Treatment**: Reversed vein fem-pedal bypass using saphenous vein

## Learning Objectives

1. **Diabetic Arterial Disease**
   - Preferential involvement of tibial and pedal vessels
   - Microvascular and macrovascular complications
   - Neuropathy + ischemia = dangerous combination
   - Why wounds don't heal without blood flow

2. **Ankle-Brachial Index (ABI)**
   - Normal: 1.0 (ankle pressure = arm pressure)
   - Mild PAD: 0.7-0.9
   - Moderate PAD: 0.4-0.7
   - Severe/Critical: <0.4 (Mr. Patel's value)
   - False elevation in diabetes (medial calcinosis)

3. **Angiography Roadmap**
   - Contrast dye visualization of arteries
   - Identifying blockages (marked in RED)
   - Finding patent target vessels (marked in GREEN)
   - Planning bypass route

4. **Distal Bypass Technique**
   - Autologous vein (saphenous) harvest
   - Reversed vs non-reversed technique
   - Microsurgical anastomosis (7-0 sutures)
   - Dorsalis pedis artery (2mm diameter)
   - Patch angioplasty considerations

5. **Healing Journey**
   - Immediate restoration of perfusion
   - Gradual wound healing over weeks
   - Importance of offloading and wound care
   - Long-term surveillance and prevention

6. **The Bypass Connection** - Microsurgical anastomosis to 2mm artery
7. **The Moment of Truth** - Releasing clamps, blood flows, Doppler signal!
8. **Healing Journey** - 6 weeks later, wound healed, patient walking

## Clinical Pearls

### Diabetic Foot Triad
1. **Neuropathy**: Loss of protective sensation → injury unnoticed
2. **Ischemia**: Poor blood flow → healing impaired
3. **Infection**: Common complication → tissue loss accelerated

### Target Vessel Selection
- **First choice**: Dorsalis pedis (if patent)
- **Second choice**: Posterior tibial
- **Third choice**: Peroneal
- **Last resort**: Plantar arteries

### Why Vein is Better Than Synthetic
- Better patency rates in small vessels
- Lower infection risk
- More compliant, natural
- Can use reversed or non-reversed technique

### Post-Op Care Critical Points
- Avoid pressure on wound (offloading)
- Glycemic control essential
- Infection prevention
- Regular vascular lab surveillance
- Aggressive risk factor modification

## Prevention Messages

For patients with diabetes:
- Daily foot inspections
- Proper footwear
- Control blood sugar
- Don't walk barefoot
- See doctor for ANY foot injury
- Regular podiatry visits
- Annual vascular screening
