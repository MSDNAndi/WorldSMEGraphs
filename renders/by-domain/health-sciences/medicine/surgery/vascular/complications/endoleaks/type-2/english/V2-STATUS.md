# Version 2 Development Status

## Completed Actions

### 1. Reply to User Comment ✅
- Acknowledged all requirements
- Confirmed understanding of character updates
- Committed to separated workflow approach
- Promised not to overwrite V1 content

### 2. Implementation Plan Created ✅
- Documented character update requirements for Dr. Erben
- Outlined separated workflow (Idea → Telling → Storyboard → Prompts → Images)
- Defined minimum 30 panels, story-driven expansion
- Established directory structure for V1/V2 coexistence
- File: `V2-IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md`

### 3. Character Specification ✅
**Dr. Erben V2**:
- Korean ethnicity
- Petite build (~5'2")
- 40s age range
- Expressive glasses (distinctive feature)
- Multilingual: Spanish (Venezuelan upbringing), English, German, Korean
- Cultural competence emphasis

## Work Required for Full Implementation

### Per Story (4 stories × 30+ panels each = 120+ images minimum)

**Phase 1: Story Idea** (~30 min per story)
- Core concept development
- Educational objectives
- Emotional arc planning
- Target length determination

**Phase 2: Story Telling** (~2-3 hours per story)
- Full narrative prose
- Complete dialogue
- Scene descriptions
- Character interactions
- Cultural elements integration

**Phase 3: Storyboard Development** (~2 hours per story)
- Panel-by-panel breakdown
- Visual composition specs
- Character positioning
- Medical accuracy review
- Educational content placement

**Phase 4: Prompt Generation** (~1 hour per story)
- Super-explicit prompts (10,000+ chars each)
- Dr. Erben character specifications
- Hex color codes
- Directional clarity
- Technical specifications

**Phase 5: Image Generation** (~2-3 hours per story)
- Generate 30+ images per story
- Parallel processing (8 concurrent)
- Quality validation
- Metadata preservation

**Phase 6: Documentation** (~1 hour per story)
- Story README
- Learning objectives
- Usage guidelines
- Integration with existing materials

**Total Estimated Time**: ~35-40 hours for all 4 stories

## Recommended Approach for Continuation

### Option A: Delegate to Specialized Agent
Recruit a storytelling or medical education agent with:
- Medical knowledge
- Narrative development skills
- Cultural competence understanding
- Image generation expertise

### Option B: Phased Implementation
Complete one story fully as template:
1. Carotid V2 (most complex, 35+ panels)
2. Use as template for other 3 stories
3. Ensure consistency across all

### Option C: Collaborative Development
1. Human develops detailed narratives
2. AI generates storyboards from narratives
3. AI creates prompts and generates images
4. Human reviews for medical accuracy

## What's Ready Now

### Files Created
- ✅ `V2-IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md` - Complete implementation guide
- ✅ `STATUS.md` (this file) - Current state documentation

### Directory Structure
```
renders/.../endoleaks/type-2/english/
├── V2-IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md ✅
├── STATUS.md ✅
├── carotid-artery-stenosis/ (V1 - preserved) ✅
├── acute-limb-ischemia/ (V1 - preserved) ✅
├── diabetic-foot-bypass/ (V1 - preserved) ✅
├── varicose-veins/ (V1 - preserved) ✅
└── (V2 directories ready to create)
```

### V1 Content Status
✅ **All V1 content preserved and unchanged**:
- 56 original images intact
- All original documentation intact
- No files overwritten or modified

## Next Session Recommendations

### Priority 1: Complete Carotid V2
Full workflow demonstration:
1. Create detailed story idea (~500 words)
2. Write complete narrative (~5000-7000 words, 35 panels)
3. Develop detailed storyboard JSON
4. Generate super-explicit prompts
5. Generate all 35 images
6. Create comprehensive documentation

### Priority 2: Template Other Stories
Once carotid V2 complete, use as template:
- Copy structure
- Adapt medical content
- Maintain Dr. Erben characterization
- Ensure 30+ panels each

### Priority 3: Integration Documentation
- Overview of V1 vs V2
- Character comparison guide
- Workflow benefits analysis
- Educational applications

## Technical Considerations

### Image Generation Capacity
- Current session generated 56 images successfully
- V2 requires 120+ images minimum (4 stories × 30)
- Recommend breaking into multiple sessions
- Use parallel processing (8 concurrent optimal)

### Character Consistency
Must specify in every prompt:
```
Dr. Erben: Petite Korean woman in her 40s, 
wearing expressive glasses (slightly oversized frames), 
dark shoulder-length hair in professional style,
navy blue scrubs with white coat,
confident but approachable demeanor,
approximately 5'2" height,
standing on step stool for surgical procedures
```

### Quality Assurance
- Medical accuracy review required
- Cultural sensitivity review required
- Language usage authenticity check
- Visual consistency across all panels

## Session Constraints

**Current Session**:
- Started at: 20:31 UTC
- Must complete by: ~21:21 UTC (50-minute rule)
- Status: In progress (~15 minutes elapsed)
- Remaining: ~35 minutes

**Realistic Current Session Goal**:
✅ Implementation plan and status documentation
⬜ Begin carotid V2 story idea (time permitting)
⬜ Defer full implementation to next session(s)

## Summary

**Completed**:
- User comment acknowledged and replied to
- Implementation plan comprehensive and documented
- V1 content fully preserved
- Framework established for V2 development
- Character specifications clear and detailed

**Requires Continuation**:
- Full narrative development for all 4 stories
- Storyboard creation for 120+ panels total
- Super-explicit prompt generation
- Image generation and validation
- Documentation and integration

**Estimated Total Work**: 35-40 hours across multiple sessions

This is a substantial expansion project that will deliver significantly more elaborate and culturally rich educational content with the updated Dr. Erben character.
