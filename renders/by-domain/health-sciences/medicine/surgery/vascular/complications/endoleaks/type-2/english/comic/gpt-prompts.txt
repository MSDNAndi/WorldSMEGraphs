Panel 11 - Intervention path: Red flowchart sac growth → embolization; catheter icon. Speech: Camilo "If it grows over 5 mm, we intervene." Camila "Choose route: transarterial or translumbar." Apply STYLE BASE; map arrows.
Panel 12 - Transarterial route: Microcatheter threading into lumbar artery toward sac; coils ready. Speech: Diego "Microcatheter 2.0F through lumbar branch." Camilo "Coils first; glue if flow persists." Apply STYLE BASE; show hand holding catheter.
Panel 13 - Translumbar route: Needle from back into sac under CT guidance with spine backdrop. Speech: Camila "Direct route when arteries are tortuous." Diego "CT guidance keeps us off the nerve root." Apply STYLE BASE; include safety shield.
Panel 14 - Novel idea spark: 3D sac model on table, glowing lightbulb, laptops open. Speech: Camilo "What if we time persistent microbubbles?" Camila "We measure blush duration." Apply STYLE BASE; sticky note "pilot idea".
Panel 15 - Microbubble tracker: CEUS screen with swirling bright bubbles and timer overlay. Speech: Diego "We track wash-in and wash-out seconds." Camilo "Persistence over 60 seconds flags risk." Apply STYLE BASE; timer visible.
Panel 16 - Dual-phase CTA overlay: Tablet slider merging arterial and delayed frames with colored overlay. Speech: Camila "Fuse phases to pinpoint inflow." Diego "Aim the microcatheter precisely." Apply STYLE BASE; overlay legend.
Panel 17 - Pressure monitoring: Sac diagram with pressure gauge dropping after test. Speech: Camilo "Pressure probe inside sac." Camila "Drop means we sealed the inflow." Apply STYLE BASE; gauge label mmHg.
Panel 18 - Outcome data wall: Poster with success 70–80%, recurrence 10–20%, chart arrows. Speech: Diego "Selective embolization succeeds 70–80%." Camilo "Recurrence 10–20%; keep surveillance." Apply STYLE BASE; clear numerals.
Panel 19 - Patient talk: Counseling room, anatomical model on table. Speech: Camila "Not a stent seal leak—small branches feed it." Diego "Plan: watch; if growth, seal with coils or glue." Apply STYLE BASE; patient listening, calm tone.
Panel 20 - Sterile prep: Cath lab cartoon with blue drapes, checklist floating. Speech: Camilo "Checklist: anticoagulation, access, microcatheter." Camila "Keep fluoroscopy dose low." Apply STYLE BASE; drapes and monitor.
Panel 21 - Coil deployment: Inside sac view with coils spiraling, flow stops, sparkles. Speech: Diego "Coils until stasis; Onyx if slow trickle remains." Camilo "Final angiogram to confirm." Apply STYLE BASE; consistent gloves/gear.
Panel 22 - Post-procedure CTA: CTA slice without blush, green check. Speech: Camila "CTA at 6–12 weeks shows no blush." Diego "Diameter stable or smaller." Apply STYLE BASE; clear green check.
Panel 23 - Pilot study draft: Poster with bullets: CEUS persistence, sac pressure probe, overlay tool. Speech: Camilo "Hypothesis: bubble over 60s predicts expansion." Camila "Test in 20 consecutive patients." Apply STYLE BASE; clipboards.
Panel 24 - Sample size debate: Table with calculator, coffee cups, charts. Speech: Diego "Power 80%, alpha 0.05 needs 34 cases." Camilo "Add buffer for dropouts." Apply STYLE BASE; consistent outfits.
Panel 25 - Ethics reminder: IRB consent form with heart icon. Speech: Camila "Consent must be clear and plain English." Diego "Low risk, potential benefit." Apply STYLE BASE; no bilingual text.
Panel 26 - Data capture: Laptop with sac diameter chart, cloud/REDCap icon. Speech: Camilo "Capture diameter, blush time, pressure." Camila "REDCap triggers alerts." Apply STYLE BASE; same character faces.
Panel 27 - Result teaser: Poster comparing growth vs stable lines, bubbles labeled fast vs slow wash-out. Speech: Diego "If slow wash-out correlates, we change the algorithm." Camilo "Intervene earlier in high risk." Apply STYLE BASE; chart arrows.
Panel 28 - Teaching moment: Whiteboard bullets “locate, measure, choose route” all in English. Speech: Camila "Three steps: locate, measure, route." Diego "Always check the delayed phase." Apply STYLE BASE; explorer stickers.
Panel 29 - Future tech dream: Augmented reality tablet projecting holographic artery over abdomen. Speech: Camilo "Dream: AR shows the culprit artery." Camila "Guides the microcatheter like GPS." Apply STYLE BASE; keep outfits same.
Panel 30 - Wrap-up with Dr. Erben: Conference room, poster presentation. Speech: Dr. Erben "Clear, visual science wins." Diego "Ready to enroll and publish." Apply STYLE BASE; consistent models.
Panel 31 - Patient success: Follow-up visit, happy patient with cane, sac diagram shrinking. Speech: Camila "Sac 5 mm smaller, no blush." Camilo "Annual follow-up set." Apply STYLE BASE; hospital room.
