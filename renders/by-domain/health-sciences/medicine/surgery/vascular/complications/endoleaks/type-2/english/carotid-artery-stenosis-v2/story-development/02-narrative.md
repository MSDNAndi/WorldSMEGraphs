# The Silent Warning: Dr. Erben's Carotid Stenosis Story

## Full Narrative (30-40 panels)

### ACT 1: THE WARNING SIGNS (Panels 1-12)

**Panel 1: Emergency Room Arrival**

The automatic doors of St. Maria Hospital's emergency department slid open at 2:47 PM on a humid Tuesday afternoon. Carmen Rodriguez, a 67-year-old woman, walked in slowly, supported on either side by her adult daughter Maria and son-in-law Jorge. Carmen's face showed traces of concern mixed with embarrassment—she insisted she was "probably overreacting," but her family had learned not to ignore sudden health changes.

Dr. Yuna Erben was finishing notes on another patient when she heard the triage nurse call out in Spanish: "Posible ACV, sala tres" (Possible stroke, room three). Yuna's head snapped up instantly. The Korean-American surgeon, barely five feet tall but commanding every inch, adjusted her distinctive rectangular glasses and moved purposefully toward the room. Her teal scrubs, slightly too long for her petite frame, swished as she walked with practiced urgency.

**Panel 2: Building Trust Through Language**

"Buenas tardes, Señora Rodriguez. Soy la Doctora Erben," Yuna said warmly as she entered the room, her Spanish carrying the soft Venezuelan accent she'd absorbed during her childhood in Caracas. Carmen's eyes widened with relief—a doctor who spoke her language.

"Doctora, I told my daughter I'm fine, but—" Carmen began.

"Tell me everything, from the beginning," Yuna interrupted gently, pulling up a stool to sit at eye level with her patient. "No detail is too small."

Carmen explained: Two hours ago, while preparing lunch, her right hand had suddenly felt "strange"—not exactly numb, but weak and clumsy. She'd dropped a pot. Then her daughter's face had looked blurry on the right side. When she tried to call out, her words came out slurred, like she'd had too much wine. "But Doctora, it only lasted maybe ten minutes. Now I feel normal. See?" She raised both arms, demonstrating full strength.

Yuna's expression remained calm, but internally alarm bells rang. Classic TIA—transient ischemic attack. The brain's warning shot before a major stroke.

**Panel 3: The Physical Examination**

"Señora Rodriguez, you did exactly the right thing by coming in," Yuna said firmly. "What you experienced is called a TIA, a mini-stroke. It's your brain telling us there's a problem we need to fix before something worse happens."

She began her systematic neurological examination. Cranial nerves: intact. Motor strength: full in all extremities now. Sensation: normal. Coordination: good. But then, as Yuna pressed her stethoscope to Carmen's neck just below the angle of the jaw, she heard it—a harsh, whooshing sound over the right carotid artery. A bruit. The audible turbulence of blood forcing its way through a narrowed, plaque-filled vessel.

"I hear something I need to investigate further," Yuna explained, sketching a simple diagram on the exam room's whiteboard. "This is your carotid artery—it brings blood from your heart to your brain. When it gets narrowed by cholesterol buildup, it can cause exactly what you experienced."

**Panel 4: FAST Assessment Education**

Yuna pulled out her tablet and opened a patient education video, switching it to Spanish. "I want to teach you and your family something called 'FAST.' It's how we recognize strokes quickly."

She demonstrated with Maria as her volunteer:

"**F - Face:** Ask the person to smile. Does one side droop?" Maria smiled normally.

"**A - Arms:** Raise both arms. Does one drift downward?" Both arms stayed up.

"**S - Speech:** Have them repeat a simple phrase. Is it slurred?" Maria said "el cielo es azul" perfectly.

"**T - Time:** If you see ANY of these signs, call 911 immediately. Time is brain—every minute counts."

Jorge took notes on his phone. "So when mamá had the droopy speech and weak hand..."

"Exactly," Yuna confirmed. "You did perfectly. Now we prevent it from happening again."

**Panel 5: Understanding the Enemy - TIA Education**

Using her tablet's drawing app, Yuna illustrated the pathophysiology in terms Carmen could understand. She drew a water pipe with sediment building up on the walls.

"Think of your carotid artery like this pipe," Yuna explained in Spanish. "Over years, cholesterol, calcium, and inflammatory cells build up—we call it plaque. The pipe gets narrower." She shaded the pipe's interior, leaving only a small channel.

"When a tiny piece breaks off—" she flicked a dot from the plaque "—it travels to your brain and blocks a small vessel. That's what caused your symptoms. The good news: it was temporary. The bad news: you're at high risk for a major stroke if we don't address the narrowing."

Carmen's daughter squeezed her mother's hand. "What do we need to do, Doctora?"

**Panel 6: Diagnostic Imaging - Carotid Duplex**

Within an hour, Carmen was in the vascular lab for a carotid duplex ultrasound. The ultrasound technologist, a friendly woman named Sandra, applied warm gel to Carmen's neck.

"This test uses sound waves to see inside your blood vessels," Yuna explained, standing beside the machine. "No radiation, no needles—completely safe."

On the monitor, the right common carotid artery appeared as a dark channel. But at the bifurcation where it split into internal and external branches, a gray, irregular mass protruded into the lumen. The Doppler showed velocities shooting to over 300 cm/second—far above the normal 60-80 range.

"Severe stenosis," Sandra murmured to Yuna. "At least 80-85% by velocity criteria."

Yuna nodded grimly. NASCET criteria confirmed what she'd suspected: this was surgical territory.

**Panel 7: The Ultrasound Results**

After the study, Yuna brought the images up on the exam room computer, rotating the screen so Carmen and her family could see clearly.

"Señora Rodriguez, here's what we found." She pointed to the narrowing. "See how the artery should be this wide—" she indicated the normal segment "—but here at the branch point, it's squeezed to maybe 15% of its normal size. The blood has to rush through at very high speed, and pieces of this plaque—" she circled the irregular gray mass "—can break off at any time."

"How bad is it?" Carmen asked quietly.

"It's severe. You have 85% stenosis. That puts you at about 15-20% risk of having a major stroke within the next two years if we don't fix it. But if we remove this plaque surgically, we can reduce that risk to less than 2%."

**Panel 8: CT Angiography - Detailed Mapping**

"I want one more test to plan the best approach," Yuna explained. "A CT angiogram will give me a 3D map of your arteries—it helps me see exactly where the plaque is, how long it extends, and plan the safest surgery."

Thirty minutes later, Carmen emerged from the CT scanner. Yuna loaded the images on her workstation, manipulating the 3D reconstruction with practiced expertise. The right internal carotid showed a 2.5 cm long plaque beginning just above the bifurcation. The plaque was heterogeneous—dark areas suggesting lipid-rich, vulnerable material likely to embolize. The external carotid was relatively spared. Perfect anatomy for endarterectomy.

"Can we see it?" Maria asked, peeking at the screen.

Yuna rotated the image to show the family. "Look—here's the narrowing in 3D. This is what I'll be removing. The blood vessel continues up to your brain—see? Once we clean this out, blood flow will return to normal."

**Panel 9: Neurology Consultation**

Dr. James Park, the stroke neurologist, joined Yuna at the multidisciplinary board meeting that evening. On the conference room screen, Carmen's images displayed alongside her clinical history.

"Symptomatic 85% stenosis, NASCET criteria easily met," James summarized. "She's on aspirin now, we've started a high-intensity statin. Blood pressure is controlled. But given the symptom yesterday—"

"She's high risk," Yuna finished. "NASCET trial data shows we need to operate sooner rather than later in symptomatic patients. Her two-year stroke risk is 26% medically managed versus 9% with surgery."

"When can you take her?" James asked.

"Day after tomorrow if her cardiac clearance comes back okay. We'll keep her on telemetry monitoring until then—I don't want her having a major stroke while waiting for surgery."

James nodded. "I'll follow her postoperatively. Any concerns about her as a candidate?"

Yuna pulled up Carmen's labs and EKG. "She's actually pretty healthy otherwise. Never smoked, diabetes well-controlled on metformin, no prior cardiac history. Normal renal function. She's an ideal candidate."

**Panel 10: Family Meeting - Visual Education**

The next morning, Yuna invited Carmen and her entire family to the consultation room. On the table sat an anatomical model of the carotid arteries, complete with a removable plaque section.

"I want everyone to understand exactly what we're going to do," Yuna began, picking up the model. "This is a model of your neck's blood vessels. The red ones carry oxygen-rich blood from your heart to your brain."

She pointed to the carotid bifurcation. "This fork here—this is where the common carotid splits into two branches. The internal branch goes to your brain. The external branch goes to your face and scalp."

Using the model, she showed how plaque accumulates at the bifurcation point due to turbulent flow. "Your plaque is right here. During surgery, I'll make a small incision in your neck—about this long—" she indicated 8-10 centimeters on the model's neck "—expose this artery, open it carefully, and remove the entire plaque. Then I'll close it with a patch to make it even wider than before."

Carmen's grandson, a nursing student, asked, "What if plaque breaks off during surgery?"

"Excellent question," Yuna replied. "Before I open the artery, I place soft clamps here and here—" she demonstrated with her fingers on the model "—completely stopping flow through this segment. That way nothing can float up to your brain during the cleaning. Your brain gets blood from the other carotid artery on the left side during those few minutes."

**Panel 11: Treatment Options Discussion**

"Señora Rodriguez," Yuna said, sitting back down and removing her glasses to clean them—a habit when discussing serious topics. "I want you to understand you have choices. Surgery isn't the only option."

She pulled up a comparison chart on the tablet:

**Medical Management:**
- Aspirin + statin medications
- Blood pressure control
- Diet and exercise
- Regular monitoring with ultrasound
- 2-year stroke risk: ~26%

**Carotid Endarterectomy (Surgery):**
- Remove plaque completely
- General anesthesia, 2-3 hour procedure
- Hospital stay 1-2 nights
- Surgical risk: 3% stroke/death
- 2-year stroke risk after surgery: ~9%

**Carotid Stenting:**
- Less invasive than surgery
- Mesh tube props artery open
- Higher risk of small emboli during procedure
- Generally reserved for patients too high-risk for surgery
- You're healthy enough for surgery, so I recommend endarterectomy

"The NASCET and ECST trials show clearly that for patients like you—symptoms from severe stenosis—surgery is superior to medications alone," Yuna explained. "We've been doing this operation for 60 years. It's one of the most proven stroke prevention procedures we have."

**Panel 12: Shared Decision Making**

"What would you do if this were your mother?" Carmen asked directly.

Yuna smiled softly. "My eomma—my mother in Korean—is 69, just two years older than you. If she had symptomatic 85% stenosis like yours, I would beg her to have the surgery. The numbers are clear. Your risk of stroke without surgery is much higher than the small risk from the operation itself."

She leaned forward. "But this is your decision, Señora Rodriguez. I'll support whatever you choose. We can manage you medically if you prefer. We can take more time to think. There's no pressure."

Carmen looked at her daughter, then back at Yuna. "You grew up in Venezuela, Doctora?"

"Yes, in Caracas, until I was 15. Then my family moved to California."

"Then you understand—family is everything. I want to see my grandchildren grow up, finish school, get married. If this surgery gives me the best chance..." She took a deep breath. "Let's do it."

Yuna clasped Carmen's hand. "Then we'll take excellent care of you. I promise."

### ACT 2: SURGICAL PREPARATION (Panels 13-20)

**Panel 13: Preoperative Assessment**

Dr. Lisa Chen, the cardiology consultant, listened to Carmen's heart through her stethoscope and reviewed the EKG printout. "Normal sinus rhythm, no murmurs, good peripheral pulses. Your echocardiogram shows excellent heart function—55% ejection fraction." She looked up at Yuna. "She's cleared for surgery from a cardiac standpoint."

The preoperative labs came back equally reassuring:
- Hemoglobin: 13.2 (good oxygen-carrying capacity)
- Platelet count: 245,000 (normal clotting)
- Creatinine: 0.9 (healthy kidneys)
- INR: 1.0 (stopped aspirin 3 days prior per protocol)

"Everything looks perfect," Yuna told Carmen during evening rounds. "Surgery is scheduled for tomorrow at 7:30 AM. You'll be first case—that way I'm fresh and you don't have to wait around nervous all day."

Carmen managed a nervous laugh. "Is that doctor humor?"

"Maybe a little. But also true."

**Panel 14: Surgical Planning Session**

Late that evening, Yuna sat in the surgical planning room, a cup of chamomile tea growing cold beside her laptop. The three large monitors displayed Carmen's imaging from every angle: axial CT slices, 3D reconstructions, ultrasound clips, and the angiogram.

She traced the internal carotid with her finger on the screen. The plaque started 8mm above the bifurcation and extended 25mm superiorly. She'd need to expose at least 1cm above and below the plaque for safe clamping. The external carotid looked clean—she could use it as an outflow during shunt placement if needed.

Yuna opened her surgical notes template and began typing:

*Procedure: Right carotid endarterectomy with patch angioplasty*

*Approach: Longitudinal incision along anterior border of sternocleidomastoid*

*Key steps:*
*1. Expose carotid bifurcation with careful preservation of cranial nerves...*

She documented every step she'd take, every potential complication, every contingency plan. Korean perfectionism from her mother mixed with Latin American warmth from her Venezuelan upbringing—a powerful combination that made her one of the hospital's most sought-after surgeons.

**Panel 15: Anesthesia Consultation**

"Good morning, Mrs. Rodriguez. I'm Dr. Kevin O'Brien, I'll be your anesthesiologist tomorrow." The tall Irishman sat down and opened his tablet. "Dr. Erben asked me to chat with you about how we'll keep you safe during surgery."

"Will I be asleep?" Carmen asked.

"Completely. You'll have general anesthesia—you won't feel or remember anything. But here's what makes carotid surgery special: we use something called neuromonitoring." He showed her a diagram. "We'll place small electrodes on your scalp—like an EEG—that constantly measure your brain's electrical activity. If your brain doesn't like having the carotid clamped for any reason, we'll see it immediately and Dr. Erben will place a temporary shunt to maintain blood flow."

"Has that ever happened?"

"In about 5-10% of cases, we use a shunt as a precaution. Think of it as a temporary bypass tube inside your artery, ensuring blood keeps flowing to your brain while Dr. Erben cleans out the plaque. It's completely routine."

Dr. O'Brien continued explaining the anesthetic plan: induced with propofol, maintained with sevoflurane, blood pressure carefully controlled between 140-160 systolic throughout the procedure—high enough to perfuse the brain through collaterals, not so high as to risk bleeding.

**Panel 16: Patient Education with Models**

Yuna returned after lunch with her tackle box of teaching supplies. She pulled out a clear plastic model of a carotid artery, complete with a nasty-looking yellow plaque inside.

"I want you to touch this," Yuna said, handing it to Carmen. "Feel how hard and irregular it is? That's calcified plaque—the bad cholesterol mixed with calcium and inflammatory cells. This is what's in your artery."

She then showed a clean, smooth plastic artery. "This is what your artery will look like after surgery. Blood will flow freely, no more turbulence, no more risk of pieces breaking off."

Using a third model with an opening zipper, Yuna demonstrated the arteriotomy. "I'll make an opening along this line, peel out the plaque carefully—it actually comes out in one piece, like an orange peel—and then sew it closed with this." She held up a tiny oval patch. "This is bovine pericardium, cow heart lining. It's been treated to be compatible with your body and gives us a wider lumen than just sewing the artery closed directly."

Carmen's grandson took photos of each model with his phone, creating a study guide.

**Panel 17: Informed Consent**

The formal consent process took place in Carmen's room with Maria present and a certified Spanish interpreter on video link—hospital policy required a certified interpreter even though Yuna spoke Spanish fluently, to ensure nothing was missed.

Yuna went through each risk systematically:

"**Stroke:** 2-3% risk during or after surgery. This is the most serious risk."

"**Death:** Less than 1% in elective surgery like yours."

"**Nerve injury:** 5-7% risk of temporary hoarseness or tongue weakness from nerves near the artery. Usually recovers completely."

"**Bleeding:** We might need to go back to the OR if you develop a hematoma—less than 2% risk."

"**Heart attack:** Very rare with your healthy heart, but we monitor closely."

"**Infection:** Less than 1% with antibiotics."

"¿Entiende todos estos riesgos?" (Do you understand all these risks?) Yuna asked.

"Sí, Doctora. Los entiendo," Carmen replied firmly. She signed the consent form.

**Panel 18: Night Before - Dr. Erben's Preparation**

At 10:47 PM, Yuna sat at her kitchen table in her small apartment, reviewing Carmen's case one final time. Her cat, a rescue tabby named Seoul, purred on her lap as she mentally walked through every step of tomorrow's surgery.

She pulled out her surgical atlas—a worn copy of "Rutherford's Vascular Surgery" that had belonged to her mentor—and reviewed the anatomy plates of the carotid bifurcation. Hypoglossal nerve: runs between internal and external carotids, preserve carefully. Vagus nerve: lies posterior in carotid sheath, don't injure with retractors. Ansa cervicalis: often sacrificed, but preserve if possible.

Her phone buzzed: a text from her brother in Seoul, Korea. "언니, 수술 잘 되길 바래요" (Unnie/older sister, hope surgery goes well). He remembered she had a big case tomorrow. She smiled and texted back a heart emoji.

At 11:15, she climbed into bed but sleep came slowly. It always did before carotid cases. Too much could go wrong. But she'd done 237 carotid endarterectomies in her career with only 2 strokes and zero deaths. Tonight would be number 238.

**Panel 19: Morning of Surgery**

5:30 AM. Yuna's alarm chimed—a gentle Korean melody. She went through her morning routine: shower, protein shake, review Carmen's labs one more time on her phone. Dress in comfortable clothes for the drive—she'd change into scrubs at the hospital.

6:15 AM. At the hospital, Yuna scrubbed off her makeup (she learned early in residency that mascara running under a surgical loupes is both uncomfortable and unprofessional), tied her hair in a tight ponytail, and changed into her teal scrubs. She pinned her ID badge carefully and hung her stethoscope around her neck.

In the preoperative area, Carmen sat in a recliner wearing a surgical gown, her family around her. An IV ran into her left arm delivering fluids.

"Buenos días, Señora Rodriguez. Ready?" Yuna asked gently.

"Lista, Doctora." (Ready, Doctor.)

Yuna squeezed her shoulder. "I'll take good care of you. See you in a few hours."

**Panel 20: Scrubbing In**

6:55 AM. Yuna stood at the scrub sink outside OR 4, the large surgical suite reserved for vascular cases. She turned on the water with her knee, picked up the sterile brush, and began the methodical process: nails first, 10 strokes each finger, then the fingers themselves, palms, back of hands, wrists, forearms. Two minutes per arm. The ritual soothed her pre-operative anxiety.

Through the OR window, she could see the anesthesia team positioning Carmen on the operating table, placing the neuromonitoring electrodes, starting the anesthetic. The OR nurse, Tammy, arranged instruments on the sterile field: mosquito clamps, right-angle forceps, Potts scissors, 6-0 Prolene sutures, the patch material.

Yuna's eyes met Tammy's through the window. Tammy gave a thumbs up—everything ready.

Drying her hands on a sterile towel without touching anything, Yuna backed through the OR doors. The scrub tech helped her into her surgical gown, tied it snugly, then held out size 6.5 gloves. Yuna slid her small hands in and snapped the latex tight.

"Let's do this," she said quietly.

### ACT 3: THE SURGERY (Panels 21-32)

**Panel 21: Operating Room Setup**

The OR resembled a highly choreographed dance. Carmen lay supine on the table, a shoulder roll elevating her right side slightly, head turned to the left exposing her neck. A Foley catheter drained her bladder. The arterial line in her wrist showed real-time blood pressure: 152/84—perfect.

Yuna approached the table, her petite frame making her need a step stool—something she never minded, having long since abandoned any self-consciousness about her height. "Tammy, I'll need the step stool positioned here," she indicated, "so I can reach comfortably without straining my back."

"Already here, Dr. Erben," Tammy replied with a smile.

The scrub tech laid out instruments in precise order: first the incision set, then exposure instruments, then arteriotomy instruments, then the delicate tools for plaque removal, finally closure instruments.

"Timeout," called Dr. O'Brien from the head of the table. Everyone stopped and focused.

"Patient: Carmen Rodriguez, date of birth March 15, 1957."
"Procedure: Right carotid endarterectomy."
"Site: Right neck—marked by surgeon."
"Antibiotics: Ancef given. Allergies: none."
"Neuromonitoring: Active, baseline established."
"Special equipment: Shunt available, patch on table."
"Any concerns? No? Okay, team. Be safe."

Yuna picked up the skin marker and drew her incision line along the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, from the mastoid process down toward the clavicle. About 10 centimeters—not too long, not too short.

**Panel 22: Incision and Initial Exposure**

"Scalpel," Yuna requested, her voice calm and measured.

The blade touched skin at the superior aspect of her marked line. With one smooth, confident stroke, she incised through skin and subcutaneous tissue. The yellow fat beneath welled up slightly.

"Bovie." The electrocautery device crackled as Yuna coagulated small bleeding vessels. The smell of singed tissue—metallic and organic—filled the air. New residents often felt queasy at this smell; Yuna had long since associated it with healing.

She divided the platysma muscle, exposing the deeper fascia. "Retractors."

Her assistant, Dr. Rodriguez (no relation to the patient, a vascular surgery fellow), placed self-retaining retractors to hold back the skin edges. The operative field deepened.

"This part requires patience," Yuna murmured, more to herself than anyone else. "The carotid is surrounded by important nerves. Rush and you injure the vagus—patient has hoarse voice forever. Rush and you damage the hypoglossal—tongue deviates, swallowing problems. Slow and steady."

**Panel 23: Dissecting to the Carotid Bifurcation**

Yuna identified the internal jugular vein, large and blue, running parallel to where the carotid should be. She gently retracted it laterally.

"There," she said, pointing with her forceps. The carotid artery pulsed beneath a layer of fascia, red-pink and smooth. "That's the common carotid."

She incised the overlying fascia carefully, the vessel coming into full view. Using blunt dissection—spreading with her forceps rather than cutting—she separated the artery from surrounding tissues.

"Follow it up to the bifurcation," she narrated for her fellow. "See how it splits here into internal and external branches? The internal has no branches initially—goes straight to the brain. The external gives off the superior thyroid artery here—see it?"

The bifurcation emerged into view. The plaque was visible externally—a bulge in the otherwise smooth vessel, firm and irregular under her gloved finger.

**Panel 24: Isolating the Arteries**

With meticulous technique, Yuna passed vessel loops around each artery segment: common carotid below the plaque, external carotid at the origin, internal carotid well above the plaque.

"This is critical," she explained. "These loops let me control the vessel without traumatic clamping. When I'm ready, I'll pull them tight and place the clamps."

She identified the hypoglossal nerve crossing above the bifurcation—a thin white strand. "See this? That controls tongue movement. We preserve it." She gently retracted it superiorly with a soft rubber sling.

The vagus nerve lay deeper in the carotid sheath. "This one we don't even look for directly—just gentle handling of tissues."

**Panel 25: Systemic Heparinization**

"Ready for heparin," Yuna announced.

The anesthesiologist drew up 5,000 units of heparin and injected it into Carmen's IV. "Heparin in at 7:48. We'll check ACT in three minutes."

"While we wait," Yuna said, "I'm going to continue dissection distally on the internal carotid. I need good exposure well above the plaque."

She worked steadily, her magnifying loupes giving her 2.5x magnification of the operative field. Each tiny perforating vessel was coagulated carefully before division.

"ACT is 287 seconds," Dr. O'Brien reported. "Good to clamp."

"Perfect. Okay team, the next few minutes are critical. Neuromonitoring stays vigilant. If the EEG shows any changes, you call it out immediately."

**Panel 26: Clamping and Arteriotomy**

Yuna placed the first clamp on the common carotid artery—a smooth, atraumatic DeBakey clamp that closed without crushing. Blood flow from the heart stopped instantly.

"Internal carotid clamp." Click. Blood flow to the brain from this vessel ceased.

"External carotid clamp." Click. Now the entire bifurcation segment was isolated.

"Time of clamp: 7:52 AM," the circulating nurse recorded.

"Neuromonitoring stable," Dr. O'Brien reported. "No EEG changes. Good collateral flow from the left carotid and vertebrals."

Yuna exhaled quietly. Good. No shunt needed.

She picked up Potts scissors—delicate angled scissors designed for arteriotomies. Starting on the common carotid below the plaque, she made a longitudinal incision through the arterial wall. The scissors cut cleanly through the tough, muscular vessel. She extended the incision up across the plaque and onto the internal carotid above it.

The artery lay open, exposing the inner lumen. Yuna's headlight illuminated the interior. There, adhering to the arterial wall like a grotesque second skin, sat the atherosclerotic plaque—irregular, yellow-white, with areas of chalky calcification.

**Panel 27: Visualizing the Plaque**

"Take a look," Yuna invited her fellow, who leaned in with his own loupes.

The plaque was ugly. Decades of accumulated cholesterol, infiltrated with inflammatory cells, calcified in places, ulcerated in others. At the ulcerations, the soft lipid core was exposed—the "vulnerable plaque" that spawned emboli.

"This is what caused her TIA," Yuna said. "See these ulcerations? Platelets stick here, form little clots, break off, shoot up to the brain. We're removing the threat."

She tested the plane between plaque and arterial wall with a small spatula. In a perfect endarterectomy, the plaque should separate cleanly in the correct anatomical plane—between the diseased intima and the healthy media.

"Good plane," she murmured with satisfaction. "This should come out nicely."

**Panel 28: Beginning Endarterectomy**

Using a combination of sharp and blunt dissection, Yuna began developing the plane around the plaque. She worked circumferentially, staying in the correct tissue layer. Too superficial and she'd perforate the artery. Too deep and she'd leave plaque behind.

The plaque started to separate. At the proximal (common carotid) end, she transected it sharply with scissors, leaving a smooth edge.

"Now the critical part," she said. "The plaque has to feather off distally, in the internal carotid. If it ends abruptly, that edge can lift up later and cause acute occlusion."

She worked the plaque up into the internal carotid, using gentle spatulation and irrigation to visualize the distal endpoint. There—the plaque tapered gradually to nothing, creating a smooth transition back to normal artery.

"Perfect feather," she announced with satisfaction. "This should heal beautifully."

**Panel 29: Removing the Plaque Specimen**

With a final careful manipulation, the entire plaque came free—a yellowish, rubbery cast of the arterial interior, about 2.5cm long, irregular and lobulated.

"Specimen to pathology," Yuna said, placing it in a sterile container. "They'll examine it, confirm it's atherosclerotic plaque, look for any unexpected findings."

She inspected the endarterectomy bed—the inner arterial surface left behind. It should be smooth, glistening, with no loose flaps or fragments. She irrigated with heparinized saline, washing away any small debris.

"See how smooth this is?" she showed her fellow. "This is the media layer—the middle muscular layer of the artery. All the diseased intima is gone. It's like we've given her a new artery."

**Panel 30: Inspecting the Endarterectomy Bed**

Yuna meticulously inspected every millimeter of the endarterectomy bed. With her forceps, she tested for any loose intimal fragments that might lift later.

"Here—see this small edge?" She pointed to a tiny flap at the distal endpoint. "This needs to be tacked down or it'll cause trouble." She took a 7-0 Prolene suture—thinner than a human hair—and placed a single tack stitch, securing the edge.

She continued her inspection. The transition from endarterectomized surface to normal intima was smooth. No calcified chunks remained. The media layer showed no injury.

"Irrigate again," she requested. The assistant flushed the lumen with saline.

"Looks perfect," Yuna concluded. "Now we close with a patch."

**Panel 31: Patch Angioplasty Closure**

Tammy handed Yuna the patch—an oval of treated bovine pericardium, about 1cm wide and 3cm long.

"Why a patch?" the medical student observer asked.

"Good question," Yuna replied while examining the patch for any defects. "If I just sew the artery closed directly, primary closure, it narrows the lumen. Studies show patch closure—" she held up the patch "—reduces re-stenosis rates from about 15% down to 3-4%. Wider lumen, better long-term results."

She began suturing at the superior (distal) apex of the arteriotomy. Using 6-0 Prolene continuous suture, she sewed with tiny, precise bites, spacing them evenly 1-2mm apart.

The suturing had to be perfect: too loose and it would leak; too tight and the vessel would pucker. She maintained just the right tension, the suture line clean and regular.

Down one side of the patch, around the inferior apex, up the other side. Her hands moved with practiced efficiency. In her mind, Korean precision guided every stitch.

**Panel 32: Final Closure and Declamping**

The suture line complete, Yuna tied the final knot and cut the suture. She inspected her work: the patch incorporated smoothly into the vessel, creating a gentle fusiform widening at the bifurcation.

"Ready to declamp. Sequence will be: external first, then internal briefly to flush any air or debris, then common."

She released the external carotid clamp. Blood rushed in, filling the endarterectomy bed and patches. No leaks—the suture line held perfectly.

"Internal carotid briefly—" She released it momentarily, letting blood flush through, then reclamped. Any air bubbles or small debris washed out into the external carotid territory (supplying the face, not the brain).

"Common carotid clamp off." She removed the final clamp.

Blood flow restored. The patch pulsed gently with each heartbeat. The entire bifurcation looked pink and healthy.

"Time off clamp: 8:18. Total clamp time: 26 minutes," the nurse recorded.

"Neuromonitoring remained stable throughout," Dr. O'Brien reported. "No EEG changes at all. Carmen's brain never knew anything happened."

Yuna watched the suture line carefully for the next few minutes. No bleeding. A couple of tiny oozes from needle holes—expected and normal, they'd seal off with pressure.

"Beautiful case, Dr. Erben," her fellow commented.

"Not done yet," Yuna cautioned. "The carotid endarterectomy is complete, but Carmen has to wake up neurologically intact. That's the real endpoint."

### ACT 4: RECOVERY AND PREVENTION (Panels 33-40)

**Panel 33: Immediate Neurological Assessment**

8:47 AM. In the post-anesthesia care unit, Carmen's eyes fluttered open. Dr. O'Brien had lightened the anesthesia the moment Yuna closed the skin.

"Mrs. Rodriguez? Can you hear me?" Yuna stood at the bedside, still in her surgical scrubs. "Squeeze my hands."

Carmen squeezed both hands equally—strong grip bilaterally.

"Stick out your tongue."

Carmen's tongue protruded in midline—hypoglossal nerve intact.

"Say your name."

"Carmen... Rodriguez," she rasped, throat sore from the breathing tube. Voice clear, no hoarseness—recurrent laryngeal nerve intact.

"Lift both arms up."

Both arms raised equally high. "Good! Now push your feet against my hands." Full strength in both legs.

Yuna smiled broadly, relief washing through her. "Perfect. Neurologically completely intact. The surgery went beautifully."

Carmen managed a weak smile before drifting back into drowsy post-anesthetic haze.

**Panel 34: Blood Pressure Management in PACU**

The PACU nurse watched Carmen's blood pressure closely on the monitor: 182/95.

"Dr. Erben, BP is running a bit high," she reported.

Yuna nodded. "Expected—it's the baroreflex adjustment. Her body got used to the stenosis. Now that we've improved flow, the carotid sinus is sensing more pressure and the body hasn't adjusted yet. Let's bring it down gently—we don't want it too low or too high. Target 140-160 systolic."

She ordered small doses of IV labetalol, titrated carefully. Within 20 minutes, Carmen's pressure stabilized at 148/82—perfect.

"We'll monitor her closely overnight," Yuna told the nurse. "Sudden swings in either direction can be problematic. Too high: bleeding or hemorrhagic stroke. Too low: thrombosis of the endarterectomy site. We maintain the goldilocks zone—just right."

**Panel 35: Awakening - Family Reunion**

10:15 AM. Carmen was awake, alert, and ready to see her family. Maria burst through the PACU doors first, eyes red from anxious waiting.

"Mamá!" She grabbed her mother's hand gently, careful of the IVs.

"Estoy bien, hija," Carmen assured her. (I'm fine, daughter.)

Yuna stood back, watching the reunion with warm satisfaction. This moment—the intact reunion of patient and family—made every hour of training, every sleepless night, every stressful case worthwhile.

"Mrs. Rodriguez did wonderfully," Yuna told the family. "The plaque came out beautifully, no complications, and as you can see, she's neurologically perfect. She can move everything, speak clearly, no deficits at all."

Carmen looked at Yuna with tears in her eyes. "Gracias, Doctora. Thank you for giving me more time with my family."

Yuna squeezed her hand. "You gave yourself time by coming to the hospital when you had symptoms. And by trusting me with your care."

**Panel 36: Explaining Success**

That afternoon, after Carmen transferred to the vascular surgery floor, Yuna gathered the entire extended family in the consultation room. She pulled up the intraoperative photos—with Carmen's prior consent—on the large monitor.

"I want to show you what we removed," Yuna began, displaying an image of the plaque specimen next to a ruler. "This piece of atherosclerotic plaque was narrowing your mother's carotid artery to about 15% of normal diameter. It was 2.5 centimeters long."

She showed before-and-after intraoperative photos. The contrast was dramatic: the yellow, irregular plaque versus the smooth, pink, healthy endarterectomy bed.

"And this is the final result—the artery closed with a patch, restored to normal caliber. Blood flow is now completely normal. Tomorrow we'll do an ultrasound to confirm flow velocities are back to normal range."

Carmen's grandson asked, "Will the plaque grow back?"

"Excellent question," Yuna replied. "The surgery removes what's there now, but it doesn't cure the underlying disease—atherosclerosis. That's why long-term prevention is crucial." She pulled up her next slide: **"Preventing Recurrence."**

**Panel 37: Post-Op Day 1 - Early Mobilization**

The next morning, Carmen sat in a chair beside her bed, eating breakfast. The neck incision, covered with a clean white dressing, looked unremarkable—no swelling, no redness.

Physical therapy arrived. "Time for a walk!" announced Jennifer, the PT, cheerfully.

"Already?" Carmen looked uncertain.

"Absolutely," Yuna confirmed, arriving for morning rounds. "Early mobility prevents blood clots, prevents pneumonia, speeds recovery. You'll feel better once you're moving around."

Carmen walked the hallway with Jennifer's assistance—one lap around the nursing station. A bit unsteady at first, but gaining confidence with each step.

Yuna listened to the surgical site with her Doppler ultrasound—a handheld device that amplified blood flow sounds. A smooth, rhythmic whoosh. "Beautiful flow," she pronounced. "No bruit, which means no turbulence. The patch is wide open."

Carotid duplex ultrasound later that morning confirmed it: peak systolic velocity 65 cm/second in the patch area—completely normal. No residual stenosis.

**Panel 38: Discharge Education - The Five Pillars**

Post-op day 2. Carmen was ready for discharge. Yuna sat down for the final education session, with Maria taking notes.

"Preventing another stroke—and preventing the plaque from reforming—requires what I call the Five Pillars," Yuna began, using her tablet to display an infographic:

**Pillar 1: Antiplatelet Therapy**
"You'll take aspirin 81mg daily, forever. This keeps your platelets from sticking together and forming clots. Non-negotiable."

**Pillar 2: Statin Medication**
"Atorvastatin 80mg at bedtime. This lowers your cholesterol and stabilizes any plaque that's elsewhere in your body. We want your LDL cholesterol below 70. Also non-negotiable."

**Pillar 3: Blood Pressure Control**
"Your target is 140/90 or lower. We'll continue your lisinopril. Home blood pressure monitoring—check it daily for the first month, then weekly."

**Pillar 4: Diabetes Management**
"Keep your A1C below 7.0. Continue metformin. Check blood sugars regularly. Diabetes accelerates atherosclerosis."

**Pillar 5: Lifestyle Modification**
"Diet: Mediterranean-style, low saturated fat, plenty of vegetables. Exercise: walk 30 minutes daily, gradually increase as you feel stronger. No smoking—and avoid secondhand smoke. Limit alcohol."

"All of these together," Yuna emphasized, "reduce your long-term stroke risk dramatically. The surgery fixed the immediate problem. These pillars prevent the long-term problem."

**Panel 39: Two-Week Follow-Up Visit**

Carmen returned to Yuna's clinic two weeks post-op. The neck incision had healed beautifully—a thin pink line that would fade to barely visible over the next few months.

"How do you feel?" Yuna asked.

"Honestly? Better than I have in months. I didn't realize how much that narrowed artery was affecting me. I have more energy. My thinking is clearer. No more episodes of weakness."

Yuna examined the incision, palpated for any fluid collections (none), and listened with her stethoscope. "No bruit. That's what we want to hear—silence. Smooth laminar flow."

She reviewed Carmen's medication list—all being taken as prescribed. Blood pressure log—all readings in target range. Home blood sugar checks—well controlled.

"Perfect compliance. You're doing everything right."

"I promised my grandchildren I'd be around to see them graduate," Carmen said firmly. "I take this seriously."

"I can tell. And that's why you'll do well long-term."

**Panel 40: Three-Month Follow-Up - Long-Term Success**

Three months post-op. Carmen arrived for her follow-up carotid duplex ultrasound beaming with pride. She'd lost 12 pounds through diet and daily walks. Her A1C dropped from 7.8% to 6.9%. Her LDL cholesterol: 58 mg/dL—excellent.

The ultrasound showed a perfect result: widely patent endarterectomy site, normal flow velocities, no evidence of recurrent stenosis. The contralateral left carotid—which had 40% stenosis pre-op—actually looked improved. The lifestyle changes and statin were working.

"This is what success looks like," Yuna told Carmen, showing her the ultrasound images. "Not just the surgery, but everything you've done after. You've taken control of your health."

They sat in the consultation room one final time. Maria had brought her mother's grandchildren—3 kids aged 7, 10, and 14.

"Dr. Erben saved abuela's life," Maria told the children in Spanish.

"With abuela's help," Yuna corrected gently. "She came to the hospital when she had symptoms. She trusted me to operate. And she did all the hard work afterward—taking medications, changing her diet, exercising, managing her diabetes. I just fixed one artery. She's preventing problems in all the rest."

Carmen hugged Yuna—the petite surgeon almost disappearing in the embrace. "Gracias, Doctora. For everything."

Yuna returned the hug, then crouched down to be at eye level with the grandchildren. "You know what I want you to learn from abuela? Your health is precious. Don't wait until you're older to take care of it. Eat well now. Exercise now. Don't smoke ever. Learn from her wisdom."

The 14-year-old raised her hand like in class. "Dr. Erben? How did you become a surgeon?"

Yuna smiled, adjusting her distinctive glasses. "That's a long story. But the short version: I loved science, I loved helping people, and I didn't let being small or being a woman or being an immigrant stop me. Work hard, be kind, and you can do anything."

She shook Carmen's hand one final time. "I'll see you in six months for your next ultrasound. Until then, keep doing everything you're doing."

As the Rodriguez family left, Yuna made one final note in Carmen's chart:

*3-month follow-up: Patient neurologically intact, no stroke, endarterectomy site patent, excellent risk factor modification. Discharged to annual follow-up. Case outcome: Complete success.*

She closed her laptop and smiled. 238 carotid endarterectomies. 238 patients who could continue their lives, see their grandchildren grow, pursue their dreams.

This is why she became a surgeon.
