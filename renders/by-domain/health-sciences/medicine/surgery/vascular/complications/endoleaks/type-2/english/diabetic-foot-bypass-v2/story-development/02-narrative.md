# Diabetic Foot Bypass V2 - Complete Narrative

## Act 1: Recognition & Diagnosis (Panels 1-10)

### Panel 1: Maria's Struggle
Maria Torres, 62, sits on exam table in clinic, wincing as she removes her shoe. A dark, non-healing ulcer is visible on her right great toe. She's worried - she hasn't been able to work at the restaurant for 3 weeks. Dr. Young Erben enters, greeting her warmly in Spanish: "Buenos días, Señora Torres. Cuénteme qué está pasando." (Good morning, Mrs. Torres. Tell me what's happening.)

### Panel 2: The Story Unfolds
Maria explains in Spanish that the wound started 6 months ago after she bumped her toe while cooking. It never healed. Now she has pain even at rest. Dr. Erben listens intently, already noting the concerning signs. "¿Tiene diabetes?" (Do you have diabetes?) Maria nods - 15 years, but she admits she doesn't always take her medications because they're expensive.

### Panel 3: The Examination
Dr. Erben performs a careful foot exam. The ulcer is 2cm, down to bone. The foot is cool. No palpable pulses in dorsalis pedis or posterior tibial. She notes loss of protective sensation - Maria can't feel the monofilament test. "María, vamos a hacer algunas pruebas para ver el flujo de sangre en su pie." (We're going to do some tests to see blood flow in your foot.)

### Panel 4: ABI Testing
In the vascular lab, technician performs ankle-brachial index testing. Numbers appear on screen: Right ABI = 0.42 (severe disease), Left ABI = 0.68 (moderate disease). Dr. Erben explains in Spanish: "Su pie no está recibiendo suficiente sangre. Por eso no se cura la herida." (Your foot isn't getting enough blood. That's why the wound won't heal.)

### Panel 5: Maria's Fear
Maria's eyes fill with tears. "¿Van a cortar mi pie, doctora?" (Are they going to cut off my foot, doctor?) Her daughter Carmen, who accompanied her, grabs her hand. Dr. Erben sits down to their level: "No si puedo evitarlo. Tenemos opciones." (Not if I can help it. We have options.)

### Panel 6: The Choice Explained
Dr. Erben shows anatomical diagrams on tablet, explaining in Spanish how diabetes affects both blood vessels (macrovascular) and nerves (neuropathy). She draws the cascade: poor blood flow → wounds don't heal → infection → gangrene → amputation. "Pero podemos romper este ciclo." (But we can break this cycle.)

### Panel 7: Angiography Planning
Dr. Erben explains need for angiogram to map the arteries. "Necesito ver exactamente dónde están los bloqueos para planear la mejor cirugía." (I need to see exactly where the blockages are to plan the best surgery.) Maria asks about cost - she finally got insurance through her daughter's job, but it just started last month.

### Panel 8: The Angiogram
In angiography suite, contrast dye lights up Maria's leg arteries on fluoroscopy screens. Dr. Erben studies the images intently. Superficial femoral artery has severe stenosis. Popliteal artery patent. Below-knee vessels nearly occluded - peroneal artery has one segment that looks usable. "Tengo un objetivo." (I have a target.)

### Panel 9: The Plan
Back in consultation room, Dr. Erben explains the surgical plan: femoral-to-peroneal artery bypass using vein from Maria's leg. She shows where she'll connect - from femoral artery in groin down to peroneal artery near ankle. "Es como hacer un puente nuevo para que la sangre pueda llegar a su pie." (It's like making a new bridge so blood can reach your foot.)

### Panel 10: The Bigger Picture
Dr. Erben doesn't sugarcoat it: "Señora Torres, la cirugía puede salvar su pie, pero necesitamos tratar la diabetes también. Sin control del azúcar, esto volverá a pasar." (Mrs. Torres, surgery can save your foot, but we need to treat the diabetes too. Without sugar control, this will happen again.) Maria nods seriously - she's ready to do whatever it takes.

## Act 2: Surgical Planning (Panels 11-15)

### Panel 11: Pre-Op Assessment
Dr. Erben reviews Maria's medical history with surgical team. HbA1c 9.2%, poorly controlled for years. Kidney function borderline (Cr 1.8). No cardiac history. Risk assessment: moderate-high, but amputation risk without surgery is very high. "Ella es una buena candidata." (She's a good candidate.)

### Panel 12: Vein Mapping
Ultrasound technician maps Maria's great saphenous vein - checking size and quality. Dr. Erben reviews images: "La vena se ve bien. Diámetro 4mm, sin várices." (The vein looks good. Diameter 4mm, no varicose changes.) This is crucial - they need good quality vein for the bypass conduit.

### Panel 13: Informed Consent
Dr. Erben sits with Maria and Carmen, explaining risks in Spanish: bleeding, infection, bypass failure, amputation still possible if surgery fails, graft occlusion, need for future interventions. Maria listens carefully. "Pero sin la cirugía..." (But without surgery...) Dr. Erben nods: "Sin cirugía, perderá su pie." (Without surgery, you'll lose your foot.)

### Panel 14: Endocrinology Consultation
Dr. Erben arranges urgent endocrinology consult. Diabetes needs optimizing, but can't delay surgery for months. They start insulin, bring glucose under better control within days. HbA1c won't change yet, but immediate glucose management improves wound healing potential.

### Panel 15: The Night Before
Maria in hospital bed, Carmen holding her hand. Dr. Erben stops by evening before surgery: "Mañana voy a hacer todo lo posible para salvar su pie. Usted es fuerte. Lo vamos a lograr juntas." (Tomorrow I'm going to do everything possible to save your foot. You're strong. We're going to achieve this together.) Maria smiles through tears.

## Act 3: Microsurgical Bypass (Panels 16-25)

### Panel 16: OR Preparation
Dawn. OR team assembling. Dr. Erben scrubs in, putting on loupes (surgical magnifying glasses). Anesthesiologist inducing general anesthesia. Surgical tech arranging microsurgical instruments - fine scissors, forceps, suture materials. IV antibiotics started. "Vamos." (Let's go.)

### Panel 17: Vein Harvest
Dr. Erben makes incision along medial aspect of leg, carefully harvesting great saphenous vein. She's meticulous - preserving side branches, checking for leaks. The vein is reversed (valves work in right direction for arterial flow). "Vena perfecta. 65 centímetros." (Perfect vein. 65 centimeters.)

### Panel 18: Proximal Anastomosis
Incision in groin. Dr. Erben exposes femoral artery, applies vascular clamps. She makes precise arteriotomy, then begins suturing vein graft to artery with 6-0 prolene suture. Every stitch is deliberate. Assistant holds retractors. "Sutura." (Suture.) The connection must be perfect - no leaks, no narrowing.

### Panel 19: Tunneling
Dr. Erben creates a tunnel under the skin from groin down to ankle using tunneling device. The vein graft is passed through carefully - no twists, no kinks. This path will carry blood to the foot. It's like laying underground pipeline.

### Panel 20: The Challenge
At ankle, Dr. Erben makes incision, dissects carefully to find peroneal artery. It's tiny - maybe 2mm diameter. This is where her microsurgical training shines. She switches to higher power loupes. "Aquí está." (Here it is.) This requires extreme precision.

### Panel 21: Distal Anastomosis - Setup
Dr. Erben applies micro-vascular clamps to tiny peroneal artery. Makes 4mm arteriotomy. Blood oozes - she irrigates with heparinized saline. Assistant dabs with micro-sponges. Every movement is controlled. "7-0 prolene." She'll need 20+ sutures for this tiny connection.

### Panel 22: The First Stitch
Dr. Erben places first stitch at heel of anastomosis - this anchors everything. She works under magnification. Each stitch is 0.3mm apart. One wrong move and the vessel could tear. Her hands are steady. Years of training for this moment.

### Panel 23: Completing Connection
Stitch by stitch, Dr. Erben completes the circular anastomosis. It's like sewing a garden hose to a drinking straw - the size mismatch is significant. She bevels the vein to match arterial diameter. Surgical assistant watches in awe - this is artistry.

### Panel 24: The Moment of Truth
Dr. Erben removes distal clamp first, then proximal clamp slowly. Blood flows into graft... and then PULSES at ankle. Everyone watches the foot. Within seconds, color returns - from pale white to pink. "¡Está perfundiendo!" (It's perfusing!) The foot is alive.

### Panel 25: Completion Check
Dr. Erben checks pulse in foot with Doppler - strong arterial signal. She checks toe - warm, pink. Capillary refill now less than 2 seconds (was >5 before). The bypass works. "Cerraremos." (We'll close.) Her team smiles behind masks. They've saved the foot.

## Act 4: Recovery & Prevention (Panels 26-35)

### Panel 26: Recovery Room
Maria waking from anesthesia. Dr. Erben at bedside: "Todo salió muy bien. Su pie tiene pulso ahora." (Everything went very well. Your foot has a pulse now.) Maria, still groggy, tries to wiggle toes. They move. She starts crying with relief.

### Panel 27: Post-Op Day 1
Dr. Erben examining foot - still pink, warm. Doppler signals strong. Wound beginning to granulate already - early signs of healing. Carmen is amazed: "¿Es posible que se cure tan rápido?" (Is it possible it heals so fast?) Dr. Erben: "Con sangre llegando ahora, sí." (With blood getting there now, yes.)

### Panel 28: Diabetes Education
While Maria recovers, diabetes educator visits. They discuss insulin dosing, home glucose monitoring, foot care. Dr. Erben joins: "La cirugía es sólo el primer paso. El control del azúcar es crucial." (Surgery is only the first step. Sugar control is crucial.) Maria is taking notes - she's committed now.

### Panel 29: Walking Again
Post-op day 3. Physical therapist helping Maria take first steps. She's wearing special boot to protect foot. Tears of joy - she thought she'd never walk again. "¡Puedo caminar!" (I can walk!) Dr. Erben watches from doorway, smiling.

### Panel 30: Discharge Planning
Dr. Erben explains home care: daily aspirin, statin, insulin regimen, wound care. Weekly vascular lab checks. Monthly clinic visits. "Su nuevo vaso sanguíneo necesita cuidado." (Your new blood vessel needs care.) Schedule for wound care clinic established.

### Panel 31: The Bigger Conversation
Before discharge, Dr. Erben has serious talk with Maria and Carmen: "Señora Torres, esto era prevenible." (This was preventable.) If diabetes had been controlled earlier, if she'd had access to care sooner, this crisis might have been avoided. They discuss healthcare access barriers.

### Panel 32: Three-Month Follow-Up
Maria in vascular lab for duplex ultrasound. Bypass graft is patent (open) with good flow velocities. Wound is completely healed - just pink scar where ulcer was. Maria shows Dr. Erben: "¡Mire! ¡Curado!" (Look! Healed!) Dr. Erben is pleased but checks pedal pulses - both strong.

### Panel 33: Life Changes
Maria back at restaurant, but now wearing proper diabetic shoes. Taking insulin regularly. HbA1c dropped to 7.1%. She checks feet daily. Carmen helps remind her about medications. Maria has become advocate for diabetes education in her community.

### Panel 34: Teaching Moment
Dr. Erben presents Maria's case at grand rounds. She emphasizes: prevention, early intervention, addressing social determinants of health, importance of healthcare access. Maria's story could save others' feet. "This was a technical success, but it represents a system failure that we must address."

### Panel 35: One Year Later - Dancing
Venezuelan festival. Maria dancing with her husband, both feet strong and healthy. Graft still patent on ultrasound. HbA1c stable at 6.9%. She wears medical alert bracelet. She's become volunteer diabetes educator in Spanish-speaking community. Dr. Erben receives photo from Carmen with note: "Gracias por salvar el pie de mi mamá, pero más importante, gracias por enseñarnos a cuidarnos." (Thanks for saving my mom's foot, but more importantly, thanks for teaching us to take care of ourselves.)
