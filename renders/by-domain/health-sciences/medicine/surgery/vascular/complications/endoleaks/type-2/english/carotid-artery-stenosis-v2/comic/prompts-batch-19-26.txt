CHARACTER DESCRIPTIONS:
Dr. Yuna Erben is a petite Korean-American woman in her 40s, approximately 5 feet tall. She has straight black hair pulled back in a neat, practical low ponytail. She wears distinctive expressive rectangular glasses with thin black frames that sit prominently on her face. Her facial features are East Asian: almond-shaped dark brown eyes behind her glasses, small nose, warm smile. She wears teal/cyan colored medical scrubs (#008B8B dark cyan) with a white coat over them when not in the OR, or full surgical gown when operating. Her hands are small and delicate but precise. She has an intelligent, warm, focused expression. Her posture is confident despite her small stature. She wears comfortable medical shoes. Her ethnicity is clearly Korean with East Asian facial features throughout
