## 💡 Pro Tips

### Tip 1: Start Small
Don't try to view all 56 images at once. Pick one 8-panel story first.

### Tip 2: Read First, View Second
The story READMEs provide context that makes images more meaningful.

### Tip 3: Use the Characters
The same 4 characters appear in all stories - this continuity helps learning.

### Tip 4: Check the Index
[INDEX.md](INDEX.md) has every panel listed - use it as a quick reference.

### Tip 5: Print the Quick Reference
[QUICK-REFERENCE.md](QUICK-REFERENCE.md) fits on one page - keep it handy.
