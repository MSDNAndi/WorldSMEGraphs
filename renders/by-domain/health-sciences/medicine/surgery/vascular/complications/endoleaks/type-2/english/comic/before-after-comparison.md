## Panel 1: Opening

### ❌ BEFORE (Current)

**Dialogue**:
> **Camila**: "Ready to map Type 2 endoleaks?"  
> **Camilo**: "Let's explore the hidden flow paths!"  
> **Diego**: "Dr. Erben wants clear visuals."

**Problems**:
- Generic enthusiasm without personality
- No stakes or emotional investment
- Characters already knowledgeable (nothing to learn)
- No hook for reader engagement
- Tone suggests "we've got this" (no growth possible)

---

### ✅ AFTER (Enhanced)

**Dialogue**:
> **Camila** 🎭 *Confident, almost dismissive*  
> "Hola! Type 2 endoleaks? We've read the papers—esto es fácil!"
>
> **Camilo** 🎭 *Joking, casual*  
> "¡Sí! Just map the vessels and we're done by lunch, right?"
>
> **Diego** 🎭 *Slightly skeptical but going along*  
> "Dr. Erben said this is 'more complex than it seems'... but how hard can it be?"
>
> **Thought Bubble to Reader** 💬  
> "Have YOU ever felt confident about something before really understanding it? 🤔"

**Visual Enhancement**:
- Characters have overconfident smirks and cocky body language
- Dr. Erben's complex diagram visible in background (ignored by team)
- Their diagram is oversimplified (single arrow)

---

### 🎓 Why Better

1. **Sets up transformation arc**: Overconfidence → Humility → Mastery
2. **Relatable hook**: Reader recognizes own overconfidence
3. **Foreshadowing**: Dr. Erben's complex diagram hints at coming challenges
4. **Character voice**: Spanish, personality, distinct attitudes
5. **Interactive element**: Reader reflection creates immediate engagement
6. **Dramatic irony**: Reader sees they're wrong; anticipates their learning curve

**Pedagogical principle**: Establish baseline (unconscious incompetence) so growth is visible

---

## Panel 3: Define Type 2

### ❌ BEFORE (Current)

**Dialogue**:
> **Camilo**: "Type 2 = retrograde inflow from branches."  
> **Camila**: "Not a seal leak; collaterals feed the sac."

**Problems**:
- Pure information delivery (lecture mode)
- No confusion or discovery process
- Characters already know the answer
- No misconceptions challenged
- Reader is passive recipient
- Terminology not unpacked

---

### ✅ AFTER (Enhanced)

**Dialogue**:
> **Camilo** 🎭 *Confused, questioning tone*  
> "Wait... it's NOT a seal leak? I thought endoleaks were stent failures..."
>
> **Camila** 🎭 *Re-reading definition, frowning*  
> "Retrograde inflow? From which direction? There are so many branches!"
>
> **Diego** 🎭 *Flipping through notes frantically*  
> "The stent works FINE but blood finds another way?! How is that possible?"
>
> **Interactive to Reader** 💬  
> "Reader, what OTHER paths could blood take? Think about it! 🔍"

**Visual Enhancement**:
- Characters have furrowed brows, confused expressions
- One character scratching head
- Multiple arrows showing complex flow (not one simple arrow)

---

> "...but BRIGHT in delayed phase! The contrast took TIME to arrive through the collaterals!"
>
> **Diego** 🎭 *Understanding clicking*  
> "So delayed blush equals slow retrograde filling! That's why we need both phases—now I see it!"
>
> **Interactive to Reader** 💬  
> "Can YOU spot the difference? Look closely at the sac! 🔍"

**Visual Enhancement**:
- Clear side-by-side comparison with arrows
- Magnifying glass icons
- Lightbulb/spark indicating understanding
