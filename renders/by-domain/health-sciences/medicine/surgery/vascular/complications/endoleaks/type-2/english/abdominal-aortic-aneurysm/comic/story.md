## The Story


### Act 1: Discovery

**Panel 1: Screening Day at the VA**

*Setting: VA Hospital ultrasound room, bright and welcoming*

[{'speaker': 'Camila', 'text': 'Mrs. Chen! Welcome to your free AAA screening!'}, {'speaker': 'Mrs. Chen', 'text': 'My doctor said all veterans over 65 should get this. What are we looking for?'}, {'speaker': 'Camila', 'text': 'We check your abdominal aorta - the big artery in your belly. Sometimes it can enlarge like a balloon!'}]

---

**Panel 2: The Unexpected Finding**

*Setting: Same ultrasound room, Camila's expression changes to concern*

[{'speaker': 'Camila', 'text': '(looking at screen) Hmm... Mrs. Chen, I need to measure this carefully...'}, {'speaker': 'Mrs. Chen', 'text': 'Is something wrong? I feel fine!'}, {'speaker': 'Camila', 'text': "That's actually common with aneurysms. Let me get my attending to look at this."}]

---

**Panel 3: Team Assembly**

*Setting: Hospital hallway, Camila calling team*

[{'speaker': 'Camila', 'text': 'Team! I found a 6.2 cm AAA on screening. We need to move fast!'}, {'speaker': 'Camilo', 'text': "6.2?! That's well above surgical threshold. Need CT angio NOW."}, {'speaker': 'Diego', 'text': "I'll prep the patient for imaging. This could rupture any time!"}]

---

**Panel 4: Dr. Erben's Teaching Moment**

*Setting: Conference room with anatomical models*

[{'speaker': 'Dr. Erben', 'text': 'Great catch, Camila! AAAs are silent killers. Most patients have no symptoms until...'}, {'speaker': 'Diego', 'text': "Until they rupture! Then it's catastrophic bleeding."}, {'speaker': 'Dr. Erben', 'text': "Exactly. Our job: Fix it before it ruptures. But HOW we fix it - that's the art."}]

---

**Panel 5: CT Angiography Reveals All**

*Setting: Radiology reading room with large monitors*

[{'speaker': 'Camilo', 'text': "CTA is back! Let's see the anatomy... Measuring the neck..."}, {'speaker': 'Camila', 'text': 'What are we looking for?'}, {'speaker': 'Camilo', 'text': 'Neck length, angulation, iliac access - determines if we can do EVAR or need open repair.'}]

---

**Panel 6: Anatomy Assessment**

*Setting: Same reading room, team discussing findings*

[{'speaker': 'Camilo', 'text': 'Neck length is 15mm - barely adequate. Angle is 45° - acceptable.'}, {'speaker': 'Dr. Erben', 'text': "Iliacs look okay for access. She's a borderline EVAR candidate."}, {'speaker': 'Diego', 'text': 'What about open repair?'}, {'speaker': 'Dr. Erben', 'text': "Higher short-term risk, but more durable. Let's discuss with Mrs. Chen."}]

---

**Panel 7: Patient Education Session**

*Setting: Patient consultation room with models and diagrams*

[{'speaker': 'Camila', 'text': 'Mrs. Chen, your aorta has bulged like a weak spot in a garden hose.'}, {'speaker': 'Mrs. Chen', 'text': 'And it could burst?'}, {'speaker': 'Dr. Erben', 'text': 'Yes. We can fix it two ways: through small groin incisions, or one big belly incision.'}]

---

**Panel 8: Mrs. Chen's Choice**

*Setting: Same consultation room*

[{'speaker': 'Mrs. Chen', 'text': "Doctor, I survived the Korean War. I want to be tough, but... I'm 73 now."}, {'speaker': 'Mrs. Chen', 'text': 'Can we try the minimally invasive way? I want to recover fast for my grandkids.'}, {'speaker': 'Dr. Erben', 'text': "EVAR it is. We'll monitor you closely. Surgery scheduled for tomorrow!"}]

---

**Panel 9: Pre-Op Planning**

*Setting: Vascular surgery conference room with digital displays*

[{'speaker': 'Dr. Erben', 'text': "Let's plan the EVAR. Diego, what endograft size do we need?"}, {'speaker': 'Diego', 'text': 'Main body: 28mm diameter, 150mm length. Limbs: 14mm bilateral.'}, {'speaker': 'Camilo', 'text': 'Neck is our challenge - only 15mm. Need good seal or we get Type 1a endoleak.'}]

---

**Panel 10: Implant Selection**

*Setting: Device room with endografts on shelves*

[{'speaker': 'Diego', 'text': "Here's our endograft - it's like a fabric-covered stent that lines the aneurysm."}, {'speaker': 'Camila', 'text': 'So it redirects blood flow INSIDE this tube, excluding the aneurysm sac?'}, {'speaker': 'Diego', 'text': 'Exactly! The aneurysm shrinks over time when blood pressure is off it.'}]

---

**Panel 11: Anesthesia Prep**

*Setting: Pre-op holding area*

[{'speaker': 'Anesthesiologist', 'text': "Mrs. Chen, we'll use general anesthesia for the EVAR. You'll be completely asleep."}, {'speaker': 'Mrs. Chen', 'text': 'Will I feel anything after?'}, {'speaker': 'Camila', 'text': 'Much less pain than open surgery! Most EVAR patients go home in 1-2 days.'}]

---

**Panel 12: Hybrid OR Setup**

*Setting: State-of-the-art hybrid operating room with C-arm fluoroscopy*

[{'speaker': 'Dr. Erben', 'text': 'Everyone, this is a hybrid OR - combines surgery with real-time imaging.'}, {'speaker': 'Diego', 'text': 'That C-arm gives us live X-ray to guide the endograft!'}, {'speaker': 'Camilo', 'text': "Amazing! It's like GPS for the inside of the aorta."}]

---

**Panel 13: Access Gained**

*Setting: OR, surgical field focused on bilateral groin incisions*

[{'speaker': 'Dr. Erben', 'text': 'Diego, isolate the common femoral arteries bilaterally. Need good exposure.'}, {'speaker': 'Diego', 'text': 'Right femoral exposed... Now left... Got them both!'}, {'speaker': 'Dr. Erben', 'text': 'Good. Pursestring sutures in place. Time to introduce our wires.'}]

---

**Panel 14: Wire Navigation**

*Setting: OR with fluoroscopy screen visible*

[{'speaker': 'Dr. Erben', 'text': 'Stiff wire advancing... through the aneurysm sac... past the renal arteries...'}, {'speaker': 'Camilo', 'text': 'Perfect position on fluoro! Wire tip is in the thoracic aorta.'}, {'speaker': 'Dr. Erben', 'text': 'Now the critical part - positioning the main body endograft.'}]

---

**Panel 15: Main Body Deployment - The Critical Moment**

*Setting: OR, tension in the air*

[{'speaker': 'Dr. Erben', 'text': 'Main body advanced over wire... Positioned below renals... Everyone ready?'}, {'speaker': 'Camilo', 'text': 'Fluoro confirms position - looks perfect!'}, {'speaker': 'Dr. Erben', 'text': 'Deploying main body... NOW!'}, {'speaker': 'Diego', 'text': "It's opening! Beautiful deployment!"}]

---

**Panel 16: Contralateral Limb Cannulation**

*Setting: OR, working on left limb*

[{'speaker': 'Dr. Erben', 'text': 'Now the tricky part - cannulating the contralateral gate from the left side.'}, {'speaker': 'Diego', 'text': 'Catheter advancing... angling up... got it! Wire through the gate!'}, {'speaker': 'Dr. Erben', 'text': 'Excellent! Now deploy the left limb.'}]

---

**Panel 17: Completion Angiogram**

*Setting: OR, injecting contrast*

[{'speaker': 'Dr. Erben', 'text': "Inject contrast - let's see how we did..."}, {'speaker': 'Camilo', 'text': 'Watching the fluoro... Flow looks good through the graft...'}, {'speaker': 'Camilo', 'text': 'Wait - I see contrast outside the graft at the proximal neck!'}]

---

**Panel 18: Endoleak Diagnosis**

*Setting: OR, team discussing*

[{'speaker': 'Dr. Erben', 'text': "That's a Type 1a endoleak - blood flowing between graft and neck. This is serious."}, {'speaker': 'Diego', 'text': 'What does that mean?'}, {'speaker': 'Dr. Erben', 'text': 'Aneurysm sac still under pressure - could rupture! We need to fix this NOW.'}]

---

**Panel 19: Molding the Seal**

*Setting: OR, deploying balloon*

[{'speaker': 'Dr. Erben', 'text': "Let's try balloon molding first. Diego, advance the compliant balloon."}, {'speaker': 'Diego', 'text': 'Balloon positioned at the proximal neck... Inflating...'}, {'speaker': 'Dr. Erben', 'text': 'Gently! We want to mold the graft to the aortic wall, not rupture the neck.'}]

---

**Panel 20: Repeat Angiogram - Success!**

*Setting: OR, injecting contrast again*

[{'speaker': 'Dr. Erben', 'text': 'Deflating balloon... Now repeat the angiogram...'}, {'speaker': 'Camilo', 'text': 'Injecting contrast... Watching...'}, {'speaker': 'Camilo', 'text': 'No leak! Seal looks perfect now!'}, {'speaker': 'Dr. Erben', 'text': 'Excellent! Aneurysm sac is excluded. Crisis averted.'}]

---

**Panel 21: Closing Up**

*Setting: OR, closing groin incisions*

[{'speaker': 'Dr. Erben', 'text': 'Diego, close the arteriotomies carefully. These need to heal perfectly.'}, {'speaker': 'Diego', 'text': 'Prolene suture closing right femoral... Now left...'}, {'speaker': 'Dr. Erben', 'text': 'Good. Total procedure time: 2 hours. Not bad for a complex case!'}]

---

**Panel 22: Post-Op Check**

*Setting: Recovery room, Mrs. Chen waking up*

[{'speaker': 'Mrs. Chen', 'text': '(groggily) Is... is it over?'}, {'speaker': 'Camila', 'text': 'Yes! Your aneurysm is fixed! How do you feel?'}, {'speaker': 'Mrs. Chen', 'text': 'Surprisingly good! Just some groin soreness. When can I go home?'}, {'speaker': 'Dr. Erben', 'text': "If all goes well, tomorrow! But you'll need regular imaging check-ups."}]

---

**Panel 23: Post-Op Day 1**

*Setting: Hospital room, Mrs. Chen walking with Camila*

[{'speaker': 'Camila', 'text': 'Great job walking! How does it feel compared to big surgery?'}, {'speaker': 'Mrs. Chen', 'text': 'My neighbor had open AAA repair - he was in the hospital for a week! I feel pretty good!'}, {'speaker': 'Diego', 'text': "That's the advantage of EVAR - faster recovery. But remember, you'll need lifelong surveillance."}]

---

**Panel 24: Education on Surveillance**

*Setting: Hospital room, team using tablet to show images*

[{'speaker': 'Camilo', 'text': "Mrs. Chen, here's your follow-up schedule: CT scan at 1 month, 6 months, 1 year, then yearly."}, {'speaker': 'Mrs. Chen', 'text': 'Why so many scans?'}, {'speaker': 'Camila', 'text': "We're watching for endoleaks - blood leaking back into the aneurysm sac. If that happens, we fix it!"}]

---

**Panel 25: One Month Follow-Up CTA**

*Setting: Radiology reading room*

[{'speaker': 'Camilo', 'text': "Mrs. Chen's 1-month CTA is back! Let's review..."}, {'speaker': 'Camila', 'text': 'How does the seal look?'}, {'speaker': 'Camilo', 'text': 'Perfect! No endoleak. Aneurysm sac has already shrunk from 6.2 to 5.8 cm!'}]

---

**Panel 26: Mrs. Chen Returns to Life**

*Setting: VA Hospital lobby, Mrs. Chen with grandchildren*

[{'speaker': 'Mrs. Chen', 'text': 'Camila! Look who I brought to my checkup!'}, {'speaker': 'Grandchild', 'text': 'Grandma says you saved her life!'}, {'speaker': 'Camila', 'text': "We caught it early because she came for screening. That's the key!"}]

---

**Panel 27: Literature Review Session**

*Setting: Conference room, team studying papers*

[{'speaker': 'Dr. Erben', 'text': "Let's discuss the EVAR trials. What did EVAR-1 and DREAM show?"}, {'speaker': 'Diego', 'text': 'Lower 30-day mortality with EVAR, but long-term outcomes similar to open repair.'}, {'speaker': 'Camilo', 'text': 'And EVAR requires reinterventions - about 20% by 5 years.'}, {'speaker': 'Dr. Erben', 'text': 'Right. Trade-offs: lower early risk vs need for surveillance and reinterventions.'}]

---

**Panel 28: Endoleak Classification Review**

*Setting: Conference room with projector*

[{'speaker': 'Dr. Erben', 'text': "We saw a Type 1a endoleak in Mrs. Chen's case. Let's review all five types."}, {'speaker': 'Camila', 'text': 'Type 1 is seal failure - Type 1a at proximal neck, Type 1b at distal seal.'}, {'speaker': 'Diego', 'text': 'Type 2 is from branch vessels - like lumbar or IMA.'}, {'speaker': 'Camilo', 'text': 'Type 3 is graft failure. Type 4 is graft porosity. Type 5 is endotension - pressure with no visible leak!'}]

---

**Panel 29: Screening Advocacy**

*Setting: Community health fair, team running AAA screening booth*

[{'speaker': 'Camila', 'text': 'Free AAA screening today! Quick ultrasound, could save your life!'}, {'speaker': 'Community member', 'text': "I'm 72 and smoked for 40 years. Should I get screened?"}, {'speaker': 'Diego', 'text': "Absolutely! You're exactly who we want to screen. It takes 5 minutes!"}]

---

**Panel 30: Rupture Prevention Statistics**

*Setting: Conference room, presenting to medical students*

[{'speaker': 'Camila', 'text': 'Ruptured AAA has 80-90% mortality. But elective repair? Only 1-5% mortality!'}, {'speaker': 'Student', 'text': 'So screening really works?'}, {'speaker': 'Camila', 'text': 'Yes! Studies show AAA screening reduces AAA-related deaths by 40-50% in screened populations!'}]

---

**Panel 31: Team Reflection - Patience and Vigilance**

*Setting: Hospital rooftop at sunset*

[{'speaker': 'Diego', 'text': 'This case taught me that surgery is just the beginning. Lifelong surveillance is part of EVAR.'}, {'speaker': 'Camilo', 'text': 'And complications can happen - like that Type 1a endoleak. Good thing we caught it intraoperatively!'}, {'speaker': 'Camila', 'text': "The real win? Mrs. Chen came for screening. Prevention and early detection - that's the future!"}]

---

**Panel 32: Next Adventure Preview**

*Setting: Hospital hallway, intern receiving urgent page*

[{'speaker': 'Camila', 'text': '(looking at pager) Uh oh. Code Vascular - ER!'}, {'speaker': 'Diego', 'text': 'What is it?'}, {'speaker': 'Camila', 'text': "55-year-old woman with sudden 'dead leg' - painful, pale, pulseless!"}, {'speaker': 'Camilo', 'text': "Acute limb ischemia! We need to move NOW! Let's go team!"}]
