===== PANEL 01: Courtyard Kickoff =====

=== STYLE FOUNDATION ===

Art Style: Dora the Explorer inspired educational illustration designed for research interns and medical students. 2D flat illustration with thick black outlines (3-4 pixel weight) on all major elements including characters, props, and background structures. The rendering should have a vector-like smoothness with no heavy textures or grain. Color palette consists of bright, saturated pastels: sky blues (#87CEEB for sky), grass greens (#90EE90 for lawn areas), sunshine yellows (#FFD700 for accent elements), warm oranges (#FFA500 for highlighting), and soft purples (#DDA0DD for subtle details). Line quality is bold, confident, and friendly with clean, definitive strokes and no sketchy or rough edges. Shading is minimal cel-shading style with single soft shadows on the ground plane only - no complex volumetric shading. All surfaces appear smooth and vector-like. Lighting is bright, even, and cheerful, simulating clear midday outdoor light with high visibility and no dramatic contrasts. The perspective uses a slight isometric feel with gentle depth but without aggressive foreshortening - everything feels accessible and friendly. The overall mood is energetic, optimistic, adventurous, and educational - immediately conveying that this is a fun learning journey.

=== CHARACTER 1: CAMILA ===

Physical Appearance: Camila is a young woman of Ecuadorian heritage in her early twenties with warm light brown skin (hex #D4A574). She has a youthful, friendly face with round, approachable features, warm brown eyes that sparkle with enthusiasm, and a genuine smile showing slight dimples on both cheeks. Her long dark brown hair (hex #654321) is styled in a single thick braid that drapes over her LEFT shoulder (from viewer's perspective), reaching down to mid-torso level. The braid is secured at the end with a small purple hair tie that matches her backpack. Fine baby hairs frame her face naturally.

Outfit (IDENTICAL IN EVERY PANEL): Camila wears a teal explorer vest (hex #20B2AA) as her signature garment. The vest has six visible pockets - three on each side - with flap closures. On the RIGHT chest (viewer's left when facing her) is a large decorative sunflower patch measuring approximately 3 inches in diameter, featuring bright yellow petals arranged in a circle around a dark brown center. Underneath the vest, she wears a plain white short-sleeve t-shirt with a crew neck. Her lower half features teal shorts (hex #20B2AA, matching the vest) that hit at mid-thigh length. On her feet are tan hiking boots (hex #D2B48C) with brown laces tied securely, rising to ankle height. Strapped to her back via both shoulders is a rectangular purple backpack (hex #9370DB) with visible black straps crossing her chest in an X pattern. On her LEFT chest (viewer's right when facing her) is a white rectangular name badge with rounded corners displaying "Camila" in black Arial Bold font, approximately 0.75 inches tall text.

Body Language THIS PANEL: Camila stands with her weight distributed evenly on both feet, positioned in a confident, open stance. Her RIGHT arm (viewer's left) is raised enthusiastically, with her hand pointing forward and slightly upward at approximately a 45-degree angle above horizontal, index finger extended. Her LEFT hand holds a brown hardboard clipboard with metal clip against her LEFT hip, with the clipboard angled slightly outward. Her head is tilted 15 degrees to her RIGHT (viewer's left), and her eyes are wide and bright with excitement. Her mouth is open in a mid-speech smile, conveying energetic enthusiasm as she asks her question.

Position in Frame: Camila is positioned at the LEFT-CENTER of the frame, occupying approximately 60-85% of the frame's height from ground to top. She is angled approximately 30 degrees to the viewer's RIGHT (so we see slightly more of her left side). She stands approximately 3 feet in front of the background easel. She casts a single soft shadow extending 2 feet to the viewer's RIGHT, with 30% opacity and soft, blurred edges.

=== CHARACTER 2: CAMILO ===

Physical Appearance: Camilo is a young man of Colombian heritage in his early twenties with medium brown skin (hex #C19A6B).

On the RIGHT chest is a decorative topographic map patch showing stylized contour lines in brown on a beige background, measuring approximately 3 inches square. Underneath the vest, he wears a plain white short-sleeve t-shirt with a crew neck. His lower half features khaki pants (hex #C3B091) that reach to his ankles. On his feet are tan hiking boots (hex #D2B48C) identical in style to Camila's, with brown laces. Strapped to his back via both shoulders is a rectangular orange backpack (hex #FFA500) with visible black straps. On his LEFT chest is a white rectangular name badge displaying "Camilo" in black Arial Bold font, approximately 0.75 inches tall text.

Body Language THIS PANEL: Camilo stands in a dynamic, engaged posture with his weight on his LEFT leg. His RIGHT hand is raised to about chest height, holding his clipboard vertically as if presenting it. His LEFT arm hangs naturally at his side with a slight bend at the elbow. His torso leans forward slightly (about 10 degrees), conveying eagerness and forward momentum. His head is straight, facing forward-RIGHT at about 20 degrees, with bright eyes and an excited smile, mouth open as he speaks his line about exploring.

Position in Frame: Camilo is positioned at the CENTER of the frame, occupying approximately 60-85% of the frame's height. He is facing approximately 20 degrees to the viewer's RIGHT. He stands in the middle ground, approximately 3 feet in front of the easel, aligned horizontally between Camila and Diego. He casts a single soft shadow extending 2 feet to the viewer's RIGHT, matching Camila's shadow characteristics.

=== CHARACTER 3: DIEGO ===

Physical Appearance: Diego is a young man of Colombian heritage in his early twenties with lightly brown skin (hex #B8956A). He has a friendly, thoughtful face with short curly dark hair (hex #2C1810) with natural volume and texture, warm brown eyes behind subtle round-framed glasses (thin black frames), and a confident smile.

On his LEFT chest is a white rectangular name badge displaying "Diego" in black Arial Bold font, approximately 0.75 inches tall text.

Body Language THIS PANEL: Diego stands in a relaxed but attentive posture with his weight on his RIGHT leg, LEFT hip slightly jutted out. His RIGHT hand rests on his hip in a confident but friendly pose. His LEFT hand holds his clipboard down at his side, angled slightly outward. His head is tilted slightly to his LEFT (viewer's right), and he has a knowing, slightly humorous expression with a slight smirk, as if he's in on the adventure and enjoying the energy. His eyes look toward Camila and Camilo, acknowledging their enthusiasm.

Position in Frame: Diego is positioned at the RIGHT-CENTER of the frame, occupying approximately 60-85% of the frame's height. He is angled approximately 330 degrees (30 degrees to viewer's LEFT), so we see slightly more of his right side. He stands in the middle ground, approximately 3 feet in front of the easel, completing the triangle formation with Camila and Camilo. He casts a single soft shadow extending 2 feet to the viewer's RIGHT.

=== SCENE COMPOSITION & FRAMING ===

Camera/Viewpoint: The camera is positioned at eye level with a very slight low angle (approximately 5 degrees below the horizon line), creating an inclusive, inviting perspective that places the viewer at the same level as the characters. This is a medium-wide shot that captures all three characters from knees up while also showing the significant environmental context including the easel behind them and the hospital building in the background. The shot distance is approximately 10 feet from the character group. Framing follows the rule of thirds with Camila positioned along the LEFT vertical third line, Camilo near the CENTER, and Diego along the RIGHT vertical third line. The easel is positioned on the CENTER vertical line in the background. All elements are in sharp focus with no depth-of-field blur - the educational clarity requires that everything be equally visible and legible.

Foreground Elements: The ground plane consists of textured concrete courtyard surface (hex #C0C0C0) with subtle expansion joint lines creating a gentle grid pattern approximately every 4 feet. The concrete has a very slight mottled texture suggesting aged outdoor pavement but remains light and bright. Overlaid on the concrete are colorful chalk-like arrows drawn in a playful, child-like style. These arrows are rendered in various bright colors: two orange arrows (hex #FFA500), one blue arrow (hex #1E90FF), two green arrows (hex #32CD32), and one pink arrow (hex #FF69B4). Each arrow is 2-3 feet long, hand-drawn in appearance with thick lines (approximately 3 inches wide), pointing from the foreground toward the easel in the background, creating a visual path that guides the eye. The arrows have simple triangular heads and straight or gently curved shafts. In the LOWER RIGHT corner of the frame sits a small decorative element: a potted plant in a terracotta pot (hex #E07A5F) approximately 8 inches in diameter, containing vibrant green leaves (hex #228B22) of a generic tropical-looking foliage plant.

Midground Elements: The three characters (Camila, Camilo, Diego) occupy the midground as described in their individual specifications above. They are arranged in a gentle arc formation that feels natural and conversational, with approximately 4 feet of space between each character. Behind and between them, positioned approximately 6 feet back from the character line, stands the easel described below.

Background Elements - Easel: A wooden presentation easel with three legs (two visible front legs, one rear leg), constructed of light wood (hex #DEB887). The easel holds a large white presentation board measuring approximately 24 inches wide by 36 inches tall. The board displays a simplified medical illustration of an aorta with Type 2 endoleak. The diagram shows: a red tube representing the descending aorta (hex #DC143C) running vertically down the center-left of the board; a bulging section in the middle representing an aneurysm sac (same red color but wider, approximately 4 inches in diagram space); a gray mesh overlay representing a stent graft (hex #A9A9A9, rendered with diagonal crosshatch pattern); and two small red tubes branching from the aorta to the LEFT and RIGHT representing lumbar artery branches. One of these branches (the right one on the diagram) has a dotted red arrow (dashed line, same red color) pointing back INTO the sac, indicating retrograde flow. At the top of the diagram, in bold red text (Arial Bold, approximately 2 inches tall) is the label "Type 2 Endoleak." Below the retrograde arrow is smaller text reading "Retrograde Flow" in black. The entire presentation board has a thin black outline border.

Background Elements - Environment: The UPPER portion of the frame (approximately top 40%) shows the hospital building and sky. The Mayo Clinic Jacksonville building facade features modern tan brick (hex #D2B48C) with large rectangular windows arranged in a grid pattern. The windows have a slight blue-tinted reflection (hex #B0C4DE) suggesting glass reflecting the sky. The building spans the full width of the frame but is rendered slightly out of focus to keep attention on the characters (still fully legible, just with slightly softer edges). Above the building, the sky occupies the TOP 20-25% of the frame and is rendered in bright, clear blue (hex #87CEEB) with three small, wispy white clouds (hex #FFFFFF with very slight gray tinting #F5F5F5 on their undersides). The clouds are stylized and friendly in shape - cumulus-type but simplified. In the background, on both the FAR LEFT and FAR RIGHT edges of the frame, are two palm trees. Each tree has a brown trunk (hex #8B4513) rising approximately 15 feet tall with a crown of green fronds (hex #228B22) at the top, splaying outward in the characteristic palm pattern. Between the concrete courtyard and the building is a strip of manicured grass lawn (hex #90EE90) approximately 6 feet wide, creating a pleasant landscaped buffer.

=== KEY VISUAL ELEMENTS ===

Primary Focus Element - Aorta Diagram: As described above in the easel section, this is the primary educational element of the scene. It measures 24 inches wide by 36 inches tall (in the context of the scene's scale). The diagram uses simplified medical illustration style but remains friendly and accessible, using the bright color palette of the comic. The aorta tube is approximately 2 inches wide in the diagram, expanding to 4 inches at the aneurysm sac. The stent graft overlay is semi-transparent (approximately 50% opacity) so the underlying red vessels are visible through it. The mesh pattern consists of diagonal lines at 45-degree angles forming diamond shapes approximately 0.5 inches across. The lumbar branch vessels are approximately 0.5 inches in diameter on the diagram. The retrograde flow arrow is rendered as a dashed line with 0.25-inch dashes separated by 0.125-inch gaps, terminating in a clear triangular arrowhead pointing INTO the sac (toward the CENTER of the sac bulge). All labels use clean, sans-serif fonts (Arial family) and are positioned with adequate white space around them for clarity.

Secondary Elements - Clipboards: Each of the three characters holds an identical clipboard. Each clipboard consists of a brown hardboard backing (hex #8B4513, masonite texture) measuring 9 inches wide by 12 inches tall, topped with a metal clip (silver/gray hex #C0C0C0) at the top center for holding papers. Attached to each clipboard is a white sheet of paper (hex #FFFFFF) with light blue grid lines (hex #ADD8E6) visible in a standard graph paper pattern (0.25-inch squares). On each paper are visible but not legible scribbles in black ink suggesting notes and diagrams, but intentionally kept abstract so as not to distract from the main content. The clipboards are rendered with a slight dimensionality - the hardboard is approximately 0.25 inches thick, visible when viewed at an angle.

Secondary Elements - Ground Arrows: As described in foreground, there are 6 arrows total. Their specific positions: Arrow 1 (orange) starts at LOWER LEFT corner, points toward easel at 45-degree angle, length 3 feet. Arrow 2 (blue) starts at LOWER CENTER-LEFT, points directly toward easel, length 2.5 feet. Arrow 3 (green) starts at LOWER CENTER, points toward easel at 10-degree angle RIGHT, length 2 feet. Arrow 4 (green) starts at LOWER CENTER-RIGHT, points toward easel at 350-degree angle LEFT, length 2 feet. Arrow 5 (pink) starts at LOWER RIGHT (LEFT of the potted plant), points toward easel at 320-degree angle, length 2.5 feet. Arrow 6 (orange) starts at CENTER-LEFT midground, points toward easel at 30-degree angle, length 1.5 feet. These arrows are rendered with a chalk-on-pavement texture (slight grainy quality but still bright colors) and have organic, hand-drawn shapes - not perfectly straight or geometric.

=== TEXT & SPEECH BUBBLES ===

Speech Bubble 1 (Camila): This bubble emanates from Camila's mouth region, with a curving tail that points directly to her slightly parted lips. The tail starts at approximately 0.5 inches from her mouth, narrows to a point at her lips, and curves gently. The tail is positioned at 45 degrees downward-LEFT (toward her mouth from the bubble). The bubble itself is an oval shape measuring approximately 8 inches wide by 4.5 inches tall (in scene scale), positioned in the UPPER LEFT quadrant of the frame, above and to the LEFT of Camila's head. The bubble does not overlap with her head or any other characters. The bubble border is a smooth black outline (hex #000000) with 2-pixel weight and perfectly rounded corners creating a friendly oval shape. The fill is pure white (hex #FFFFFF) with a very subtle shadow effect on the RIGHT and BOTTOM edges - this shadow is light gray (hex #E0E0E0), 3 pixels wide, with soft blur (5-pixel radius), creating gentle depth. Inside the bubble, the text reads exactly: "Ready to map Type 2 endoleaks?" (note the question mark). The text uses Comic Sans MS font (or similar friendly rounded sans-serif if Comic Sans is unavailable) in black (hex #000000). The text size is such that it occupies approximately 70% of the bubble's width, leaving comfortable margins. The text is medium-bold weight (font-weight: 600 in web terms) and is perfectly centered both horizontally and vertically within the bubble. The line height is 1.3 times the font size, and letter-spacing (kerning) is set to comfortable defaults for readability. If the text wraps to two lines (which it should at this size), "Ready to map" appears on the first line and "Type 2 endoleaks?" on the second, with both lines center-aligned.

Speech Bubble 2 (Camilo): This bubble emanates from Camilo's mouth region, with a curving tail pointing to his lips. The tail is positioned at 30 degrees downward-RIGHT (toward his mouth from the bubble). The bubble is an oval shape measuring approximately 9 inches wide by 4.5 inches tall, positioned in the UPPER CENTER quadrant of the frame, above and slightly to the RIGHT of Camilo's head. The bubble styling is identical to Bubble 1 (black 2px outline, white fill, subtle gray shadow on RIGHT and BOTTOM). Inside the bubble, the text reads exactly: "Let's explore the hidden flow paths!" The text uses the same Comic Sans MS font in black, medium-bold weight, centered in the bubble. The text size is such that it occupies approximately 75% of the bubble's width. If wrapping, "Let's explore the hidden" appears on the first line and "flow paths!" on the second, both center-aligned.

Speech Bubble 3 (Diego): This bubble emanates from Diego's mouth region, with a curving tail pointing to his lips. The tail is positioned at 20 degrees downward-CENTER (toward his mouth from the bubble). The bubble is an oval shape measuring approximately 8.5 inches wide by 4 inches tall, positioned in the UPPER RIGHT quadrant of the frame, above and to the RIGHT of Diego's head. The bubble styling matches the previous bubbles exactly. Inside the bubble, the text reads exactly: "Dr. Erben wants clear visuals." The text uses the same Comic Sans MS font in black, medium-bold weight, centered in the bubble. The text size is such that it occupies approximately 70% of the bubble's width. This text likely fits on a single line, but if it wraps, "Dr. Erben wants" appears on the first line and "clear visuals." on the second.

Text Arrangement & Spacing: The three speech bubbles are arranged in a clear reading pattern from LEFT to RIGHT across the top portion of the frame. Bubble 1 (Camila) is positioned highest and leftmost. Bubble 2 (Camilo) is positioned in the center, slightly lower than Bubble 1 (approximately 1 inch lower). Bubble 3 (Diego) is positioned rightmost, at approximately the same height as Bubble 1. There is at least 2 inches of clear space between any two bubbles - they do not overlap or touch. All three bubbles are fully contained within the frame boundaries with at least 1 inch of margin from the frame edge. The bubbles do not overlap with any character heads, the easel, or any other important visual elements. The overall effect is clean, organized, and easy to read in sequence.

=== LIGHTING & ATMOSPHERE ===

Lighting Source & Quality: The primary light source is a simulated overhead sun positioned slightly LEFT of CENTER above the scene (approximately 15 degrees LEFT of vertical center). The sun itself is not visible in the frame. The lighting is bright, cheerful, and even - this is high-key lighting with no dramatic contrasts or harsh shadows. The color temperature is warm daylight equivalent to approximately 5500K, creating a pleasant, energetic atmosphere. The light falls evenly on all characters and scene elements, with no significant falloff or vignetting.

Shadows: Each character casts a single soft shadow on the ground plane. These shadows extend approximately 2 feet to the viewer's RIGHT and slightly BACK (at about 110-degree angle from each character's position). The shadows have an opacity of approximately 30%, rendered in dark gray (hex #404040) with heavily blurred edges (blur radius of approximately 50 pixels at full resolution, creating very soft, fuzzy edges). The shadows follow the general shape of the characters' footprints but are elongated and diffused. The easel casts a similar soft shadow extending to the RIGHT. The potted plant casts a small circular shadow. No other objects cast significant shadows. The shadows never have hard edges and never create high-contrast areas - they remain subtle and friendly.

Highlights: Subtle white highlights (hex #FFFFFF at 40% opacity) appear on the top surfaces of characters' hair, suggesting the overhead light catching the hair's curve. Specifically, each character has a small white highlight approximately 2 inches long on the crown of their head. The metallic clipboard clips have small sharp highlights (white at 80% opacity, approximately 0.25 inches across) suggesting their reflective metal surface. The glossy presentation board on the easel has a very subtle white highlight (20% opacity) in its UPPER RIGHT quadrant, suggesting its smooth surface catching the light. These highlights are small, subtle, and add just enough dimensionality without being distracting.

Atmosphere & Environment: The weather is clear and sunny with excellent visibility. The time of day feels like mid-morning (approximately 10:00 AM), when light is bright but not harsh. The mood is energetic, optimistic, adventurous, and educational - immediately conveying excitement about learning and discovery. There are no environmental effects such as dust particles, haze, or atmospheric perspective fade. The air is crystal clear. The scene feels fresh, clean, and inviting. Temperature visually reads as comfortable - approximately 75°F / 24°C - suggested by the short-sleeve attire and outdoor comfort of the characters.
