## Story 2: Carotid Artery Stenosis - The Stroke Prevention Mystery

### Synopsis
The intern trio investigates why Mr. Rodriguez, a 68-year-old with transient vision loss, needs urgent carotid endarterectomy. They learn about atherosclerotic plaque, stroke risk stratification, and surgical decision-making.

### Characters
- **Camila** - Takes lead on patient history and risk assessment
- **Camilo** - Focuses on imaging interpretation (duplex ultrasound, CTA)
- **Diego** - Researches surgical vs. endovascular approaches
- **Dr. Erben** - Guides through decision-making process
- **Mr. Rodriguez** - Patient with 80% carotid stenosis

### Key Learning Points
- Atherosclerotic plaque morphology (vulnerable vs. stable)
- TIA (transient ischemic attack) significance
- Duplex ultrasound velocity criteria
- NASCET criteria for surgical indication
- Carotid endarterectomy vs. stenting
- Perioperative stroke prevention

8. Decision: Need to act fast but smart

**ACT 2: Investigation (Panels 9-16)**
9. Camila researches NASCET trial - when surgery helps
10. CTA shows ulcerated plaque - high embolic risk
11. Diego compares endarterectomy vs. stenting options
12. Dr. Erben presents to vascular surgery team
13. Surgical planning - exposure, shunt consideration
14. Discussion of neurologic monitoring during surgery
15. Patient education - Camila explains procedure
16. Mr. Rodriguez: "Will I be awake?" (regional anesthesia discussion)

**ACT 3: The Procedure (Panels 17-24)**
17. OR setup - neuromonitoring leads attached
18. Cervical block administered
19. Surgical exposure - finding the carotid bifurcation
20. Cross-clamping - team monitors neurologic status
21. Arteriotomy reveals "angry" yellow plaque
22. Plaque extraction - the culprit is out!
23. Closure with patch angioplasty
24. Immediate post-op neuro check - all intact!

**ACT 4: Success & Learning (Panels 25-32)**
25. Post-op day 1 - Mr. Rodriguez doing great
26. Pathology report: unstable plaque confirmed
27. Team reviews literature on stroke prevention
28. Long-term management: antiplatelet therapy, statin
29. Mr. Rodriguez thanks team: "You saved my brain!"
30. Dr. Erben's teaching moment: prevention is key
31. Camila, Camilo, Diego reflect on rapid decision-making
32. Preview: "Next case is calling..." (teaser for Story 3)

### Visual Style
- Same Dora-inspired style as Type 2 Endoleak
- Key visuals: carotid anatomy, ultrasound images, plaque cross-section
- Color coding: Red (danger/stenosis), Green (healthy blood flow), Yellow (plaque)

## Story 3: Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA) - The Silent Threat

### Synopsis  
A 72-year-old veteran's routine screening reveals a 6.2 cm AAA. The team must decide between open surgical repair and EVAR (endovascular aneurysm repair), considering anatomy, risk factors, and patient preference.

### Key Learning Points
- AAA natural history and rupture risk
- Screening guidelines (US Preventive Services Task Force)
- Anatomic suitability for EVAR (neck length, angulation, iliac access)
- Open repair vs. EVAR trade-offs
- Follow-up imaging protocols
- Endoleak surveillance

### Story Arc Highlights
- Discovery during routine ultrasound
- CT angiography reveals challenging anatomy
- Multidisciplinary discussion
- Patient preference: minimally invasive if possible
- EVAR procedure with intraoperative imaging
- Post-op complication: Type 1a endoleak requiring touch-up
- Long-term surveillance plan

## Story 4: Acute Limb Ischemia - Race Against Time

### Synopsis
3 AM call: 55-year-old woman with sudden onset "dead leg" - painful, pale, pulseless. The team has 6 hours to restore perfusion or risk amputation. Introduction to thromboembolectomy and the "6 Ps" of acute ischemia.

### Key Learning Points
- 6 Ps: Pain, Pallor, Pulselessness, Paresthesia, Paralysis, Poikilothermia
- Rutherford classification of acute limb ischemia
- Embolic vs. thrombotic causes
- Fogarty balloon thromboembolectomy
- Fasciotomy for compartment syndrome
- Reperfusion injury

### Story Arc Highlights
- Urgent consult - dramatic presentation
- Differential diagnosis: embolus from atrial fibrillation
- Anticoagulation started immediately  
- Rush to OR for embolectomy
- Successful clot extraction
- Post-op: monitoring for compartment syndrome
- Discussion of long-term anticoagulation

## Story 5: Diabetic Foot Ulcer & Bypass - Saving the Limb

### Synopsis
A 62-year-old with diabetes presents with non-healing foot ulcer and rest pain. The team learns about diabetic vasculopathy, angiography, and distal bypass techniques. Focus on limb salvage and quality of life.

### Key Learning Points
- Diabetic arterial disease patterns (tibial/pedal involvement)
- Ankle-brachial index (ABI) interpretation
- Angiography: roadmap for intervention
- Bypass options: fem-pop, fem-distal, pedal targets
- Wound care and healing predictors
- Multidisciplinary approach: vascular, podiatry, endocrine

### Story Arc Highlights
