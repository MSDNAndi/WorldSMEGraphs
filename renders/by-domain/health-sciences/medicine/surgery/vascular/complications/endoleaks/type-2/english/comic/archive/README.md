# Archive - Type 2 Endoleak Comic Image Generations

This directory contains archived versions of generated comic images from various iterations.

## Purpose

As we refine prompts and regenerate images, we archive previous versions here to:
- Maintain a history of image evolution
- Allow comparison between prompt strategies
- Preserve work for future reference
- Avoid losing previous generations to git history only

## Archive Structure

Each subdirectory represents a generation batch:

### 2026-01-07-original-pr36
- **Date**: Original from PR #36 (generated ~2026-01-06)
- **Prompt Style**: Short-form, STYLE BASE reference pattern
- **Issue**: Prompts were too brief, used placeholder references, lacked hyper-detailed specifications
- **Images**: 32 panels (image_001 through image_032)
- **Characteristics**: 
  - Prompts ~200-400 words each
  - Style consistency enforced via "Apply STYLE BASE" shorthand
  - Character descriptions compressed

## Next Iterations

Future archives should include:
- Timestamp/version identifier in folder name
- README or metadata file explaining what changed
- Comparison notes (what worked, what didn't)
- Prompt file used for generation
