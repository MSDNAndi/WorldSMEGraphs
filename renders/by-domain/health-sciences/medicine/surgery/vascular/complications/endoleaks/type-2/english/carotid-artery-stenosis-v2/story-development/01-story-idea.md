# Story Idea: Carotid Artery Stenosis - V2

## Core Concept
Dr. Yuna Erben, a petite Korean-American vascular surgeon in her 40s with expressive glasses, treats a patient experiencing transient ischemic attacks (TIAs). Through her multilingual background (Spanish from Venezuela, English, German, and Korean) and cultural sensitivity, she connects with diverse patients while demonstrating world-class surgical expertise in carotid endarterectomy.

## Protagonist
**Dr. Yuna Erben**
- **Ethnicity**: Korean
- **Background**: Grew up in Venezuela, multilingual
- **Physical**: Petite, 40s, expressive glasses
- **Languages**: Spanish (native fluency), English, German, Korean
- **Personality**: Warm, culturally sensitive, technically brilliant
- **Expertise**: Vascular surgery, particularly cerebrovascular disease

## Story Hook
A 67-year-old Venezuelan immigrant patient arrives at the hospital after experiencing temporary vision loss and slurred speech - classic TIA symptoms. Dr. Erben immediately connects with the patient in Spanish, establishing trust while rapidly evaluating the carotid stenosis that threatens a major stroke.

## Educational Goals
1. **Recognition of TIA symptoms** - "FAST" acronym (Face, Arms, Speech, Time)
2. **Carotid stenosis pathophysiology** - Atherosclerotic plaque formation
3. **Diagnostic workup** - Carotid duplex ultrasound, CTA, angiography
4. **NASCET criteria** - Quantifying stenosis severity (>70% = surgical candidate)
5. **Medical management** - Antiplatelet therapy, statin medication, risk factor modification
6. **Surgical decision-making** - When to operate vs. manage medically
7. **Carotid endarterectomy technique** - Step-by-step surgical procedure
8. **Perioperative care** - Blood pressure management, neuromonitoring
9. **Post-operative recovery** - Stroke prevention long-term
10. **Cultural competence** - Language barriers, trust-building, patient education

## Story Arc (30-40 panels estimated)

### Act 1: Recognition & Diagnosis (Panels 1-12)
- Panel 1: Patient arrives with family, describes symptoms in Spanish
- Panel 2: Dr. Erben takes history in Spanish, notices visual field deficits
- Panel 3: Physical exam - listening to carotid bruit (whooshing sound)
- Panel 4: FAST assessment demonstration with patient
- Panel 5: Dr. Erben explains TIA vs stroke risk in Spanish (drawing on whiteboard)
- Panel 6: Carotid duplex ultrasound procedure
- Panel 7: Ultrasound results showing severe stenosis (85% narrowing)
- Panel 8: CTA scan showing plaque details
- Panel 9: Dr. Erben consults with neurology team
- Panel 10: Family meeting - explaining stenosis with visual aids
- Panel 11: Discussion of treatment options (medical vs surgical)
- Panel 12: Shared decision-making with patient

### Act 2: Surgical Planning & Preparation (Panels 13-20)
- Panel 13: Pre-operative assessment - cardiac clearance, labs
- Panel 14: Dr. Erben reviews imaging in surgical planning room
- Panel 15: Anesthesia consultation - discussing neuromonitoring
- Panel 16: Patient education - showing anatomical models
- Panel 17: Consent process in Spanish with interpreter present
- Panel 18: Night before surgery - Dr. Erben reviews procedure steps
- Panel 19: Morning of surgery - patient preparation
- Panel 20: Dr. Erben scrubbing in, focused determination

### Act 3: Surgical Procedure (Panels 21-32)
- Panel 21: OR setup - sterile field, instruments laid out
- Panel 22: Patient positioning, neck exposure
- Panel 23: Skin incision along sternocleidomastoid muscle
- Panel 24: Careful dissection to expose carotid bifurcation
- Panel 25: Identifying internal/external carotid arteries
- Panel 26: Systemic heparinization before clamping
- Panel 27: Arteriotomy (opening the artery)
- Panel 28: Visualizing the atherosclerotic plaque
- Panel 29: Careful plaque removal (endarterectomy)
- Panel 30: Ensuring smooth intimal surface
- Panel 31: Patch angioplasty closure for wider lumen
- Panel 32: Final suturing, checking for leaks

### Act 4: Recovery & Prevention (Panels 33-40)
- Panel 33: Immediate post-op neurological assessment
- Panel 34: Blood pressure management in PACU
- Panel 35: Patient waking up, moving all extremities
- Panel 36: Dr. Erben explains success to family in Spanish
- Panel 37: Post-op day 1 - early mobilization
- Panel 38: Discharge education - medications (aspirin, statin)
- Panel 39: 2-week follow-up visit - wound healing, no stroke
- Panel 40: 3-month follow-up - carotid duplex showing patent artery, lifestyle changes discussion

## Cultural Elements to Incorporate
- **Language**: Spanish dialogue with patient/family (with English translations)
- **Trust**: Dr. Erben's shared cultural background helps patient comfort
- **Family dynamics**: Venezuelan family-centered decision making
- **Education**: Using visual aids accessible across language barriers
- **Respect**: Dr. Erben's humble demeanor despite expertise

## Medical Accuracy Requirements
- Correct anatomical terminology (common/internal/external carotid)
- Accurate NASCET measurement criteria (>70% stenosis)
- Proper surgical technique sequence
- Evidence-based guidelines (CREST trial, ACAS/ACST studies)
- Realistic complications monitoring (stroke, nerve injury, bleeding)

## Visual Style Requirements (Dora the Explorer inspired)
- Dr. Erben: Petite Asian woman, expressive rectangular glasses, black hair in practical ponytail
- Surgical scenes: Simplified anatomy with clear labels
- Bright colors: Scrubs (teal), blood vessels (red/blue), plaque (yellow/gray)
- Thick black outlines (3-4px)
- Expressive faces showing emotion
- Educational labels and arrows
- Landscape orientation (1536x1024)

## Length Justification
40 panels allows for:
- Deep character development of Dr. Erben
- Detailed patient interaction and trust-building
- Thorough surgical technique demonstration
- Cultural competence messaging
- Comprehensive patient education
- Long-term follow-up and prevention emphasis
- Not rushed, story-driven pacing
