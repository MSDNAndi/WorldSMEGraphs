**Status**: Design Complete, Ready for Implementation  
**Date**: 2026-01-07  
**Prepared by**: @pedagogy agent (WorldSMEGraphs)

## What Is This?

This directory contains a complete pedagogical redesign of the Type 2 Endoleak research comic, transforming it from linear fact-delivery into an emotionally engaging learning journey using evidence-based educational principles.

---

## The Problem

The current 32-panel comic is educational but not inspiring:
- ❌ Linear fact progression with no emotional arc
- ❌ Flat characters without development
- ❌ No challenges or obstacles
- ❌ Passive reader (no interaction)
- ❌ Missing emotional beats

**Result**: Readers learn facts but aren't inspired to pursue research.

---

## The Solution

Transform into a Hero's Journey for research:
- ✅ 8-beat story spine with emotional highs and lows
- ✅ Character development arcs (3 distinct personalities)
- ✅ Challenge-based learning (obstacles drive insights)
- ✅ Interactive elements (13 reader engagement prompts)
- ✅ Emotional scaffolding (transformation visible)

**Result**: Readers learn facts AND feel inspired to become researchers.
