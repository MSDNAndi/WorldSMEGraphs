# Comic Narrative Redesign: Executive Summary

**Project**: Type 2 Endoleak Research Comic Enhancement  
**Date**: 2026-01-07  
**Status**: Design Complete, Ready for Implementation  
**Prepared by**: @pedagogy agent

---

## Problem Statement

Current 32-panel comic about Type 2 endoleak research suffers from:
1. **Linear fact delivery** with no emotional journey
2. **Flat characters** without development arcs
3. **No challenges or obstacles** to drive engagement
4. **Missing interactive elements** (reader is passive)
5. **Unclear emotional beats** (flat enthusiasm throughout)

**Result**: Educational but not engaging; informative but not inspiring

---

## Solution Overview

Transform into emotionally engaging learning journey using:
- **8-beat story spine** (Hero's Journey for research)
- **Character growth arcs** (3 distinct personalities develop)
- **Challenge-based learning** (obstacles drive deeper understanding)
- **Interactive elements** (13 reader engagement prompts)
- **Emotional scaffolding** (4 peaks, 4 valleys, clear transformation)

**Result**: Educational AND inspiring; scientifically rigorous AND emotionally resonant

## Conclusion

This narrative redesign transforms the Type 2 Endoleak comic from a competent educational tool into an inspiring learning journey. By applying evidence-based pedagogical principles (8-beat story structure, character development, scaffolded learning, interactive engagement), we create an experience where research interns don't just learn ABOUT endoleaks—they experience becoming researchers.

**The difference**:
- Current: "Now I know about Type 2 endoleaks."
- Enhanced: "I can see myself doing research like this!"

That shift—from knowledge to inspiration—is the heart of this redesign.
