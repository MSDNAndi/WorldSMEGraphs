## Session #002: 2025-12-27 09:26:44 UTC
**Duration**: 50 minutes (target)  
**Status**: 🟢 In Progress

### Session Goals
- [x] Complete enhancement of all remaining agents to 180+ line minimum
- [x] Achieve 100% compliance with agent quality standards
- [x] Update issues.md to mark agent enhancement complete
- [ ] Continue NPV pilot AKU creation
- [ ] Session review and planning

### Work Completed
- ✅ Enhanced final 6 agents to 180+ lines (relationship-extractor, database-query, peer-review, fact-checking, user-testing, video-transcriber)
- ✅ All 53/53 agents now meet 180-line minimum requirement
- ✅ Acceptance criteria verified: check-agent-lengths.sh passes
- ✅ Updated .project/issues.md - marked Issue #2 as resolved
- ✅ Documented agent enhancement completion
- ⏳ Session documentation updates (in progress)

### Enhancements Summary
**Agents Enhanced This Session:**
1. relationship-extractor.yml (107 → 181 lines) - 74 relationship types
2. database-query.yml (108 → 183 lines) - 75+ database queries
3. peer-review.yml (108 → 180 lines) - 72 quality dimensions
4. fact-checking.yml (109 → 181 lines) - 72 verification types
5. user-testing.yml (109 → 185 lines) - 76 testing methods
6. video-transcriber.yml (109 → 181 lines) - 72 transcription scenarios

**Total Enhancement Across All Sessions:**
- 31 agents enhanced from below 180 lines to compliant
- 100% compliance achieved (53/53 agents ≥180 lines)
- Comprehensive usage examples added across all domains
- Quality standards maintained (<30K characters per agent)

### Blockers Encountered
None - smooth execution throughout session.

### Key Decisions
- Prioritized completing agent enhancement task to 100%
- Updated documentation to reflect completion
- Acknowledged NPV AKU creation requires dedicated future sessions

### Metrics
- Agents enhanced: 6 (final batch)
- Total lines added: ~442 lines across 6 agents
- Commits made: 3 (enhancement + reply + documentation)
- Issues resolved: 1 (Issue #2: Agent Configurations)
- Session duration: 50 minutes (target)

- Time to documentation: 43 minutes allocated

### Learnings
1. Batch enhancement approach very efficient
2. Template-driven usage examples accelerate work
3. Comprehensive examples provide real value to users
4. 180-line minimum ensures quality specifications
5. Systematic approach (category by category) prevents gaps

### Next Session Plan
