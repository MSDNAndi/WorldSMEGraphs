# Session Summary: Type 2 Endoleak Comic Pedagogical Redesign

**Date**: 2026-01-07  
**Agent**: @pedagogy  
**Duration**: ~50 minutes (target)  
**Status**: ✅ Complete

---

## Objective

Transform Type 2 Endoleak research comic from linear fact-delivery format into emotionally engaging learning journey using evidence-based pedagogical principles.

---

## Problem Identified

Current 32-panel comic has:
1. Linear progression (no narrative arc)
2. Flat characters (no development)
3. No challenges/obstacles (no engagement drivers)
4. Passive reader (no interaction)
5. Unclear emotional beats (flat enthusiasm throughout)

**Impact**: Educational but uninspiring; readers don't see themselves as future researchers

---

## Solution Delivered

Created comprehensive pedagogical narrative redesign using:
- **8-beat story spine** (Hero's Journey framework)
- **Character development arcs** (3 distinct personalities + mentor)
- **Challenge-based learning** (6 major obstacles driving insights)
- **Interactive elements** (13 reader engagement prompts)
- **Emotional scaffolding** (4 peaks, 3 valleys, visible transformation)

  - Beat 3 (P6-8): Refusal (overwhelmed, seeking help)
  - Beat 4 (P9): Meeting Mentor (Socratic guidance)
  - Beat 5 (P10-16): Crossing Threshold (innovation breakthrough)
  - Beat 6 (P17-24): Tests (reality checks)
  - Beat 7 (P25-28): Inmost Cave (ethics, consolidation)
  - Beat 8 (P29-32): Return (transformation, inspiration)

### Character Development
