Teddy the Bear has a problem!

His old toy car is broken. 🚗💔

**Option 1:** Fix old car
- Costs: 5 pennies
- Works for: 1 more day
- Then breaks again!

**Option 2:** Buy NEW car
- Costs: 20 pennies TODAY
- Works for: MANY days!
- Super shiny! ✨

**Story Time!**

You have a piggy bank. 🐷

Put 10 pennies in piggy bank TODAY.

Piggy bank is MAGIC! ✨

Tomorrow, piggy bank has 11 pennies! (Magic gave you 1 more!)

**Question:** Do you want 10 pennies now or wait for 11 pennies tomorrow?

**If you wait:** You get MORE cookies later! 🍪🍪

Both are good! You choose! 😊

## Big and Small 📏

**BIG money today** = Can do LOTS today!

**Small money tomorrow** = Have to wait... wait... wait...

**Example:**

- OR "6 toys NEXT WEEK" 🎁🎁🎁🎁🎁🎁

You say: "5 toys TODAY please!"

Why? Because:
1. You can PLAY today! 🎮
2. Next week is sooo far! 😴
3. Today is NOW! 🌟

Hmm... BIG candy sounds good! Some kids wait! 💭

**The Rule:** If waiting gets you MUCH MORE, maybe wait is okay! ⏰

## Parent's Note 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦

**What This Teaches:**

This story introduces the fundamental concept of **time value of money** (NPV) at a toddler-appropriate level through:

- **Immediate gratification vs. delayed rewards** - Basic intertemporal choice
- **Quantity comparison** - Foundation for value assessment  
- **Opportunity cost** - Simple trade-offs (toy now vs. two toys later)
- **Present bias** - Natural preference for immediate rewards
- **Counting and comparison** - Pre-math skills

**Key Learning Outcome:** Understanding that "when" you get something matters, not just "what" you get - the foundational insight behind discounted cash flow analysis.

**The End!** 🎈

*Good job learning about money and cookies! Now... who wants a cookie?* 🍪😊
