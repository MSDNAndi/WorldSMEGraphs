      "text": "International NPV analysis must account for currency exchange rates, country-specific risks, different tax regimes, and capital market segmentation, leading to more complex valuation approaches.",
      "formal": "NPV can be calculated in foreign currency and converted, or by converting all cash flows to home currency first"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "When investing abroad, you face all the normal project risks plus additional complications: What if the currency moves? What if the government changes policies? What tax rate applies? International NPV must capture all these factors.",
      "key_insight": "There are two equivalent approaches: (1) discount foreign-currency cash flows at foreign-currency discount rate, then convert at spot rate, or (2) convert cash flows to home currency using forward rates, then discount at home-currency rate. Both should give the same answer if markets are efficient.",
      "technical_details": "The interest rate parity relationship links forward rates to interest rate differentials. Country risk can be addressed through adjusted discount rates or probability-weighted scenario analysis. Transfer pricing and blocked funds add complexity.",
      "common_misconceptions": [
        "Use today's exchange rate for all future cash flows - use forward rates or scenario analysis",
        "Higher interest rates abroad mean higher required returns - parity relationships often explain this",
        "Country risk premium can simply be added to WACC - different risks may require different adjustments"
