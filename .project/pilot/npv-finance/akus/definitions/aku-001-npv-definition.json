  "content": {
    "statement": {
      "text": "Net Present Value (NPV) is the difference between the present value of cash inflows and the present value of cash outflows over a period of time, used to analyze the profitability of a projected investment or project.",
      "formal": "NPV = Σ(CFₜ / (1+r)^t) - C₀, where CFₜ are cash flows at time t, r is discount rate, C₀ is initial investment"
    },
    
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "NPV answers the question: If I invest money today, how much value (in today's dollars) will I create or destroy? A positive NPV means the investment creates value; a negative NPV means it destroys value.",
      
      "key_insight": "NPV explicitly accounts for the time value of money - a dollar today is worth more than a dollar tomorrow because it can be invested to earn returns. This makes NPV superior to simple payback period or accounting rate of return.",
      
      "technical_details": "The discount rate 'r' typically represents the opportunity cost of capital - the return that could be earned on an alternative investment of equivalent risk. The initial investment C₀ is considered at time zero, so it's not discounted.",
      
      "common_misconceptions": [
        "NPV is not the same as profit - it's the present value of future cash flows",
        "A high NPV doesn't mean high profitability rate (use IRR or profitability index for that)",
        "NPV assumes cash flows can be reinvested at the discount rate"
      ]

    "definitions_glossary": {
      "present_value": "The current value of a future sum of money or stream of cash flows given a specified rate of return",
      "cash_flow": "The net amount of cash being transferred into and out of a business or project",
      "discount_rate": "The rate of return used to discount future cash flows back to their present value",
