      "text": "Future Value (FV) is the value of a current asset at a specified date in the future based on an assumed rate of growth over time. It represents the amount to which an investment will grow after earning interest over a given period.",
      "formal": "FV = PV × (1+r)^n, where PV is present value, r is the periodic interest rate, and n is the number of compounding periods"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Future value answers the question: 'If I invest this money today, how much will I have at some future point?' It's like watching your savings account grow over time as interest compounds on your balance.",
      "key_insight": "The power of compounding means that future value grows exponentially, not linearly, with time. This is why Albert Einstein allegedly called compound interest 'the eighth wonder of the world.' Small differences in interest rates or time horizons can lead to dramatically different outcomes.",
      "technical_details": "The future value calculation assumes a constant periodic rate and regular compounding. For continuous compounding, FV = PV × e^(rt). For irregular cash flows, each must be compounded separately. The compound annual growth rate (CAGR) can be derived from FV and PV: CAGR = (FV/PV)^(1/n) - 1.",
      "common_misconceptions": [
        "Simple interest and compound interest give similar results - for long periods, compound interest yields significantly higher future values",
        "Doubling the time doubles the future value - due to exponential growth, doubling time more than doubles FV",
        "FV calculations don't apply to declining assets - negative growth rates work the same way mathematically"
