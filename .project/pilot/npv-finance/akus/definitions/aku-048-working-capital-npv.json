    "statement": {
      "text": "Changes in net working capital (NWC) are cash flows in NPV analysis: increases in NWC represent cash outflows (investment), while decreases represent cash inflows. At project end, working capital is typically recovered.",
      "formal": "ΔCF from NWC = -ΔNWC = -(ΔCA - ΔCL), where CA is current assets, CL is current liabilities"

    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "When a business grows, it needs more inventory and gives more credit to customers. This ties up cash - money sitting in a warehouse or owed by customers isn't available for other uses. NPV analysis must capture this investment.",
      "key_insight": "Working capital is an investment that typically reverses at project end. A project requiring $1M in NWC at start will likely recover that $1M when it concludes as inventory is sold and receivables collected.",
      "technical_details": "Net working capital = Current Assets - Current Liabilities. For NPV, focus on operating working capital: Inventory + Accounts Receivable - Accounts Payable. Cash holdings are typically excluded as they're part of treasury management.",
      "common_misconceptions": [
        "Working capital is only an initial investment - it changes year-to-year with sales growth",
        "Working capital costs nothing - it has opportunity cost (tied-up capital earns nothing)",
        "Negative working capital is always bad - it can be efficient (e.g., retail) and reduces investment"
