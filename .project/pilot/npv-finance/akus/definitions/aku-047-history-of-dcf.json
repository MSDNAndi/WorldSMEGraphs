    "statement": {
      "text": "Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis and Net Present Value (NPV) have roots stretching back centuries, but were formalized in the early 20th century. Irving Fisher's 1930 work 'The Theory of Interest' provided the theoretical foundation, while John Burr Williams' 1938 'The Theory of Investment Value' applied these concepts to stock valuation. By the 1960s, DCF had become standard practice in corporate finance."
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Before DCF, investment decisions were often made on gut feeling, accounting profits, or simple payback. The development of present value mathematics gave managers a rigorous way to compare investments across time - answering 'is $100 today worth more than $110 next year?' with mathematical precision.",
      "key_insight": "The transition from intuitive to quantitative investment analysis was gradual. While the mathematics of compound interest was known for centuries (even to ancient Babylonians), applying it systematically to investment decisions required both theoretical development and computational tools. The spreadsheet revolution of the 1980s finally made DCF accessible to all practitioners.",
      "technical_details": "Key milestones: 1930 - Fisher formalizes time value of money and investment theory. 1938 - Williams applies PV to stock valuation (foundation of DDM). 1951 - Joel Dean advocates DCF for capital budgeting. 1958 - Modigliani-Miller shows capital structure affects firm value. 1964 - CAPM provides framework for risk-adjusted rates. 1970s - NPV becomes standard in MBA programs. 1980s - VisiCalc/Lotus 1-2-3 democratize DCF analysis."
