    "statement": {
      "text": "A depreciation tax shield is the reduction in income taxes that results from being allowed to deduct depreciation expense, creating a cash flow benefit equal to depreciation multiplied by the tax rate.",
      "formal": "Tax Shield = Depreciation × Tax Rate, or TS = D × T_c"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Depreciation reduces reported income, which reduces taxes owed. Although depreciation is a non-cash expense, the tax savings it creates is very real cash that stays in the company.",
      "key_insight": "In NPV analysis, depreciation affects cash flows indirectly through taxes. The depreciation tax shield must be added back to calculate true cash flows from operations.",
      "technical_details": "The tax shield depends on the depreciation method (straight-line vs. accelerated), the asset's useful life, and the applicable tax rate. Accelerated depreciation (like MACRS in the US) provides larger tax shields in early years, increasing NPV due to the time value of money.",
      "common_misconceptions": [
        "Depreciation is a cash expense - it's not, only the tax benefit creates cash flow",
        "All depreciation methods yield the same NPV - accelerated methods increase NPV",
