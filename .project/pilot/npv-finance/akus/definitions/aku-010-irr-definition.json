    "statement": {
      "text": "Internal Rate of Return (IRR) is the discount rate that makes the Net Present Value (NPV) of all cash flows from a project equal to zero. It represents the project's intrinsic rate of return, and a project is considered acceptable if its IRR exceeds the required rate of return (cost of capital).",
      "formal": "IRR is the rate r such that: NPV = Σ(CFₜ / (1+r)^t) = 0, or equivalently: Σ(CFₜ / (1+IRR)^t) = 0"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "IRR answers the question: 'What percentage return does this project earn?' If you invest $100 and get back $110 after one year, your IRR is 10%. For multi-year projects with varying cash flows, IRR is the single rate that makes all the inflows exactly offset the initial outflows when discounted.",
      "key_insight": "IRR is useful because it's expressed as a percentage return, which is intuitive for managers and comparable across projects. The decision rule is simple: if IRR > cost of capital, accept the project. However, IRR has limitations: it can have multiple values for non-conventional cash flows, and it implicitly assumes reinvestment at the IRR rate rather than the cost of capital.",
      "technical_details": "IRR cannot be solved algebraically except for simple cases; numerical methods (Newton-Raphson, bisection) are required. For a single-period investment, IRR = (FV/PV) - 1. For conventional cash flows (one sign change), a unique IRR exists. For non-conventional cash flows, there can be zero, one, or multiple IRRs equal to the number of sign changes (Descartes' rule).",
      "common_misconceptions": [
        "IRR is the actual return earned - only true if interim cash flows are reinvested at the IRR",
        "Higher IRR always means better project - not true for mutually exclusive projects",
        "Every project has an IRR - non-conventional cash flows may have multiple or no IRRs",
        "IRR and NPV always agree - they can conflict for mutually exclusive projects or non-conventional cash flows"
      ]
    },

      "hurdle_rate": "The minimum acceptable rate of return required by investors, often the cost of capital",
