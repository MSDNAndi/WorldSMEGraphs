      "text": "Corporate investment decisions apply NPV and related tools to evaluate major expenditures such as capacity expansion, new facilities, technology upgrades, and strategic initiatives. These decisions follow a structured process from proposal to post-implementation review."
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "When a company considers building a new factory or launching a product line, it's essentially asking: 'Will this investment create value for shareholders?' NPV provides the framework to answer this question systematically, comparing the value of expected benefits to the cost of the investment.",
      "key_insight": "Corporate investment decisions are the primary way firms allocate capital and shape their future. The quality of these decisions directly impacts shareholder value, competitive position, and long-term survival. That's why large companies have formal capital budgeting processes with multiple levels of review.",
      "technical_details": "A typical corporate investment decision process: (1) Proposal generation - business units identify opportunities, (2) Initial screening - rough NPV, strategic fit check, (3) Detailed analysis - rigorous cash flow forecasting, risk assessment, (4) Approval process - investment committee review, (5) Implementation - execution and monitoring, (6) Post-audit - actual vs. projected performance."
