      "text": "The cost of equity is the rate of return required by equity investors to compensate for the systematic risk of their investment, commonly estimated using the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM).",
      "formal": "r_e = r_f + β × (r_m - r_f), where r_f is risk-free rate, β is systematic risk, (r_m - r_f) is market risk premium"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Equity investors give up the certainty of a risk-free investment and take on risk. They require compensation for this risk - the higher the risk, the higher the required return. Cost of equity is what investors demand for bearing the stock's systematic risk.",
      "key_insight": "Only systematic (market) risk is priced because diversified investors can eliminate company-specific risk. A company with higher beta has higher cost of equity because its returns are more volatile in line with the market.",
      "technical_details": "CAPM is the most common approach, but alternatives include the Dividend Discount Model (r_e = D₁/P₀ + g), Fama-French three-factor model, and build-up method. Each has advantages depending on data availability and company characteristics.",
      "common_misconceptions": [
        "Cost of equity equals dividend yield - it also includes expected capital appreciation",
        "Lower beta is always better - it means lower return requirement but also lower expected returns",
        "Historical beta predicts future beta - betas change over time with company risk profile"
