    "statement": {
      "text": "Capital Budgeting is the process by which a firm determines and evaluates potential large-scale expenditures or investments. These are typically long-term investments in fixed assets such as property, plant, equipment, new product lines, research and development, or acquisitions that are expected to generate cash flows over multiple years.",
      "formal": "Capital budgeting involves analyzing expected cash flows (CF₁, CF₂, ..., CFₙ), determining appropriate discount rate (r), and applying decision criteria (NPV > 0, IRR > r, PI > 1)"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Capital budgeting is like deciding whether to buy a house. You estimate the benefits (rental income, appreciation), costs (mortgage, maintenance), timing of cash flows, and compare to alternatives. Companies do the same for factories, equipment, and major projects.",
      "key_insight": "Capital budgeting decisions are among the most critical a firm makes because: (1) they involve large sums of money, (2) they are largely irreversible, (3) they define the firm's strategic direction, and (4) they determine the firm's future risk and return profile. A single bad capital budgeting decision can bankrupt a company.",
      "technical_details": "The capital budgeting process typically involves: (1) identifying investment opportunities, (2) estimating incremental cash flows, (3) determining the cost of capital, (4) applying decision criteria (NPV, IRR, Payback, PI), (5) making the investment decision, and (6) post-audit and performance review. Incremental cash flows include initial investment, operating cash flows, and terminal cash flows.",
      "common_misconceptions": [
        "Capital budgeting is only about choosing between projects - it also includes timing decisions (now vs. later) and abandonment decisions",
        "Accounting profits equal cash flows - capital budgeting uses cash flows, which differ from accounting profits due to depreciation, working capital, etc.",
        "The highest NPV project is always the best choice - capital rationing and strategic considerations may lead to different choices"
