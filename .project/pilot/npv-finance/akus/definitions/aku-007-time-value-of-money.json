    "statement": {
      "text": "The Time Value of Money (TVM) is a fundamental financial principle stating that a sum of money is worth more now than the same sum will be at a future date due to its potential earning capacity. This core principle underlies all of finance and forms the basis for discounted cash flow analysis, bond pricing, and investment valuation.",
      "formal": "PV = FV / (1+r)^n, where PV is present value, FV is future value, r is the interest rate, and n is the number of periods"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Money available today is worth more than the identical sum in the future because you can invest it and earn interest. A dollar today can be invested to become more than a dollar tomorrow. This opportunity cost of delayed receipt is the essence of time value of money.",
      "key_insight": "The time value of money exists for three fundamental reasons: (1) opportunity cost - money can be invested to earn returns, (2) inflation - purchasing power typically decreases over time, and (3) risk - future cash flows are uncertain. Even in a world without inflation or risk, time value would exist due to opportunity cost alone.",
      "technical_details": "TVM calculations involve moving cash flows forward (compounding) or backward (discounting) through time. Compounding calculates future value: FV = PV × (1+r)^n. Discounting calculates present value: PV = FV / (1+r)^n. The discount rate (r) reflects the opportunity cost of capital and may incorporate risk premiums.",
      "common_misconceptions": [
        "TVM is just about inflation - while inflation reduces purchasing power, TVM exists even without inflation due to opportunity cost",
        "All future money is worth less - with negative interest rates (rare), future money could theoretically be worth more",
        "The discount rate is always the interest rate - the appropriate rate depends on risk and opportunity cost, not just market rates"
