      "text": "Terminal value represents the present value of all future cash flows beyond the explicit forecast period in a DCF valuation, typically calculated using either the perpetuity growth method or exit multiple method.",

    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Since we cannot forecast cash flows indefinitely, we use terminal value to capture all value creation beyond our explicit forecast period. It often represents 60-80% of a company's total value.",
      "key_insight": "Terminal value sensitivity to growth rate and discount rate assumptions makes it crucial to use realistic, sustainable assumptions. Small changes in these inputs can dramatically affect the valuation.",
      "technical_details": "The perpetuity growth method assumes cash flows grow at a constant rate forever. This rate should not exceed long-term GDP growth. The exit multiple method assumes the asset is sold at the end of the forecast period at a typical industry multiple.",
      "common_misconceptions": [
        "High terminal value means the model is wrong - it often legitimately represents most of firm value",
        "Terminal growth rate can equal expected short-term growth - it must be sustainable long-term",
        "Terminal value is arbitrary - it requires careful analysis of industry dynamics"
