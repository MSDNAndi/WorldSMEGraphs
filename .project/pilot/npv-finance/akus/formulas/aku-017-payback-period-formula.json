    "statement": {
      "text": "The Payback Period is the length of time required for an investment to recover its initial cost from the cash inflows it generates. While theoretically inferior to NPV (it ignores time value and post-payback cash flows), it remains popular in practice as a simple risk and liquidity measure.",
      "formal": "Payback Period = Number of years before cumulative cash flows equal initial investment"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "How long until I get my money back? The payback period answers this simple question. If you invest $100,000 and generate $25,000 per year, payback is 4 years.",
      "key_insight": "Payback is popular despite its flaws because it's easy to understand and captures liquidity risk. Shorter payback means faster recovery and lower risk of project failure. However, it ignores the time value of money and all cash flows after payback.",
      "technical_details": "Simple payback ignores TVM. Discounted payback period addresses this by using discounted cash flows. Even so, both ignore post-payback cash flows. The Graham-Harvey survey found 57% of CFOs 'always or almost always' use payback, showing its persistent popularity."
