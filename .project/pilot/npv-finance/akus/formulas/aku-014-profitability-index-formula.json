    "statement": {
      "text": "The Profitability Index (PI) is the ratio of the present value of future cash flows to the initial investment. It measures the value created per dollar invested and is particularly useful for project ranking when capital is limited (capital rationing).",
      "formal": "PI = PV of Future Cash Flows / Initial Investment = (NPV + C₀) / C₀ = 1 + NPV/C₀"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "If you invest $1 and the PI is 1.25, you're getting $1.25 in present value for every $1 invested - creating $0.25 of value per dollar. This makes PI useful for comparing projects of different sizes when you can't fund them all.",
      "key_insight": "PI is directly related to NPV: PI = 1 + NPV/Investment. A PI > 1 means positive NPV. The advantage of PI over NPV is that it's scale-independent, making it ideal for capital rationing situations where you need to maximize value per dollar deployed.",
      "technical_details": "Decision rule: Accept if PI > 1 (equivalent to NPV > 0). For mutually exclusive projects of equal size, NPV and PI give the same ranking. For different sizes, PI may disagree with NPV - in that case, NPV is preferred unless capital is constrained.",
      "common_misconceptions": [
        "Higher PI always means better project - only true under capital rationing",
        "PI and NPV always agree - they can disagree for mutually exclusive projects of different sizes",
        "PI < 1 means project loses money - it means NPV is negative (value destruction)"
