    "statement": {
      "text": "NPV analysis must maintain consistency between cash flow type (real or nominal) and discount rate type. The Fisher equation relates nominal and real rates: (1 + nominal) = (1 + real) × (1 + inflation).",
      "formal": "(1 + r_nominal) = (1 + r_real) × (1 + π), where π is expected inflation rate"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Inflation erodes purchasing power over time. When forecasting cash flows, you can either work in 'today's dollars' (real) or 'future dollars' (nominal), but you must match your discount rate to your cash flow type.",
      "key_insight": "The critical rule is consistency: nominal cash flows must be discounted at nominal rates, real cash flows at real rates. Mixing them produces incorrect NPV calculations.",
      "technical_details": "Nominal cash flows include inflation in their growth projections. Real cash flows assume constant purchasing power. The real discount rate is approximately the nominal rate minus expected inflation, but the exact relationship is given by the Fisher equation.",
      "common_misconceptions": [
        "You can use any discount rate with any cash flow - mixing real and nominal leads to errors",
        "Real and nominal approaches give different NPVs - they give the same NPV when applied correctly",
        "Inflation effects are negligible - at 3% inflation, purchasing power halves in 24 years"
