    "statement": {
      "text": "The Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) is the rate a company is expected to pay on average to all its security holders to finance its assets. It represents the minimum return that a company must earn on an existing asset base to satisfy its creditors, owners, and other capital providers.",
      "formal": "WACC = (E/V) × rₑ + (D/V) × rᵈ × (1-T), where E = market value of equity, D = market value of debt, V = E+D, rₑ = cost of equity, rᵈ = cost of debt, T = tax rate"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "WACC is like the blended interest rate a company pays on all its financing. If you borrow some money at 5% and get some from investors who expect 12%, your overall cost is somewhere in between, weighted by how much of each you use.",
      "key_insight": "WACC is the appropriate discount rate for evaluating projects with similar risk to the company's existing operations. The tax shield on debt (1-T term) reflects that interest payments are tax-deductible, making debt cheaper than its stated rate. This is why many companies use some debt financing.",
      "technical_details": "The cost of equity (rₑ) is typically estimated using CAPM: rₑ = rᶠ + β(rₘ - rᶠ). The cost of debt (rᵈ) is the yield on the company's bonds or its borrowing rate. Market values, not book values, should be used for weights. WACC assumes a constant capital structure.",
      "common_misconceptions": [
        "Book values should be used - market values are correct",
        "WACC is constant over time - it changes with capital structure and market conditions",
        "WACC applies to all projects - only for projects with similar risk to the firm",
        "Higher debt always lowers WACC - true only to a point before distress costs dominate"
