    "statement": {
      "text": "A Perpetuity is a stream of equal payments that continues forever. The present value of a perpetuity is remarkably simple: PV = C/r, where C is the constant payment and r is the discount rate. This formula is fundamental to valuing stocks (via dividend discount model) and terminal values in DCF analysis.",
      "formal": "PV_perpetuity = C / r, and for growing perpetuity: PV = C / (r - g), where g is the constant growth rate and r > g"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "How can an infinite stream have a finite value? The answer lies in discounting - payments far in the future become vanishingly small in present value terms. After about 50-100 years at typical discount rates, additional payments add essentially nothing to the total value.",
      "key_insight": "The perpetuity formula is the limit of the annuity formula as n → ∞: as (1+r)^(-n) → 0, PVA = C × [1-(1+r)^(-n)]/r → C/r. This elegant result is widely used: a stock paying constant dividends forever is worth Dividend/r. A project with perpetual cash flows has terminal value = CF/r.",
      "technical_details": "The growing perpetuity formula PV = C/(r-g) requires r > g for convergence. This is also known as the Gordon Growth Model when applied to dividends. If g = 0, it reduces to the simple perpetuity. Historical examples include British Consols (perpetual bonds) and preferred stock with fixed dividends.",
      "common_misconceptions": [
        "Perpetuities can't have finite value - they do because of discounting",
        "Nothing lasts forever so the formula is useless - it's an approximation for very long-lived assets",
        "Growing perpetuity works for any g - only if r > g, otherwise the series diverges"
