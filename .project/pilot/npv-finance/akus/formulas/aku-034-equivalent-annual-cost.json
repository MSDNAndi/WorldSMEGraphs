    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "When comparing equipment with different lifespans, we can't just compare total costs - a machine lasting 10 years will obviously cost more than one lasting 5 years. EAC puts costs on an 'annual rental' basis for fair comparison.",
      "key_insight": "EAC assumes projects can be repeated indefinitely. It's most appropriate for projects that will be replaced with similar alternatives when they end. For one-time projects, use adjusted present value methods instead.",
      "technical_details": "EAC is calculated by finding the annuity payment that has the same present value as the project's total costs. The project with the lower EAC is preferred, assuming revenues are the same or analyzed separately.",
      "common_misconceptions": [
        "Higher upfront cost means higher EAC - not if the asset lasts longer or has lower operating costs",
        "EAC comparison works for all projects - only valid when projects are repeatable",
        "Revenues don't matter for EAC - they should be analyzed alongside or netted against costs"
