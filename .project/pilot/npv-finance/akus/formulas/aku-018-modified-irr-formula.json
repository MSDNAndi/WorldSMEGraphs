      "text": "Modified Internal Rate of Return (MIRR) addresses the reinvestment rate assumption problem of traditional IRR. MIRR assumes reinvestment at the cost of capital (a more realistic assumption) and calculates the return that equates the present value of outlays to the future value of inflows.",
      "formal": "MIRR = (FV of inflows at reinvestment rate / PV of outflows at finance rate)^(1/n) - 1"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "IRR implicitly assumes you can reinvest interim cash flows at the IRR rate, which is often unrealistic (if a project has 50% IRR, can you really reinvest at 50%?). MIRR fixes this by assuming reinvestment at a more realistic rate - typically the cost of capital.",
      "key_insight": "MIRR gives a unique answer even for non-conventional cash flows (where traditional IRR may have multiple solutions) and provides a more realistic return measure. It's especially useful when comparing projects with different cash flow timings.",
      "technical_details": "MIRR calculation: (1) Compound all positive cash flows to end of project at reinvestment rate, (2) Discount all negative cash flows to time 0 at finance rate, (3) Calculate the rate that equates PV of negatives to FV of positives. In Excel: =MIRR(cash_flows, finance_rate, reinvest_rate)."
