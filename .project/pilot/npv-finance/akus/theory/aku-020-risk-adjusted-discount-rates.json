    "statement": {
      "text": "Risk-Adjusted Discount Rates reflect the principle that higher-risk projects require higher expected returns. Rather than using the company's overall WACC for all projects, the discount rate should be adjusted based on the specific risk characteristics of each project. This ensures that NPV analysis properly values risky cash flows.",
      "formal": "Risk-Adjusted Rate = Risk-free Rate + β_project × (Market Premium) = rᶠ + β × (rₘ - rᶠ)"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Would you accept the same return for a guaranteed government bond and a speculative startup investment? Of course not - you'd demand higher returns for taking more risk. The same logic applies to corporate projects: a risky R&D project should be evaluated with a higher discount rate than a routine equipment replacement.",
      "key_insight": "Using a single company-wide discount rate for all projects leads to systematic errors: it overvalues high-risk projects (their discount rate is too low) and undervalues low-risk projects (their discount rate is too high). This 'accept the risky, reject the safe' bias can destroy shareholder value over time.",
      "technical_details": "Project-specific rates can be estimated using: (1) Pure play method - find comparable firms with similar risk, (2) Subjective adjustment - add premium to WACC based on judgment, (3) CAPM-based - estimate project beta from comparable assets. The beta should reflect the systematic risk of the project's cash flows, not the company's overall beta.",
      "common_misconceptions": [
        "WACC is appropriate for all projects - only for average-risk projects",
        "Higher risk always means higher discount rate - only systematic (undiversifiable) risk matters",
        "Project risk equals company risk - projects can be much riskier or safer than the company average",
        "Certainty equivalent method gives different answers - mathematically equivalent if done correctly"
