    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Managers are people with their own interests - job security, power, prestige, bonuses. Sometimes these interests align with shareholders' goal of maximizing value, but sometimes they don't. This misalignment creates agency costs.",
      "key_insight": "A project with positive NPV might still be rejected if it threatens managers' positions, or a negative NPV project might be accepted if it increases managers' power or compensation.",
      "technical_details": "Agency theory predicts managers may overinvest (empire building) when they benefit from controlling more assets, or underinvest in risky projects when they bear career risk but don't share proportionally in success. Governance mechanisms like incentive compensation, monitoring, and capital budgeting controls can reduce but not eliminate agency costs.",
      "common_misconceptions": [
        "Good managers don't have agency conflicts - all humans have self-interest",
        "Stock options perfectly align interests - they can encourage excessive risk-taking",
