    "statement": {
      "text": "NPV analysis must use incremental cash flows - the additional cash flows that occur only because of the investment decision. This requires identifying and including opportunity costs, externalities (synergies and cannibalization), and excluding sunk costs."
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "When evaluating a project, ask: 'What cash flows change if we do this project versus if we don't?' Only those changes matter for the decision. Money already spent (sunk costs) doesn't change, so it's irrelevant. Opportunity costs are real costs even if no check is written.",
      "key_insight": "The hardest part of capital budgeting isn't the math - it's correctly identifying which cash flows to include. The three key principles are: (1) Ignore sunk costs, (2) Include opportunity costs, (3) Include side effects (cannibalization, synergies).",
      "technical_details": "Incremental cash flow = CF(with project) - CF(without project). This 'with/without' principle applies to every line item. For example, if a new product reduces sales of an existing product (cannibalization), that lost revenue is an incremental cost of the new project."
