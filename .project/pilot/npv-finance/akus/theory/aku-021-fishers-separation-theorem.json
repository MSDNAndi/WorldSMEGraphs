    "statement": {
      "text": "Fisher's Separation Theorem states that in perfect capital markets, the firm's investment decision (which projects to accept) can be separated from shareholders' consumption preferences. All shareholders will agree on maximizing NPV regardless of their individual preferences for current vs. future consumption.",
      "formal": "Investment decision rule: Accept all NPV > 0 projects, independent of shareholder utility functions, if capital markets are perfect"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Even if some shareholders want dividends now and others want long-term growth, they all benefit from the firm accepting positive NPV projects. Why? Because shareholders can borrow or lend in capital markets to achieve their preferred consumption timing. The firm should just maximize value; shareholders can then adjust their consumption patterns through personal borrowing and lending.",
      "key_insight": "This theorem provides the theoretical justification for NPV maximization as the corporate objective. Without it, we'd need to know each shareholder's preferences. The separation allows managers to focus on creating value without worrying about who the shareholders are or what they want to do with the money.",
      "technical_details": "The theorem requires: (1) perfect capital markets - borrowing/lending at same rate, (2) no taxes or transaction costs, (3) no information asymmetry. When these conditions are violated (as they always are in practice to some degree), the separation may not hold perfectly, but remains a useful first approximation."
