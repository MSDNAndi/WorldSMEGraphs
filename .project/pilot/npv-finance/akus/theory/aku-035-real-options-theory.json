    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Traditional NPV assumes you make one decision and stick with it. Real options recognize that managers can change course - wait for more information, expand if successful, or abandon if things go poorly. This flexibility has value.",
      "key_insight": "Projects with embedded options (flexibility) may be worthwhile even if their static NPV is slightly negative, because the option value more than compensates for the expected losses.",
      "technical_details": "Real options are valued using option pricing techniques adapted from financial options (Black-Scholes, binomial trees). Key inputs include the underlying asset value, exercise price, time to expiration, volatility, and risk-free rate.",

        "Real options always make projects more valuable - some options have little value",
        "Static NPV is always wrong - for stable projects with no flexibility, it's sufficient",
