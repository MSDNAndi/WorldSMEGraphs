    "statement": {
      "text": "Opportunity Cost is the value of the next-best alternative foregone when making a choice. It represents what must be given up when scarce resources are used for one purpose rather than another. This concept is fundamental to economics and rational decision-making, capturing the true cost of any decision beyond just monetary expenditure.",
      "formal": "Opportunity Cost of Choice A = Value of Best Alternative Foregone (Choice B)"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Every choice involves a trade-off. When you choose to spend an hour studying, the opportunity cost is whatever else you could have done with that hour (working, sleeping, exercising). The 'cost' of a decision includes not just what you spend, but what you sacrifice by not choosing the alternative.",
      "key_insight": "Opportunity cost explains why 'there's no such thing as a free lunch.' Even when something appears free (like 'free' parking), there's an opportunity cost - that land could have been used for something else. In finance, the opportunity cost of investing in one asset is the return foregone from not investing in the next-best alternative, which is why we discount future cash flows at a rate reflecting this cost.",
      "technical_details": "In economics, opportunity cost is part of the true 'economic cost' which differs from accounting cost. Economic profit = Revenue - Economic Costs (including opportunity costs), while Accounting Profit = Revenue - Explicit Costs only. A firm earning zero economic profit is earning exactly its opportunity cost - what capital and labor could earn elsewhere.",
      "common_misconceptions": [
        "Opportunity cost is the sum of all alternatives - it's only the BEST alternative foregone, not all alternatives",
        "Opportunity cost only applies to money - it applies to time, resources, and any scarce factor",
        "Sunk costs create opportunity costs - sunk costs are already spent and don't affect future opportunity costs",
        "Opportunity cost is always explicit - it's often implicit and must be estimated"
