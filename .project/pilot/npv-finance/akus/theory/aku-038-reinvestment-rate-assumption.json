    "statement": {
      "text": "NPV implicitly assumes intermediate cash flows are reinvested at the discount rate (cost of capital), while IRR assumes reinvestment at the IRR itself - a key difference that can lead to different project rankings.",

    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "When a project generates cash in year 3, what happens to that money until the project ends? NPV says it earns the cost of capital; IRR says it earns the project's IRR. For high-IRR projects, IRR's assumption is often unrealistic.",
      "key_insight": "NPV's reinvestment rate assumption is generally more realistic because companies can typically earn their cost of capital on incremental cash flows, but cannot necessarily find additional projects earning the same IRR.",
      "technical_details": "This difference only matters when comparing projects with different lives or timing of cash flows. The Modified IRR (MIRR) addresses this by using a explicit reinvestment rate assumption, making it more comparable to NPV results.",
      "common_misconceptions": [
        "The reinvestment assumption is an optional feature - it's built into the mathematics of each method",
        "High IRR always means high value creation - only true if reinvestment rate equals IRR",
        "NPV has no reinvestment assumption - it does, just a more realistic one"
