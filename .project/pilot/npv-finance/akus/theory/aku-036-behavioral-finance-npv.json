      "formal": "Biased NPV = f(True NPV, Cognitive Biases, Organizational Factors)"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Even with perfect NPV models, humans make mistakes. We're overconfident in our forecasts, anchor on initial estimates, and let sunk costs influence decisions. Understanding these biases helps us design better decision processes.",
      "key_insight": "The biggest risk in NPV analysis is often not the calculations but the inputs - specifically, biased cash flow forecasts driven by overoptimism, anchoring, or organizational pressures.",
      "technical_details": "Research shows systematic patterns: forecasts are typically too optimistic, projects take longer and cost more than expected, and decision-makers escalate commitment to failing projects. De-biasing techniques include using reference class forecasting, outside views, and premortem analysis.",
      "common_misconceptions": [
        "Sophisticated models eliminate bias - garbage in, garbage out still applies",
        "Biases cancel out over many projects - some biases (optimism) are systematic, not random",
        "Awareness of biases prevents them - knowing about biases helps but doesn't eliminate them"
