    "statement": {
      "text": "Net Present Value (NPV) and Internal Rate of Return (IRR) are the two most widely used capital budgeting criteria. While both use discounted cash flows, they can give conflicting recommendations in certain situations. NPV is generally considered theoretically superior because it directly measures value creation, while IRR measures the rate of return. When NPV and IRR conflict, NPV should be preferred.",
      "formal": "NPV > 0 ⟺ IRR > r (for conventional cash flows), but may conflict for mutually exclusive projects or non-conventional cash flows"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "NPV tells you 'how much wealth does this project create?' while IRR tells you 'what percentage return does this project earn?' For a single accept/reject decision with conventional cash flows, both give the same answer. But when comparing projects of different sizes or durations, or with unusual cash flow patterns, they can disagree.",
      "key_insight": "NPV is theoretically superior for three main reasons: (1) it directly measures dollar value creation, which is the firm's ultimate goal, (2) it assumes reinvestment at the cost of capital (more realistic than IRR's implicit assumption), and (3) it handles non-conventional cash flows and mutually exclusive projects correctly. However, managers often prefer IRR because it's expressed as a familiar percentage return.",
      "technical_details": "Conflicts arise in three main scenarios: (1) Mutually exclusive projects of different scales - IRR favors smaller projects with higher percentages; (2) Mutually exclusive projects with different timing - IRR may favor projects with faster payback; (3) Non-conventional cash flows (multiple sign changes) - IRR can have multiple solutions or none. The 'crossover rate' is where two projects have equal NPV; above this rate, the rankings change.",
      "common_misconceptions": [
        "Higher IRR always means better project - not true when comparing mutually exclusive projects",
        "IRR is the actual return earned - only if cash flows can be reinvested at that rate",
        "NPV and IRR always agree - they agree for accept/reject but may conflict for ranking",
        "Multiple IRRs make a project bad - it just means IRR isn't the right criterion"
