    "statement": {
      "text": "Capital Rationing occurs when a firm has more positive NPV projects than it can fund due to budget constraints. In such situations, the firm must choose which projects to accept. The Profitability Index (PI) helps rank projects to maximize total value per dollar invested."
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "If you have $10 million to invest but $15 million of positive NPV projects, you can't do them all. You need to pick the combination that creates the most value. Simply picking the highest NPV projects isn't always optimal - you want the most 'bang for your buck.'",
      "key_insight": "Under capital rationing, maximize total NPV subject to the budget constraint. With single-period rationing and divisible projects, rank by PI and accept in order until budget is exhausted. With indivisible projects or multi-period constraints, integer programming may be needed.",
      "technical_details": "Soft rationing: Internal budget limits set by management - can be relaxed if justified. Hard rationing: Genuine inability to raise capital (market imperfections). The theoretical answer is to raise more capital for positive NPV projects, but real-world constraints often prevent this."
