    "statement": {
      "text": "While NPV is the theoretically preferred capital budgeting method, it has important limitations and assumptions that practitioners must understand. These include assumptions about certain cash flows, fixed discount rates, and the inability to capture managerial flexibility. Understanding these limitations leads to more sophisticated approaches like real options analysis."
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "NPV tells you the value assuming you make the investment and let it play out. But in reality, you can adjust course - expand if things go well, abandon if they don't. Standard NPV misses this 'option value' of managerial flexibility.",
      "key_insight": "NPV's key limitation is treating investment as a now-or-never, all-or-nothing decision with known outcomes. In reality: (1) many decisions can be deferred, (2) projects can be expanded, contracted, or abandoned mid-course, (3) cash flows are uncertain, and (4) discount rates change. These limitations lead to real options theory and Monte Carlo simulation.",
      "technical_details": "Specific assumptions and limitations: (1) Cash flow certainty - NPV uses expected values, ignoring variance, (2) Constant discount rate - assumes flat term structure and unchanging risk, (3) No managerial flexibility - ignores option to expand/contract/abandon, (4) Perfect capital markets - unlimited borrowing at WACC, (5) Reinvestment assumption - cash flows reinvested at discount rate, (6) Independent projects - doesn't capture portfolio effects or synergies."
