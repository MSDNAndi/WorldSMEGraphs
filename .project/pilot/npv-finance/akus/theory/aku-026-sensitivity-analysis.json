    "statement": {
      "text": "Sensitivity Analysis examines how changes in individual assumptions affect NPV. By varying one input at a time (sales volume, price, costs, discount rate), managers can identify which factors have the greatest impact on project value and where additional analysis or risk mitigation is needed."
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "NPV is only as good as its inputs. Sensitivity analysis asks 'what if I'm wrong?' By testing how NPV changes when assumptions change, you identify the critical uncertainties and assess downside risk.",
      "key_insight": "The goal isn't prediction accuracy but understanding which assumptions matter most. A project might be profitable under base assumptions but highly sensitive to raw material costs - this tells you where to focus risk management efforts.",
      "technical_details": "Method: (1) Identify key value drivers (volume, price, costs, timing), (2) Establish plausible range for each (optimistic, base, pessimistic), (3) Vary one factor at a time, recalculate NPV, (4) Display results in a tornado diagram (factors ordered by impact magnitude)."
