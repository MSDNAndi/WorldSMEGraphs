    "statement": {
      "text": "The Prime Number Theorem describes the asymptotic distribution of prime numbers among positive integers. It states that the number of primes less than or equal to x, denoted π(x), is approximately x/ln(x). More precisely, the ratio π(x)/(x/ln(x)) approaches 1 as x approaches infinity.",
      "formal": "lim(x→∞) [π(x) / (x/ln(x))] = 1, where π(x) = |{p ≤ x : p is prime}|. Equivalently, π(x) ~ x/ln(x) or π(x) ~ Li(x) = ∫₂ˣ dt/ln(t)"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "If you want to know approximately how many primes exist below a large number N, divide N by its natural logarithm. For example, below 1,000,000 there are about 1,000,000/ln(1,000,000) ≈ 72,382 primes (actual: 78,498). The approximation gets better as numbers grow larger—it's not exact, but remarkably accurate for large values.",
      "key_insight": "Primes become less frequent as numbers grow, but in a predictable way. Around the number N, roughly 1 in ln(N) numbers is prime. This 'prime density' decreases logarithmically, not linearly or exponentially. This theorem connects the seemingly random occurrence of primes to the smooth, continuous function ln(x).",
      "technical_details": "Proved independently by Hadamard and de la Vallée Poussin in 1896 using complex analysis and the Riemann zeta function. The logarithmic integral Li(x) provides a better approximation than x/ln(x). Error terms are studied via the Riemann Hypothesis—if RH is true, error is O(√x ln(x)). The theorem is fundamental to analytic number theory and has applications in cryptography, computational complexity, and probabilistic algorithms.",
      "common_misconceptions": [
        "The theorem gives exact counts—it's asymptotic, meaning the ratio approaches 1, not that values are equal",
        "Primes become 'rare'—they do thin out but infinitely many still exist",
        "The theorem predicts individual primes—it describes overall distribution, not specific locations",
        "x/ln(x) is the best approximation—Li(x) is more accurate"
