# Fermat Primes

## Overview
This domain covers Fermat primes - extremely rare prime numbers of the form 2^(2^n) + 1. Only 5 Fermat primes are known, and they have a remarkable connection to geometric constructions.

## Domain Path
`science/math/number-theory/fermat-primes`

## Key Concepts
- Definition: Fₙ = 2^(2^n) + 1
- Fermat's (incorrect) conjecture
- Extreme rarity (only 5 known)
- Gauss's construction theorem
- Connection to constructible polygons

## The 5 Known Fermat Primes
1. **F₀ = 3** (2^1 + 1)
2. **F₁ = 5** (2^2 + 1)
3. **F₂ = 17** (2^4 + 1)
4. **F₃ = 257** (2^8 + 1)
5. **F₄ = 65537** (2^16 + 1)

All higher Fermat numbers tested are composite.

## Gauss's Construction Theorem
**Revolutionary Discovery**: A regular n-sided polygon can be constructed with compass and straightedge if and only if:
```
n = 2^k × p₁ × p₂ × ... × pₘ
```
where p₁, p₂, ..., pₘ are distinct Fermat primes.

This solved a 2000-year-old problem in geometry!

## Constructible Polygons
- **Yes**: 3, 5, 15, 17, 51, 257, 65537-gons
- **No**: 7, 9, 11, 13-gons (not Fermat primes or proper products)

## Historical Significance
- **1640**: Fermat conjectures all numbers of form 2^(2^n) + 1 are prime
- **1732**: Euler disproves conjecture by factoring F₅ = 641 × 6700417
- **1796**: 19-year-old Gauss proves 17-gon is constructible, inspiring his mathematical career

## Relationships
- **Analogous to**: Mersenne Primes (different special form)
- **Enables**: Geometric constructions with compass and straightedge
- **Applications**: RSA cryptography (F₄ = 65537 commonly used)
