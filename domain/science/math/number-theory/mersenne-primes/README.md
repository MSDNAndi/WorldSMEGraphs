# Mersenne Primes

## Overview
This domain covers Mersenne primes - prime numbers of the form 2^p - 1 where p is also prime. These are among the largest known primes and are fundamentally connected to perfect numbers.

## Domain Path
`science/math/number-theory/mersenne-primes`

## Key Concepts
- Definition: Mₚ = 2^p - 1 (where p is prime and Mₚ is prime)
- Lucas-Lehmer primality test
- Connection to perfect numbers (Euclid-Euler theorem)
- GIMPS (Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search)
- Computational number theory

## Current AKUs
1. **aku-001-mersenne-primes-definition** - Core definition, properties, and computational aspects

## Known Mersenne Primes
- As of 2024: 51 known Mersenne primes
- First few: M₂=3, M₃=7, M₅=31, M₇=127, M₁₃=8191
- Largest: 2^82589933 - 1 (24,862,048 digits, discovered 2018)
- The largest known prime is always a Mersenne prime

## Important Note
Not all Mersenne numbers are prime! 
- If p is prime, 2^p - 1 **may** be prime
- Example: M₁₁ = 2047 = 23 × 89 (composite)

## Relationships
- **Fundamental connection**: Perfect Numbers (every even perfect number arises from a Mersenne prime)
- **Related to**: Prime number theory, computational mathematics
- **Efficient testing**: Lucas-Lehmer test
- **Modern discovery**: GIMPS distributed computing project

## Open Problems
- Are there infinitely many Mersenne primes?
- Are there infinitely many composite Mersenne numbers with prime exponent?

## Computational Aspects
- Lucas-Lehmer test: O(p²) complexity
- GIMPS: Volunteer distributed computing since 1996
- Binary representation: All 1's (repunits in base 2)

## Learning Path
This concept connects to:
- Prime number theory
- Perfect numbers
- Computational complexity
- Distributed computing
- History of mathematics

## Target Audiences
- High school students (advanced)
- Undergraduate mathematics students
- Computer science students
- Math and computing enthusiasts

## Historical Context
Named after Marin Mersenne (1588-1648), a French monk who studied these numbers. The Lucas-Lehmer test was developed by Édouard Lucas (1878) and refined by Derrick Henry Lehmer (1930).
