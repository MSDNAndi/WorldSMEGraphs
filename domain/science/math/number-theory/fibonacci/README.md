# Fibonacci Sequence

## Overview
This domain covers the Fibonacci sequence - one of the most famous sequences in mathematics where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones. The sequence appears throughout nature, art, and science.

## Domain Path
`science/math/number-theory/fibonacci`

## Key Concepts
- Recursive definition: F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)
- Golden ratio connection
- Binet's formula (closed-form expression)
- Fibonacci primes
- Applications in nature and computer science

## Current AKUs
1. **aku-001-fibonacci-sequence-definition** - Core definition, properties, and connections

## The Sequence
0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233, 377, 610, 987, ...

## Relationships
- **Converges to**: Golden Ratio (φ ≈ 1.618)
- **Related sequences**: Lucas numbers
- **Intersects with**: Prime numbers (Fibonacci primes)
- **Applications**: Nature (phyllotaxis), computer science (recursion), algorithm analysis

## Notable Properties
- Ratio of consecutive terms approaches golden ratio
- Appears in spiral patterns in nature
- Used in algorithm analysis
- Connection to matrix exponentials
- Divisibility properties with GCD

## Learning Path
This concept connects to:
- Recursive sequences
- Golden ratio and geometric proportions
