    "statement": {
      "text": "The golden ratio and golden angle (≈137.5°) appear in various natural structures, most notably in phyllotaxis (the arrangement of leaves, seeds, and petals in plants). The golden angle optimizes packing efficiency and sunlight exposure, though claims of the golden ratio's ubiquity in nature are often exaggerated.",
      "formal": "Golden angle = 360°(1 - 1/φ) = 360°/φ² ≈ 137.508°, appearing as the divergence angle in plant phyllotaxis"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Imagine a sunflower trying to pack its seeds as efficiently as possible. If seeds appeared at regular intervals (say, every 90°), they'd form straight lines with gaps. But at the golden angle (about 137.5°), each new seed fills the space optimally, creating the beautiful spiral patterns we observe. Nature 'discovered' this through evolution because it maximizes packing and resource distribution.",
      "key_insight": "The golden angle is optimal for phyllotaxis because φ is the 'most irrational' number—hardest to express as a simple fraction. This means the spiral pattern avoids resonance (repetitive alignment) that would create gaps or overlaps. The golden ratio appears not because nature is 'mystical' but because it solves specific optimization problems through evolutionary selection.",
      "technical_details": "In phyllotaxis, the golden angle θ = 2π(1 - 1/φ) ≈ 2.399 radians minimizes gaps between plant organs. Consecutive Fibonacci numbers (leaves, petals, spirals) appear because they provide the best rational approximations to the golden ratio at each stage of growth. Mathematical models (Hofmeister's rule, Douady-Couder's equations) show that growth dynamics naturally converge to the golden angle for optimal packing. However, actual measurements often show approximations rather than exact values.",
