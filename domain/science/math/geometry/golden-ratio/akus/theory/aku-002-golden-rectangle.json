    "statement": {
      "text": "A golden rectangle is a rectangle whose side lengths are in the golden ratio φ ≈ 1.618. If the width is 1 unit, the height is φ units (or vice versa). The golden rectangle has the unique property that when a square is removed from it, the remaining rectangle is also a golden rectangle.",
      "formal": "Let rectangle ABCD have width w and height h. It is a golden rectangle iff h/w = φ = (1+√5)/2"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Imagine a rectangle that looks 'perfectly balanced'—not too square, not too elongated. The golden rectangle achieves this at the ratio 1:1.618. Its most remarkable feature: if you cut off the largest possible square, what remains is another, smaller golden rectangle. You can repeat this forever, creating an infinite sequence of nested golden rectangles and squares.",
      "key_insight": "The golden rectangle is self-similar: removing a square leaves another golden rectangle. This property generates the golden spiral when you connect the corners of successive squares with quarter-circle arcs. This self-similarity makes it mathematically elegant and appears in optimal packing and growth patterns in nature.",
      "technical_details": "For a golden rectangle with width w, height h = φw. Removing a square of side w leaves a rectangle with dimensions (φw - w) × w = w(φ - 1) × w. Since 1/φ = φ - 1, this new rectangle has dimensions w × w/(φ) = w × w(φ-1) = w(φ-1) × w. The ratio is w/(w(φ-1)) = 1/(φ-1) = φ, proving it's also a golden rectangle. This process can continue infinitely, generating the golden spiral.",

        "The Parthenon is a golden rectangle—DEBATED: Measurements vary, evidence is weak",
