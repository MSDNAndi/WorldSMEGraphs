    This domain contains functional programming APPLICATION of mathematical concepts.
    Per the global hierarchy (domain/_ontology/global-hierarchy.yaml), mathematical 
    concepts like category theory, functors, monoids, and monads have their NATIVE 
    home in formal-sciences/mathematics/pure-mathematics/. This domain provides 
    programming-specific context, code examples, and practical applications that 
    LINK to the mathematical definitions. See Issue #3 for migration plan.
