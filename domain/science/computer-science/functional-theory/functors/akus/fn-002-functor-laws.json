    "statement": "Functors must satisfy two laws: (1) Identity preservation: F(id_A) = id_F(A), and (2) Composition preservation: F(g∘f) = F(g)∘F(f).",
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Functor laws ensure that the 'translation' between categories is faithful. Identity preservation means 'doing nothing' stays 'doing nothing'. Composition preservation means combining operations before translation equals translating then combining.",
      "key_insight": "These laws guarantee that functors preserve the categorical structure completely. Without them, we'd just have arbitrary mappings, not structure-preserving transformations.",
      "technical_details": "Given F: C→D, identity law requires F(id_A) = id_F(A) for every object A. Composition law requires F(g∘f) = F(g)∘F(f) for all composable morphisms f: A→B and g: B→C. These ensure F respects the category structure."
