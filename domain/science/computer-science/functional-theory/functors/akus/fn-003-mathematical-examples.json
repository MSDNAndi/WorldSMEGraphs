    "statement": "Functors appear throughout mathematics: power set P: Set→Set, free group F: Set→Grp, forgetful functors U: Grp→Set, fundamental group π₁: Top→Grp, and homology functors H_n: Top→Vect.",
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Mathematical functors capture systematic ways of building new structures from old ones. The power set functor builds 'sets of subsets', the free group functor builds 'the freest group possible' from a set, forgetful functors 'forget' structure.",
      "key_insight": "Functors formalize common mathematical constructions. Many natural operations (taking subsets, building free objects, forgetting structure) are actually functors - structure-preserving transformations between categories.",
      "technical_details": "Each example maps objects and morphisms while preserving composition and identity. Power set maps sets to their power sets and functions to their inverse images. Free functors build free algebraic structures. Forgetful functors strip away structure."
