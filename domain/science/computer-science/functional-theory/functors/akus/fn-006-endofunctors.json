    "statement": "An endofunctor is a functor from a category to itself (F: C→C), mapping objects and morphisms within the same category. All monads are endofunctors.",
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "An endofunctor is a 'self-transformation' of a category - it maps objects and morphisms back into the same category. Think of reshaping data while staying in the same universe of types. Most functors in programming are endofunctors.",
      "key_insight": "Endofunctors are crucial for monads because monads require composition of a functor with itself (F∘F), which only makes sense for endofunctors. This is why 'a monad is a monoid in the category of endofunctors'.",
      "technical_details": "An endofunctor F: C→C maps C to itself. For types, List: Types→Types is an endofunctor (maps Int to List<Int>, etc.). Endofunctors can be composed (F∘G is an endofunctor if F and G are), enabling monad structure."
