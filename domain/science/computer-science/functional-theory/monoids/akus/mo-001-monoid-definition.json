    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "A monoid is anything you can 'combine' (with an operation that's associative) and that has a 'neutral element' that does nothing when combined. Think of adding numbers (0 is neutral), concatenating strings (empty string is neutral), or composing functions (identity is neutral).",

      "technical_details": "Formally, a monoid (M, ·, e) consists of: (1) A set M, (2) A binary operation ·: M × M → M, (3) An identity element e ∈ M, satisfying: Associativity: (a·b)·c = a·(b·c) for all a,b,c ∈ M, and Identity: e·a = a·e = a for all a ∈ M."
