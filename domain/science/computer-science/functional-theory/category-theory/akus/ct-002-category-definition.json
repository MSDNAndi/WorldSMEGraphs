      "intuition": "A category is a mathematical universe where objects exist and arrows connect them. What matters isn't what the objects are, but how the arrows compose - just as in navigation, the connections between places matter more than the places themselves.",
      "key_insight": "Categories shift focus from objects to relationships. The essence of mathematical structure lies not in the objects themselves but in how they relate through morphisms.",
      "technical_details": "Formally, a category C comprises: (1) A collection ob(C) of objects, (2) For each pair of objects A,B a collection hom(A,B) of morphisms from A to B, (3) For morphisms f: A→B and g: B→C, a composition g∘f: A→C, (4) For each object A, an identity morphism idₐ: A→A."
