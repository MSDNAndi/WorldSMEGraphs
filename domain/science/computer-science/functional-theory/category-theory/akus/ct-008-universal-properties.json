    "statement": "Universal properties define mathematical objects by how they relate to all other objects in a category, rather than by their internal structure - capturing the essence of 'optimal' or 'universal' solutions.",
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Instead of saying 'a product A×B is a set of pairs', we say 'A×B is the unique object that makes all relevant diagrams commute'. This 'definition by relationship' is more abstract but transfers across all categories.",
      "key_insight": "Universal properties shift from concrete construction to abstract characterization. They define objects up to unique isomorphism by their behavior with respect to morphisms, making definitions portable across categories.",
      "technical_details": "A universal property specifies an object X by the existence of morphisms and a uniqueness condition: for any object Y with certain properties, there exists a unique morphism Y→X (or X→Y) making relevant diagrams commute. Examples: products, coproducts, limits, colimits."

        "intuition": "The product is the 'most efficient' way to capture both A and B simultaneously"
