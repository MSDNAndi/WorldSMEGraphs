      "intuition": "The identity morphism is like staying in place - a road from a city to itself. When you compose a journey with 'staying put', you get the original journey unchanged. It's the 'do nothing' operation that every object possesses.",
      "key_insight": "Identity morphisms provide the neutral element for composition, making categories into a structured algebraic system. They ensure every object has a canonical 'self-reference' that preserves structure.",
      "technical_details": "For each object A in category C, there exists a unique morphism id_A ∈ hom(A,A) such that for any f: A→B and g: C→A, we have f∘id_A = f and id_A∘g = g. This uniqueness is provable from the identity laws."
