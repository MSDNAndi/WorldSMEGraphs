    "statement": "Morphisms (also called arrows or maps) are the structure-preserving relationships between objects in a category, representing the fundamental way objects relate to each other.",
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "If objects are cities, morphisms are the roads connecting them. What makes a category useful isn't the cities themselves, but the network of roads and how they connect. Morphisms capture 'ways to go from A to B' while preserving relevant structure.",
      "key_insight": "Morphisms are more fundamental than objects in category theory. The slogan is 'objects are defined by their relationships' - an object is completely characterized by all morphisms to and from it.",
      "technical_details": "A morphism f from object A to object B, written f: A→B, is an abstract arrow. The collection of all morphisms from A to B is denoted hom(A,B) or C(A,B). Morphisms must be composable and possess identities, but their internal nature is intentionally abstract."
