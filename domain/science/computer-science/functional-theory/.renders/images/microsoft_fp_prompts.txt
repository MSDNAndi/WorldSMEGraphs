# Title Slide - Microsoft Azure tech theme
Abstract technology background with flowing digital neural network elements, Microsoft Azure blue color palette with subtle purple and teal accents, modern corporate professional style, clean geometric patterns subtly integrated, no text or logos, high quality digital art suitable for developer conference title slide, elegant and sophisticated tech aesthetic

# Category Theory - Arrows and Composition
Technical illustration showing abstract concept of mathematical composition, geometric shapes connected by flowing curved arrows in a network pattern, objects transforming through morphisms represented as glowing pathways, blue and purple gradient background, clean minimalist design with subtle glow effects, no text labels, professional presentation quality, suitable for explaining category theory visually

# Functors - Transformation and Mapping  
Visual metaphor for transformation and structure-preserving mapping, two parallel geometric structures with one transforming into another while maintaining relationships, ethereal light beams connecting corresponding elements, teal and blue color scheme, abstract but meaningful visualization, clean modern technical illustration style, no text, suitable for functional programming education

# Monoids - Aggregation and Combination
Abstract visualization of elements combining and aggregating together, multiple geometric shapes flowing into unified larger structures, sense of composition and identity, golden and blue color harmony, clean corporate technical style, parallel streams merging, representing algebraic combination, no text, professional presentation quality

# Monads - Sequential Composition and Chaining
Flowing abstract visualization of sequential computational steps, nested containers unwrapping and rewrapping in elegant chains, sense of controlled complexity and graceful composition, purple and blue gradients with subtle geometric patterns, modern digital aesthetic representing bind and return operations, clean professional style, no text elements

# Grand Unification - Everything Connects
Convergent abstract design showing diverse mathematical concepts unifying into coherent whole, multiple streams of different colors (blue, purple, teal, gold) flowing together in harmony, representing the famous quote about monads being monoids in category of endofunctors, professional tech aesthetic, clean modern composition, no text, suitable for conclusion slide

# F# and C# Integration Theme
Abstract visualization representing the harmony between object-oriented and functional paradigms, interweaving geometric and organic patterns, Microsoft-inspired blue and purple palette, sense of two approaches complementing each other, clean professional corporate style, modern digital aesthetic, no text, suitable for .NET ecosystem presentation

# LINQ and Query Expression Theme
Flowing data pipeline visualization, abstract representation of data transforming through query stages, clean geometric elements suggesting select, where, and aggregate operations, blue and teal colors, professional technical illustration, sense of elegant data processing, no text elements, suitable for developer education
