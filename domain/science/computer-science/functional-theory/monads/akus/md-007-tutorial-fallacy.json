    "statement": "The 'monad tutorial fallacy' is the phenomenon where understanding monads leads one to write a monad tutorial using a particular analogy, which ironically doesn't help others understand monads because understanding is experiential, not analogical.",
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "When you finally 'get' monads, the insight feels so clear that you want to share it via an analogy (burritos, space suits, etc.). But that analogy only works for you because you already understand monads. Others need to build understanding through practice, not metaphors.",
      "key_insight": "Monads can't be explained via analogy because they're an abstract pattern. The 'aha moment' comes from recognizing the pattern across multiple concrete examples (Maybe, List, IO), not from a single perfect metaphor.",
      "technical_details": "The fallacy is documented by Brent Yorgey. It's a meta-observation about pedagogy: analogies are personal and don't transfer. What helps is working with multiple monads, seeing the commonalities, and building intuition through practice."
