    "title": "Why Planck Units Matter",
    "summary": "Planck units are not just a convenient system of measurement—they mark the scales where our current understanding of physics breaks down and quantum gravity becomes essential. They define the ultimate limits of measurability in the universe.",
    "key_reasons": [
      {
        "reason": "Unique Natural Scales",
        "explanation": "Planck units are the only scales constructible from c, ℏ, and G without arbitrary choices. They don't depend on any particular particle or material.",
        "significance": "Nature provides these scales; we merely discover them"
      },
      {
        "reason": "Quantum Gravity Threshold",
        "explanation": "At Planck scales, both quantum effects (ℏ) and gravitational effects (G) become equally important. Our separate theories of QM and GR must merge.",
        "significance": "Defines where we need new physics"
      },
      {
        "reason": "Limits of Measurability",
        "explanation": "Cannot measure distances < ℓ_P, times < t_P, or temperatures > T_P. Attempting to do so creates black holes or other quantum gravitational objects.",
        "significance": "Fundamental limits on knowledge, not just technology"
      },
      {
        "reason": "Cosmological Relevance",
        "explanation": "The early universe at t < t_P was in the Planck epoch where quantum gravity dominated. Understanding the Big Bang requires understanding Planck physics.",

      },
      {
        "reason": "Benchmark for Particle Physics",
