      "text": "Planck units represent natural scales where quantum mechanics and gravity become equally important, but they are NOT universally the smallest possible values for each quantity. The Planck length and Planck time likely represent true minimum measurable values, but Planck mass and Planck energy are actually LARGE values. Some 'smallest' values are exactly defined (like ℏ for angular momentum), while others (like minimum length) remain theoretical predictions.",

Some Planck units are minimum scales, others are characteristic scales where new physics emerges, and some are exact quanta with no derivation needed.",
      "technical_details": "Planck units derive from dimensional analysis combining ℏ, G, c, k_B. Whether they represent true minima depends on the quantity's physics: (1) Length/time: generalized uncertainty principle suggests ℓₚ, tₚ are minimum measurable values; (2) Angular momentum/action: ℏ is the exact quantum - all values are integer or half-integer multiples; (3) Mass/energy: Planck values are characteristic scales, not minima - elementary particles are ~10¹⁹× smaller in mass.",
