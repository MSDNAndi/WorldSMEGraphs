# Notes
notes: |
  Planck units domain is at Level 2 (Emerging). The content is well-balanced
  for its current maturity level, with excellent distribution of definitions,
  formulas, and examples. However, the domain is completely isolated with zero
  cross-links, which severely limits its utility for interconnected reasoning.
  
  Priority should be given to:
  1. Splitting over-bundled AKUs for better granularity
  2. Adding missing Planck units to complete the unit system
  3. Creating theory AKUs to enable Level 3 advancement
  4. Establishing cross-links to related physics domains
  
  The domain is sufficient for graduate student coursework on Planck units as
  an isolated topic, but NOT sufficient for quantum gravity research or
  interconnected multi-domain questions.
