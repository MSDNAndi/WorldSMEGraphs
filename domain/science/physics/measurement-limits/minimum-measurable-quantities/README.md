# Minimum Measurable Quantities

This domain covers the **smallest measurable or detectable values** for various physical quantities. Unlike Planck units (which are theoretical scales that can be very large, like Planck mass ≈ 22 μg), these AKUs document the practical and theoretical limits on how small a measurement can be.

## Key Distinction from Planck Units

| Quantity | Planck Value | Smallest Measurable | Ratio |
|----------|-------------|---------------------|-------|
| Mass | 2.18 × 10⁻⁸ kg (large!) | ~10⁻³⁰ kg (neutrino) | 10²² |
| Energy | 1.96 × 10⁹ J (large!) | ~10⁻³¹ J (single photon) | 10⁴⁰ |
| Length | 1.62 × 10⁻³⁵ m | ~10⁻¹⁸ m (proton radius precision) | 10¹⁷ |
| Time | 5.39 × 10⁻⁴⁴ s | ~10⁻²¹ s (attosecond) | 10²³ |

## Categories of Limits
