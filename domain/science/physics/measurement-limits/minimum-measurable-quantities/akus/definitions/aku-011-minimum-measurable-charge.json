    "statement": {
      "text": "The elementary charge e = 1.602176634 × 10⁻¹⁹ C is the smallest FREE electric charge in nature—all observable charges are integer multiples of e. Quarks carry fractional charges (±1/3e, ±2/3e) but are confined and never observed free. Single-electron transistors (SETs) detect charge changes of ~10⁻⁶ e. The Planck charge (qₚ = √(4πε₀ℏc) ≈ 1.88 × 10⁻¹⁸ C ≈ 11.7e) is NOT minimum—it's ~12 times larger than e.",
      "formal": "Elementary charge: e = 1.602176634 × 10⁻¹⁹ C (exact by SI definition); Quark charges: ±e/3, ±2e/3; SET sensitivity: ~10⁻⁶ e",

    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Electric charge is quantized—it comes only in integer multiples of e for free particles. This was demonstrated by Millikan's oil drop experiment. Quarks have fractional charges (1/3 or 2/3 of e) but are permanently confined within hadrons by the strong force. The Planck charge is NOT a minimum—it's about 12 times LARGER than the electron charge.",
      "key_insight": "Charge quantization is one of the deepest mysteries in physics—why does e have the value it does? Grand unified theories predict charge quantization from magnetic monopoles. SETs can resolve charge to ~10⁻⁶ e, but this is measuring partial redistribution of continuous charge in a capacitor, not fractional elementary charges.",
      "technical_details": "The elementary charge became exact in 2019 SI: e = 1.602176634 × 10⁻¹⁹ C. This defines the ampere as e/(1 s) × (frequency). Single-electron transistors use Coulomb blockade to detect single-electron tunneling. Searches for free fractional charges (±e/3) have found none, confirming quark confinement."
