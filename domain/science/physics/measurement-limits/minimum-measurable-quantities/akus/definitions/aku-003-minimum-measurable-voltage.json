    "statement": {
      "text": "The smallest measurable voltage is limited by Johnson-Nyquist thermal noise: V_noise = √(4k_B T R Δf), where T is temperature, R is resistance, and Δf is bandwidth. At room temperature with 1 kΩ resistance and 1 Hz bandwidth, this gives ~4 nV. The quantum of voltage is the Josephson voltage V_J = h/2e ≈ 2.07 μV (for 1 GHz frequency). Modern nanovoltmeters achieve ~1 nV resolution, while SQUIDs can detect flux changes corresponding to ~10⁻¹⁵ V. There is NO fundamental minimum voltage—quantum mechanics sets noise floors, not hard limits.",
      "formal": "Johnson noise: V_n = √(4k_B T R Δf); Josephson: V_J = hf/2e; Quantum limit: ~ℏ/(e·τ) for measurement time τ",

    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Voltage measurements are limited by thermal fluctuations of electrons in conductors (Johnson noise). Cooling the detector reduces noise, and SQUID magnetometers cooled to mK can detect extraordinarily small signals. The Planck voltage (~10²⁷ V) is NOT a minimum—it's the voltage where electromagnetic and gravitational effects become comparable at Planck scale.",
      "key_insight": "The fundamental limit is √(4k_B T R Δf) for thermal noise. This can be reduced by: (1) Cooling (T↓), (2) Reducing bandwidth (Δf↓), (3) Impedance matching. Quantum limits arise from uncertainty: ΔV·Δt ~ ℏ/e for voltage fluctuations. Josephson junctions provide quantum-accurate voltage standards because V = (h/2e)f is exact.",
      "technical_details": "Johnson-Nyquist noise power is 4k_B T per Hz, independent of resistance (noise voltage scales with √R). At 4K with 1Ω and 1Hz bandwidth, noise is ~0.4 nV. At 10 mK, it's ~4 pV. SQUIDs achieve ~1 μΦ₀/√Hz sensitivity, corresponding to ~pV signals through inductive coupling. Modern commercial nanovoltmeters (e.g., Keithley 2182A) resolve ~1 nV with averaging."
