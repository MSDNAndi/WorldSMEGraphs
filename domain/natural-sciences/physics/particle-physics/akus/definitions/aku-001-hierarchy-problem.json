    "statement": {
      "text": "The hierarchy problem is the puzzle of why the electroweak scale (~246 GeV) is so much smaller than the Planck scale (~10^19 GeV) - a ratio of about 10^17. This enormous gap between the two fundamental scales in physics appears unnatural because quantum corrections should push the Higgs mass toward the Planck scale.",

    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Imagine you're trying to balance a pencil on its tip - quantum mechanics would constantly try to tip it over. The hierarchy problem is similar: quantum effects try to push the Higgs mass toward the Planck scale, yet it remains tiny. This requires incredibly precise cancellations, which seems unnatural without some underlying reason.",
      "key_insight": "The problem isn't that the Standard Model is inconsistent, but that it appears 'fine-tuned' - the bare Higgs mass and quantum corrections must cancel to 1 part in 10^34 to give the observed mass. This suggests missing physics between these scales.",
      "technical_details": "In the Standard Model, the Higgs mass receives quantum corrections: δm_H² ~ Λ² where Λ is the cutoff scale. If Λ = M_Planck, then δm_H² ~ 10^38 GeV², yet the observed m_H² ~ 10^4 GeV². This requires cancellation to 34 decimal places."
