      "text": "The electroweak scale is the characteristic energy scale of electroweak symmetry breaking, approximately 246 GeV. This is set by the vacuum expectation value (VEV) of the Higgs field and determines the masses of the W and Z bosons that mediate the weak force.",
      "formal": "v = (√2 G_F)^(-1/2) ≈ 246 GeV",

    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "The electroweak scale is like the 'temperature' at which the electromagnetic and weak forces separate. Above this energy, they appear as one unified electroweak force; below it, they seem like distinct forces with different strengths and ranges.",
      "key_insight": "This scale is enormously smaller than the Planck scale (by a factor of 10^17), which is the essence of the hierarchy problem. All known particle physics operates at or below this scale.",
      "technical_details": "The Fermi constant G_F ≈ 1.166 × 10^-5 GeV^-2 sets the weak interaction strength. The electroweak VEV v is related to W and Z masses: m_W = gv/2, m_Z = √(g² + g'²)v/2, where g and g' are gauge couplings."
