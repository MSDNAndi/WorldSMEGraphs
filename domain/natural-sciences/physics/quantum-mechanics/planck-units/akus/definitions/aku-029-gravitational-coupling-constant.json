    "statement": {
      "text": "The gravitational coupling constant α_G = Gm²/(ℏc) is a dimensionless measure of the strength of gravity relative to quantum effects for a particle of mass m. For electrons, α_G ≈ 1.75 × 10⁻⁴⁵, making gravity ~10⁴⁰ times weaker than electromagnetism at the atomic scale. This tiny value is central to the hierarchy problem: why is gravity so extraordinarily weak?",
      "formal": "α_G = Gm_e²/(ℏc) = (m_e/m_P)² ≈ 1.75 × 10⁻⁴⁵",

    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "The gravitational coupling constant measures how strongly a particle feels gravity compared to quantum effects. For an electron, α_G ≈ 10⁻⁴⁵ means gravity is inconceivably weak at atomic scales. Compare to the fine structure constant α ≈ 1/137 for electromagnetism: the ratio α/α_G ~ 10⁴³ tells us electromagnetism is 10⁴³ times stronger than gravity for electrons! This is why gravity is irrelevant for atomic and molecular physics.",
      "key_insight": "The gravitational coupling constant reveals the hierarchy problem: α_G is tiny because m_e << m_P. Why are fundamental particle masses (meV to hundreds of GeV) so much smaller than the Planck mass (10¹⁹ GeV)? This 10¹⁵-10²² ratio between electroweak scale and Planck scale is unexplained and one of the deepest mysteries in physics. Proposed solutions include supersymmetry, extra dimensions, and anthropic selection.",
      "technical_details": "α_G = Gm²/(ℏc) has the same structure as α = e²/(4πε₀ℏc): both are dimensionless ratios of (interaction strength) to quantum effects. For electrons: α_G = Gm_e²/(ℏc) = (m_e/m_P)² ≈ 1.75 × 10⁻⁴⁵. For protons: α_G(p) = Gm_p²/(ℏc) ≈ 5.9 × 10⁻³⁹. The gravitational force between two electrons is F_G/F_EM = α_G/α ≈ 10⁻⁴³. This ratio is independent of distance since both forces scale as 1/r². The weakness of gravity is why it takes ~10⁵⁷ atoms to make a 1-kg mass that has gravitational effects comparable to EM effects of a single electron.",
      "common_misconceptions": [
        "Gravity is 'fundamentally' weaker than EM - MISLEADING: G is just measured in different units; α_G depends on particle mass",
