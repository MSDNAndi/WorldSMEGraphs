    "title": "Inflation and the Planck Scale: Quantum Origins of Cosmic Structure",
    "abstract": "Cosmic inflation connects Planck-scale quantum fluctuations to the largest structures in the universe. During inflation, quantum fluctuations at nearly Planck-scale energies were stretched to macroscopic size, seeding the cosmic microwave background and galaxy formation—making the CMB our best window into physics near the Planck scale.",
    "statement": {
      "text": "Cosmic inflation stretches quantum fluctuations from sub-Planckian scales to cosmological scales. The energy scale during inflation H_inf ~ 10¹³-10¹⁴ GeV is only 10⁵-10⁶ below the Planck scale E_P ~ 10¹⁹ GeV. The observed CMB anisotropies (δT/T ~ 10⁻⁵) directly trace back to quantum fluctuations during inflation, providing our closest observational probe of Planck-scale physics.",

      "observable": "CMB temperature fluctuations δT/T ~ 10⁻⁵ encode inflationary quantum fluctuations"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Imagine the early universe: a hot, dense soup rapidly expanding. During a brief period called inflation (lasting ~10⁻³⁶ seconds), space expanded by a factor of at least 10²⁶. Quantum fluctuations—the irreducible jitter of quantum mechanics—got stretched like the pattern on a balloon being inflated. These tiny fluctuations (~10⁻³⁵ m initially) became the seeds for all cosmic structure: galaxies, stars, and us. The CMB's temperature variations are the fossilized imprint of these stretched quantum fluctuations.",
      "key_insight": "Inflation is the only known mechanism that connects quantum mechanics directly to cosmological observables. The scalar power spectrum P_s ∝ (H_inf/m_P)² means the amplitude of fluctuations depends on the ratio of inflationary Hubble parameter to Planck mass. This ratio is observable! We measure δT/T ~ 10⁻⁵, implying H_inf/m_P ~ 10⁻⁵, so inflation occurred at energy scale ~10¹³-10¹⁴ GeV—only 5-6 orders of magnitude below Planck scale.",
      "technical_details": "Inflationary quantum fluctuations: Mode equation ü_k + (k² - ä/a)u_k = 0 in conformal time. Bunch-Davies vacuum gives u_k = (1/√2k)e^(-ikτ)(1 - i/kτ). Power spectrum: P_ζ(k) = (H_inf²/8π²m_P²ε)|_{k=aH} where ε = -Ḣ/H² is slow-roll parameter. COBE normalization: A_s = P_ζ(k₀) = 2.1 × 10⁻⁹ at k₀ = 0.05 Mpc⁻¹. This gives H_inf ~ 10¹³ GeV for ε ~ 0.01. Tensor-to-scalar ratio r = 16ε probes H_inf directly: r = (P_t/P_s) = 16ε gives H_inf² = (π²/2) × r × A_s × m_P². Current bound r < 0.036 (BICEP/Keck 2021) implies H_inf < 6 × 10¹³ GeV. Trans-Planckian problem: Modes observed today had wavelength λ < ℓ_P at start of inflation! This challenges our use of standard QFT, potentially probing Planck physics.",
