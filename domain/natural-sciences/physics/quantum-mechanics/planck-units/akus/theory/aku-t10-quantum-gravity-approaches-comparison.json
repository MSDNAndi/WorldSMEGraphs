      "text": "Multiple approaches attempt to describe physics at the Planck scale, each with distinct predictions about spacetime structure. The four main approaches are: String Theory (vibrating strings, extra dimensions), Loop Quantum Gravity (discrete spin networks), Causal Dynamical Triangulations (simplicial path integral), and Causal Set Theory (discrete events). All agree on minimum length ~ℓ_P but differ in details of spacetime microstructure.",

    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Just as there are multiple consistent approaches to quantum field theory (canonical, path integral, etc.), there are multiple approaches to quantum gravity. Each makes slightly different predictions about what happens at the Planck scale, though all agree that classical smooth spacetime breaks down there. Comparing these approaches helps identify which predictions are robust (shared by all) vs. model-dependent.",
      "key_insight": "The remarkable fact is that EVERY serious quantum gravity approach predicts modifications at the Planck scale - minimum length, discrete structure, or modified uncertainty relations. This convergence from completely different starting points suggests these features are robust predictions of quantum gravity, not artifacts of particular approaches."
