    "title": "String Theory at the Planck Scale: Strings, Minimum Length, and Extra Dimensions",
    "abstract": "String theory replaces point particles with one-dimensional extended objects (strings) of characteristic length ℓ_s ~ ℓ_P. This leads to a natural UV cutoff, a minimum length ~ ℓ_s, and dramatically different physics at the Planck scale including extra dimensions, T-duality, and a landscape of possible vacua.",
    "statement": {
      "text": "In string theory, the fundamental objects are not point particles but one-dimensional strings of length ℓ_s = √(α') ~ ℓ_P. This extended nature provides a natural ultraviolet cutoff, eliminates point-particle divergences, and leads to a minimum measurable length ~ ℓ_s. T-duality (R ↔ α'/R) makes physics at scales smaller than ℓ_s equivalent to physics at scales larger than ℓ_s, effectively removing sub-Planckian physics.",
      "string_length": "ℓ_s = √(α') = √(2πℏ/T) where T is string tension",
      "relation_to_planck": "ℓ_s = g_s^(1/4)·ℓ_P (in Type II strings) where g_s is string coupling",
      "t_duality": "Physics at radius R is equivalent to physics at radius α'/R",
      "minimum_length": "Δx ≥ ℓ_s—strings cannot probe distances smaller than their own length"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Imagine replacing every point particle with a tiny vibrating string, like a guitar string but 10⁻³⁵ meters long. Different vibration modes correspond to different particles—one mode gives an electron, another a photon, another a graviton. Because strings are extended objects, they can't probe distances smaller than their own length ℓ_s. It's like trying to see details smaller than your measuring stick. This 'blurring' eliminates the infinities that plague point-particle physics and provides a natural minimum length.",
      "key_insight": "The most remarkable feature is T-duality: if you wrap a string around a circle of radius R, the physics is identical to wrapping it around a circle of radius ℓ_s²/R. This means R < ℓ_s is equivalent to R' > ℓ_s—there's no new physics below the string scale! Sub-Planckian distances don't really exist in string theory; they're 'dual' to super-Planckian distances. This is a profound realization: the very notion of 'smaller than ℓ_s' loses meaning.",
      "technical_details": "String length: ℓ_s = √(α') where α' = 1/(2πT) is the Regge slope, T is string tension. In natural units: ℓ_s = 1/M_s where M_s is string mass scale. Relation to Planck scale depends on string coupling g_s and number of large dimensions. For weakly coupled Type II strings: ℓ_s = g_s^(1/4)·ℓ_P. For heterotic strings: ℓ_s ~ ℓ_P·√(α_GUT). String spectrum: E_n = √(n/α') for oscillator modes. Minimum mass ~ M_s unless supersymmetric ground state. Graviton is massless closed string mode. T-duality: For compact dimension of radius R, spectrum E² = (n/R)² + (mR/α')² + oscillators, where n is momentum mode, m is winding mode. Under R → α'/R: n ↔ m, so physics unchanged. This is an exact symmetry in perturbative string theory. Minimum probed distance: ΔxΔp ≥ ℏ plus string spreading Δx ≥ α'E/ℏ gives Δx_min ~ ℓ_s. High-energy string scattering: cross section grows with energy σ ~ α'E², unlike point-particle decrease σ ~ 1/E². UV divergences absent: string worldsheet replaces point-particle worldline; modular invariance ensures UV finiteness.",
