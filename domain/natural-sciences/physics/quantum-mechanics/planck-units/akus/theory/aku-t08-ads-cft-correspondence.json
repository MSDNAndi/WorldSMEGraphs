    "title": "AdS/CFT Correspondence: Holography and Emergent Spacetime",
    "abstract": "The Anti-de Sitter/Conformal Field Theory (AdS/CFT) correspondence is a conjectured exact equivalence between a theory of quantum gravity in (d+1)-dimensional anti-de Sitter space and a conformal field theory in d dimensions without gravity. It provides the most concrete realization of the holographic principle and suggests spacetime may be emergent.",
    "statement": {
      "text": "The AdS/CFT correspondence (Maldacena 1997) conjectures that Type IIB superstring theory on AdS₅ × S⁵ is exactly equivalent to N=4 Super Yang-Mills theory in 4D. More generally, quantum gravity in (d+1)-dimensional anti-de Sitter space is dual to a conformal field theory in d dimensions. The gravitational (bulk) physics is completely encoded in the lower-dimensional (boundary) theory without gravity.",
      "formula": "Z_gravity[AdS_{d+1}] = Z_CFT[∂AdS_{d+1}]",
      "interpretation": "Partition functions of bulk gravity and boundary CFT are identical",
      "key_example": "Type IIB string theory on AdS₅ × S⁵ ↔ N=4 SYM in 4D"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Imagine a hologram: a 2D surface encodes a 3D image. AdS/CFT says something similar happens with spacetime itself! A theory of quantum gravity in the 'bulk' (interior) is exactly equivalent to a non-gravitational quantum theory living on the 'boundary' (edge). All the information about bulk physics—black holes, gravitons, spacetime geometry—is encoded in the simpler boundary theory. This means gravity might not be fundamental but 'emerges' from quantum mechanics without gravity.",
      "key_insight": "The most profound implication: gravity = thermodynamics of entanglement. The emergence of bulk spacetime from boundary data is now understood through quantum entanglement. The Ryu-Takayanagi formula says geometric quantities (area) equal information-theoretic quantities (entropy). This provides the most concrete evidence that spacetime is emergent from quantum information.",
      "technical_details": "Original conjecture (Maldacena 1997): Type IIB superstring theory on AdS₅ × S⁵ with N units of 5-form flux is dual to N=4 Super Yang-Mills in 4D with gauge group SU(N). AdS radius L and string length ℓ_s satisfy L⁴/ℓ_s⁴ = g_s N where g_s is string coupling. Limits: (1) N → ∞ (planar limit): classical strings in AdS. (2) g_s N → ∞ (strong coupling): classical supergravity. Dictionary: bulk field φ(z,x) ↔ boundary operator O(x) with Δ = d/2 + √((d/2)² + m²L²). Boundary conditions: φ(z→0) ~ z^Δ_- φ_0 + z^Δ_+ ⟨O⟩. Correlation functions: ⟨O(x₁)...O(xₙ)⟩_CFT = δⁿ S_gravity[φ]/δφ₀(x₁)...δφ₀(xₙ). Planck scale role: ℓ_P/L ≪ 1 corresponds to classical gravity; quantum corrections appear as ℓ_P/L expansion.",
