    "statement": {
      "text": "Black hole thermodynamics is the theoretical framework that treats black holes as thermodynamic systems with temperature, entropy, and energy. The Bekenstein-Hawking entropy formula S = k_B·A/(4ℓ_P²) and the Hawking temperature T_H = ℏc³/(8πGMk_B) show that quantum mechanics and gravity combine to give black holes thermal properties. These discoveries provide the strongest hint that quantum gravity exists and connects geometry to information.",

        "entropy": "S = k_B·A/(4ℓ_P²) = k_B·c³A/(4Gℏ)",

      }
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Classically, black holes only absorb and never emit - they should have zero temperature. But Hawking showed that quantum effects near the horizon cause black holes to emit thermal radiation at temperature T_H, slowly evaporating over time. Meanwhile, Bekenstein showed that black holes have entropy proportional to their surface area, not volume. Together, these imply that black holes are quantum objects described by a finite number of microstates encoded on their horizon.",
      "key_insight": "Black hole thermodynamics reveals that gravity, quantum mechanics, and thermodynamics are deeply connected. The entropy formula S = A/(4ℓ_P²) (in natural units) tells us that one bit of information requires 4 Planck areas - this is the holographic principle. The temperature formula shows all black holes eventually evaporate. The 'area theorem' (dA ≥ 0) is the second law. These remarkable connections suggest Planck units are fundamental to nature, not just convenient.",
      "technical_details": "Bekenstein (1972-73) argued black holes must have entropy to prevent second law violations. Hawking (1974-75) showed quantum field theory in curved spacetime predicts thermal emission at T_H = ℏc³/(8πGMk_B) = (ℏc/4πk_B)·κ where κ is surface gravity. The entropy S_BH = k_B·A/(4ℓ_P²) follows from T·dS = dM (first law). For a Schwarzschild black hole: M = m_P²c²/E_P = (c²/2G)·r_S, T_H ∝ 1/M (smaller is hotter!), S_BH ∝ M² (larger has more entropy). Evaporation time: τ ∝ M³ - stellar mass black holes last ~10⁶⁷ years.",
