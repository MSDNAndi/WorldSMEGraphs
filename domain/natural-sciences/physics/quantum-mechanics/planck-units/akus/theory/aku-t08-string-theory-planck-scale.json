    "statement": {
      "text": "String theory naturally incorporates a minimum length scale (the string length ℓ_s) comparable to the Planck length. One-dimensional vibrating strings replace point particles, with different vibrational modes corresponding to different particles. The theory predicts T-duality (physics at radius R is equivalent to physics at radius ℓ_s²/R), extra spatial dimensions, and a natural UV cutoff that tames quantum gravity infinities.",
      "formal": "Fundamental objects are 1D strings with length ℓ_s ~ ℓ_P; T-duality: R ↔ ℓ_s²/R",

        "No UV divergences"
      ]
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "In string theory, the fundamental building blocks aren't zero-dimensional points but tiny one-dimensional vibrating strings. Just as a guitar string produces different notes at different harmonics, a fundamental string produces different particles at different vibrational modes - including the graviton that mediates gravity. Since strings have finite size (~10⁻³⁵ m), you can't probe distances smaller than the string itself. This naturally provides the minimum length that quantum gravity seems to require.",
      "key_insight": "String theory elegantly solves the UV divergence problem of quantum gravity. In point-particle theories, virtual particle loops at short distances create infinite contributions. But strings 'smear out' interactions over their finite length, cutting off the infinities. The string length ℓ_s acts as a natural regulator. T-duality is remarkable: trying to probe distances smaller than ℓ_s is physically equivalent to probing larger distances - there's literally no 'smaller than ℓ_s' in string theory.",
      "technical_details": "The string length is ℓ_s = √(α') where α' is the Regge slope parameter. For realistic theories, ℓ_s ~ ℓ_P (within a few orders of magnitude). The mass spectrum of string excitations follows m² = (n-1)/α' where n is the excitation level. The massless graviton corresponds to n=1 for closed strings. T-duality states that a string on a circle of radius R is equivalent to a string on a circle of radius α'/R = ℓ_s²/R. Extra dimensions (typically 6 or 7 compactified) are required for consistency - these are curled up at ~ℓ_s scale.",
      "common_misconceptions": [
