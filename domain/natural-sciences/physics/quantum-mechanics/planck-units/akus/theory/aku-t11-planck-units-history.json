    "statement": {
      "text": "Max Planck introduced natural units in 1899, one year before his famous blackbody radiation paper. He recognized that combining the fundamental constants G, ℏ (then h), and c yields unique units of length, time, and mass that are 'independent of any arbitrary choice of bodies or substances' - universal constants that would be recognized by any civilization in the universe.",
      "original_publication": "Über irreversible Strahlungsvorgänge (1899)",
      "motivation": "To find units that transcend anthropocentric choices"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Before Planck, all units were based on arbitrary human choices: the meter from Earth's circumference, the second from Earth's rotation, the kilogram from water density. Planck realized that three fundamental constants - G (gravity), c (light speed), and h (action quantum) - could be combined to create length, time, and mass units that are truly universal. Any intelligent beings, anywhere in the universe, measuring these constants would derive the same Planck units.",
      "key_insight": "Planck's genius was recognizing that the constants G, c, and h are not just parameters in equations but define absolute scales of nature. He wrote: 'These units retain their meaning as long as the law of gravitation and the velocity of light and the two principles of thermodynamics remain valid.' This was decades before quantum gravity - Planck intuited that these scales would be fundamental.",
      "historical_context": "When Planck introduced these units in 1899, quantum mechanics didn't exist (his blackbody paper was 1900). General relativity was 16 years away (1915). The idea that these scales represent quantum gravity was not understood until much later - yet Planck somehow chose exactly the right constants."
