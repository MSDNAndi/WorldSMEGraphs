      "text": "Planck units represent nature's fundamental scales rather than arbitrary human-centric measurements. They reveal what is truly fundamental through dimensionless ratios: only dimensionless constants like the fine structure constant α ≈ 1/137 are physically meaningful, while dimensional constants like the electron charge are merely conversion factors between human units. Planck proposed these units in 1899, before quantum mechanics and general relativity were fully developed, showing their deep connection to the structure of physical law.",

    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "When aliens measure the universe, they won't use meters or seconds - those are human inventions based on Earth's size and rotation. But they will discover the same dimensionless numbers we do: α ≈ 1/137, proton-to-electron mass ratio ≈ 1836, etc. These numbers don't depend on unit choices. Planck units are special because they make all the fundamental dimensional constants equal to 1, revealing which ratios are truly fundamental.",
      "key_insight": "The deep insight is that dimensional constants (like c, ℏ, G) don't describe nature - they describe our arbitrary choice of units. Nature speaks in dimensionless numbers. Planck units are the 'native language' where dimensional clutter disappears and fundamental structure emerges. The fact that three seemingly unrelated constants (c from relativity, ℏ from quantum mechanics, G from gravity) combine naturally suggests a deeper unity.",
      "technical_details": "A dimensionless constant is a pure number independent of unit system (e.g., π, α, mass ratios). A dimensional constant like c = 299,792,458 m/s appears to have a specific value only because we chose specific units (meters, seconds). In Planck units, c = 1 is dimensionless, and the meaningful physics is in ratios like v/c. Planck recognized in 1899 that combining ℏ, G, c (and later k_B) produces natural scales: ℓₚ, tₚ, mₚ, Tₚ. These are the characteristic scales where quantum gravity becomes important.",
