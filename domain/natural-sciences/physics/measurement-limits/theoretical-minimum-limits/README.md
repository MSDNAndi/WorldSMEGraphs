# Theoretical Minimum Limits

This domain explores the **theoretical minimum values** for physical quantities according to current physics theories. Unlike measurable minimums (which depend on detector technology), these are fundamental limits imposed by the structure of physics itself.

## Key Insight: Three Categories of Theoretical Limits

### 1. Quantized Minimums (Discrete)
Some quantities have genuine minimum values due to quantization:
- **Charge**: Elementary charge e (fractional quarks confined)
- **Angular momentum**: ℏ/2 for fermions
- **Action**: ℏ (Planck's constant)
- **Photon energy at given frequency**: hν (single quantum)

### 2. Spacetime Limits (Possibly Fundamental)
Planck scale may represent genuine minima for spacetime quantities:
- **Length**: Planck length l_P ≈ 1.6×10⁻³⁵ m (possibly fundamental)
- **Time**: Planck time t_P ≈ 5.4×10⁻⁴⁴ s (possibly fundamental)

### 3. Theory-Dependent Limits
Limits that depend on which theory is correct:
- **Mass**: Possibly massless (photon) or minimum mass (if GUP correct)
- **Temperature**: Possibly no minimum (classical) or discrete (LQG)
- **Force**: Possibly no fundamental minimum
- **Voltage, Current, Fields**: May be continuous down to zero

## AKU Coverage

| Quantity | Theoretical Minimum | Source Theory |
|----------|---------------------|---------------|
| Length | l_P = 1.6×10⁻³⁵ m | Quantum gravity (speculative) |
| Time | t_P = 5.4×10⁻⁴⁴ s | Quantum gravity (speculative) |
| Charge | e = 1.6×10⁻¹⁹ C | QED + Quark confinement |
| Angular momentum | ℏ/2 = 5.3×10⁻³⁵ J·s | Quantum mechanics |
| Action | ℏ = 1.05×10⁻³⁴ J·s | Quantum mechanics |
| Energy | 0 (vacuum) or hν | Quantum field theory |
| Mass | 0 (photon) | Standard Model |
| Temperature | 0 K (unattainable) | Thermodynamics |
| Force | 0 N (in principle) | Classical + QM |
| Momentum | 0 or Δp·Δx ≥ ℏ/2 | Uncertainty principle |

## Relationship to Planck Units

**Critical distinction**: Planck units are NOT generally theoretical minimums!

| Planck Unit | Minimum? | Explanation |
|-------------|----------|-------------|
| Planck length | ✅ Possibly | May be spacetime granularity |
| Planck time | ✅ Possibly | May be temporal quantum |
| Planck mass | ❌ NO | Actually quite LARGE (~10⁻⁸ kg) |
| Planck energy | ❌ NO | Actually ENORMOUS (~10⁹ J) |
| Planck temperature | ❌ NO | Is a MAXIMUM, not minimum |
| Planck charge | ❌ NO | Larger than e by factor 11.7 |
| Planck force | ❌ NO | c⁴/G is ENORMOUS |
