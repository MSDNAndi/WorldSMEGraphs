    "statement": {
      "text": "Cosmic inflation is a theory proposing that the universe underwent a period of exponential expansion in the first fraction of a second after the Big Bang (approximately 10^-36 to 10^-32 seconds). During inflation, the universe expanded by at least 60 e-foldings (a factor of ~10^26), solving several cosmological puzzles.",

    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Imagine a tiny wrinkled balloon suddenly inflating to the size of a galaxy in an instant. Any wrinkles (inhomogeneities) would be stretched smooth, and regions that were once in contact would now be far apart. This explains why distant parts of the universe look so similar.",
