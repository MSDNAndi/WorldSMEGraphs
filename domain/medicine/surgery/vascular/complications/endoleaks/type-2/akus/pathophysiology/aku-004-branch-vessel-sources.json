    "statement": {
      "text": "Type 2 endoleaks most commonly arise from lumbar arteries (60-70% of cases) and the inferior mesenteric artery (25-30% of cases), with these vessels maintaining perfusion via extensive collateral networks from the internal iliac, intercostal, and mesenteric arterial systems.",
      "formal": "Source Vessels: Lumbar arteries (paired, L1-L5) >> IMA (midline, L3) > Accessory renal arteries > Median sacral artery | Collateral inflow determines Type 2 persistence"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Think of the abdominal aorta like a main highway with multiple exit ramps (branch vessels). When you place the stent-graft, you close these exits from the main road. But these exits are also connected to a network of side streets (collaterals). Blood can still reach these exits by taking the side streets, then flow backward into the old aneurysm space.",
      "key_insight": "Understanding which vessels cause Type 2 endoleaks and their collateral sources is critical for planning embolization procedures - you need to block both the vessel feeding the sac AND its collateral supply to achieve durable closure.",
      "technical_details": "The likelihood of Type 2 endoleak correlates with the number and caliber of patent branch vessels. Each lumbar artery pair receives collateral flow from the ipsilateral internal iliac artery via the iliolumbar artery. The IMA receives collateral flow from the superior mesenteric artery via the marginal artery of Drummond and from the internal iliac arteries via the superior hemorrhoidal artery."
