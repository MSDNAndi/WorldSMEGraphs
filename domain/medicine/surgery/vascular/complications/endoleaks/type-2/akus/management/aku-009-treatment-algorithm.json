    "statement": {
      "text": "Type 2 endoleak management is primarily based on aneurysm sac behavior: observation for stable or decreasing sac size, intervention (typically embolization) for persistent endoleak with sac expansion >5mm or absolute diameter >60mm at 6-12 months.",
      "formal": "Management Algorithm: Stable sac → Observe | Growing sac (>5mm OR >60mm absolute) at 6+ months → Intervene (embolization preferred) | Rapid growth or symptoms → Urgent intervention"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "The key principle is that not all Type 2 endoleaks need treatment - what matters is whether the aneurysm sac is growing. If the sac is stable or shrinking, just watch it. If it's growing significantly, then treat the endoleak to prevent rupture.",
      "key_insight": "Time is therapeutic: ~50% of Type 2 endoleaks resolve spontaneously within 6 months. The challenge is identifying the subset that will persist and cause sac expansion while avoiding unnecessary interventions in those that will resolve.",
      "technical_details": "The management paradigm shifted from treating all Type 2 endoleaks (older approach) to selective intervention based on sac behavior (current evidence-based approach). This reduces unnecessary procedures while maintaining safety."
