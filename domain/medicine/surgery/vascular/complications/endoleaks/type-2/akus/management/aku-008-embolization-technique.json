    "statement": {
      "text": "Type 2 endoleak embolization can be performed via transarterial approach (accessing feeding vessels through arterial circulation) or translumbar approach (direct percutaneous puncture of aneurysm sac), using coils and/or liquid embolic agents to occlude the endoleak circuit.",
      "formal": "Embolization: [Transarterial (via collaterals) OR Translumbar (direct sac puncture)] + [Coils AND/OR Liquid embolic] → Endoleak occlusion (60-85% success, 20-40% recurrence)"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Embolization is like plugging a leak by either (1) going through the plumbing system to reach the leak (transarterial), or (2) sticking a needle directly through the wall to the leak (translumbar). You fill the space with metal coils or liquid glue to block blood flow.",
      "key_insight": "The key to successful Type 2 embolization is treating BOTH inflow and outflow vessels. If you only plug the inflow, blood can still enter through the outflow vessel running backward. This is why identifying the complete endoleak circuit is critical.",
      "technical_details": "Success rates vary by approach: transarterial 60-70%, translumbar 70-85%, but translumbar has higher complication risk. Recurrence is common (20-40%) because collateral vessels can recruit new pathways. Liquid embolic agents (Onyx, n-BCA) may provide better sac penetration than coils alone."
