    "statement": {
      "text": "Type 2 endoleak on CT angiography (CTA) appears as contrast enhancement within the aneurysm sac outside the stent-graft lumen on arterial phase imaging, with identifiable feeding and/or draining vessels separate from the attachment zones.",
      "formal": "CTA Diagnosis: Contrast in perigraft space + Arterial phase timing + Identifiable branch vessels + Remote from attachment zones = Type 2 Endoleak"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "On a CT scan with contrast, you see the stent-graft (the metal framework) sitting inside the aorta with bright white contrast inside it (flowing blood). If you also see contrast (white areas) in the space between the graft and the old aneurysm wall, connected to small branch vessels, that's a Type 2 endoleak.",
      "key_insight": "The key to diagnosing Type 2 (versus Type 1) is seeing the contrast enhancement away from the attachment sites and being able to trace it to aortic branch vessels like lumbar arteries or the IMA. This requires carefully examining all phases of the CTA.",
      "technical_details": "Type 2 endoleaks may appear on arterial phase (immediate imaging) or may only become apparent on delayed phase imaging (90-180 seconds post-contrast) as collateral flow is slower than systemic flow. Multi-phase imaging improves detection sensitivity from ~80% to >95%."
