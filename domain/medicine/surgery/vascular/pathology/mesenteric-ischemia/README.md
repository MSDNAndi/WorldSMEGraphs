# Mesenteric Ischemia Knowledge Domain

> **Version**: 1.0  
> **Status**: Core Complete  
> **Last Updated**: 2025-12-30  
> **Domain Path**: medicine/surgery/vascular/pathology/mesenteric-ischemia

## Overview

This domain contains comprehensive knowledge on mesenteric ischemia, covering both acute and chronic forms of the disease. The content is designed from the perspective of an experienced academic vascular surgeon and is suitable for vascular surgeons, general surgeons, surgical trainees, and other medical professionals involved in the care of patients with mesenteric vascular disease.

## Clinical Significance

Mesenteric ischemia remains one of the most lethal conditions in vascular surgery:
- **Acute Mesenteric Ischemia (AMI)**: 50-80% mortality
- **Nonocclusive Mesenteric Ischemia (NOMI)**: 70-90% mortality  
- **Mesenteric Venous Thrombosis (MVT)**: 20-50% mortality
- **Chronic Mesenteric Ischemia (CMI)**: 5-10% operative mortality with excellent long-term outcomes

### Rendered Content

#### Book Chapter: "Mesenteric Ischemia: Dilemmas in Diagnosis, Treatment, and Decision-Making"

**Location**: `.renders/english/book-chapter-surgical-dilemmas.md`

A comprehensive ~25-30 page book chapter suitable for a surgical textbook or reference on dilemmas in surgery. The chapter covers:

1. **The Diagnostic Dilemma**: Challenges in recognizing mesenteric ischemia
2. **The Treatment Dilemma**: Open vs endovascular approach selection
3. **The Intraoperative Dilemma**: Bowel viability assessment
4. **The Resection Dilemma**: How much bowel to remove
5. **Special Populations**: NOMI, MVT, CMI
6. **Outcomes and Long-Term Considerations**
7. **The Human Element**: Communicating with families
8. **Case-Based Learning**: Learning from failure

**Target Audience**: 
- Vascular surgeons
- General surgeons
- Surgical residents and fellows
- Academic surgeons

**Format**: Markdown, suitable for conversion to PDF, LaTeX, or other formats

## Key Themes

### Surgical Dilemmas Addressed

1. **When to suspect mesenteric ischemia?** The "pain out of proportion to examination" paradigm and its limitations

2. **Endovascular or open surgery?** Balancing minimally invasive revascularization against the need to assess bowel viability

3. **Is the bowel viable?** Using clinical signs, adjunctive technologies, and second-look laparotomy

4. **How much to resect?** Balancing adequate margins against short bowel syndrome risk

5. **When is surgery futile?** Massive necrosis and goals-of-care decisions

### Clinical Pearls

- Anticoagulation should be started immediately upon clinical suspicion - do not wait for imaging
- CT angiography is the diagnostic cornerstone - obtain emergently
- The single most important prognostic factor is the presence of bowel necrosis
- When in doubt about bowel viability, plan a second-look laparotomy
- NOMI is the silent killer of the ICU - think of it in patients on vasopressors with rising lactate
