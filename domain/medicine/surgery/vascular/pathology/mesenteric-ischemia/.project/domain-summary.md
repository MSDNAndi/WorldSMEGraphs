## Key Themes for Book Chapter

### The Dilemmas Framework

The book chapter should be organized around key dilemmas:

1. **The Diagnostic Dilemma**: When to suspect and how to confirm
2. **The Approach Dilemma**: Open vs endovascular
3. **The Viability Dilemma**: What to resect
4. **The Timing Dilemma**: When to intervene
5. **The Resource Dilemma**: Transfer vs treat locally
6. **The Goals Dilemma**: When to pursue palliation

### Key Clinical Pearls

1. "Pain out of proportion" is classic but often absent
2. Normal lactate does NOT exclude early AMI
3. CTA is the diagnostic cornerstone—order liberally
4. Atrial fibrillation + abdominal pain = AMI until proven otherwise
5. When in doubt about viability, plan second-look
6. Speed of diagnosis matters more than choice of treatment
7. NOMI is the silent killer of the ICU

### Evidence Gaps to Acknowledge

- No RCTs comparing open vs endovascular for AMI
- Biomarkers not yet clinically validated
- Optimal anticoagulation duration for MVT uncertain
- Viability assessment adjuncts improve accuracy but not standardized
