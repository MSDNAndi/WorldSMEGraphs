    "statement": {
      "text": "Mesenteric ischemia carries among the highest mortality rates of any surgical emergency, with acute arterial occlusion reaching 50-80% in-hospital mortality despite treatment, primarily due to delayed diagnosis, and chronic disease carrying 5-10% operative mortality with excellent long-term survival after successful revascularization.",
      "formal": "Mortality Spectrum: AMI arterial (50-80%) > NOMI (70-90%) > MVT (20-50%) >> CMI elective (5-10%)"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Mesenteric ischemia mortality is a race between disease progression and intervention. Acute disease kills quickly because the bowel dies in hours, diagnosis is often delayed, and patients are typically elderly with significant comorbidities. Chronic disease allows time for diagnosis and planned intervention, explaining the dramatic mortality difference.",
      "key_insight": "The high mortality in AMI is predominantly driven by delay - delay in considering the diagnosis, delay in obtaining imaging, and delay in reaching the operating room. Studies consistently show that time from symptom onset to revascularization is the strongest predictor of survival. This is a disease where hours matter."
