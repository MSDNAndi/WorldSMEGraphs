    "statement": {
      "text": "Quality of life outcomes after mesenteric ischemia treatment depend heavily on the clinical context: successful revascularization for CMI typically results in excellent functional recovery and weight gain, while survivors of acute mesenteric ischemia often face prolonged recovery, nutritional challenges, and significant psychological impact from their life-threatening illness.",
      "formal": "QoL Outcomes: CMI post-revascularization → Weight gain, symptom resolution, near-normal QoL; AMI survivors → Variable QoL depending on bowel loss, often prolonged recovery; SBS → Severely impaired QoL initially, adaptation possible"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Mesenteric ischemia's impact extends far beyond survival. Chronic ischemia patients may have endured months of pain, food fear, and malnutrition—successful treatment can be transformative. Acute ischemia survivors may face the physical and psychological aftermath of near-death, bowel resection, ostomies, and dependence on parenteral nutrition.",
      "key_insight": "Quality of life is increasingly recognized as a critical outcome metric, not just survival. For CMI, QoL improvement is often the primary treatment goal. For AMI survivors, QoL considerations may inform aggressive vs. palliative approaches.",
      "technical_details": "Standardized QoL instruments (SF-36, EQ-5D) have been applied to mesenteric ischemia populations, though data remain limited. Disease-specific instruments are lacking. Nutritional status (BMI, albumin) correlates with functional QoL."
