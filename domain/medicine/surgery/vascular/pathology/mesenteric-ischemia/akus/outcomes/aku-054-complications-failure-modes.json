      "text": "Complications following treatment of mesenteric ischemia include both procedure-specific failures (rethrombosis, anastomotic leak, wound complications) and systemic decompensation (sepsis, multi-organ failure, ARDS); anticipating and recognizing these complications early is essential for salvage, and failure modes analysis informs quality improvement.",
      "formal": "Complications: (1) Vascular: Rethrombosis, graft failure, stent thrombosis; (2) Bowel: Anastomotic leak, stricture, SBS; (3) Systemic: Sepsis, MOF, ARDS, AKI; (4) Wound: Infection, dehiscence, fistula"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Even when the initial operation succeeds, the patient with mesenteric ischemia isn't out of the woods. The combination of ischemia-reperfusion injury, bacterial translocation, and the stress of major surgery creates a perfect storm for complications. Understanding what can go wrong—and watching for early signs—gives the best chance for salvage.",
      "key_insight": "Many complications after mesenteric ischemia treatment are related to the underlying systemic insult, not the technical procedure. Even a technically perfect revascularization cannot undo the inflammatory cascade already set in motion by bowel ischemia. This is why mortality remains high despite successful treatment.",
      "technical_details": "Rethrombosis typically occurs early (first 30 days) and presents with return of symptoms. Anastomotic leaks present with sepsis, pain, and may be subtle initially. Multi-organ failure is the common final pathway in many deaths."
