      "text": "Mesenteric ischemia following aortic surgery represents a distinct clinical entity with unique pathophysiology (IMA ligation/coverage, embolization, hypoperfusion), specific risk factors, and a particularly lethal prognosis; early recognition and intervention are essential as mortality exceeds 50% when bowel necrosis develops.",
      "formal": "Post-Aortic Surgery MI: Open AAA (IMA ligation) → Colonic ischemia 1-7%; EVAR (IMA coverage, embolization) → Colonic ischemia 1-3%; Thoracoabdominal repair → Higher risk; Mortality if necrosis: 50-90%"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Aortic surgery disrupts the mesenteric circulation in predictable ways—ligation or coverage of the IMA, manipulation causing embolization, clamp-related hypoperfusion, and loss of hypogastric perfusion. The left colon and sigmoid are most vulnerable because they are watershed areas. Post-operative ileus masks early symptoms.",
      "key_insight": "The key to preventing catastrophic outcomes is proactive surveillance in the first 48-72 hours post-procedure: flexible sigmoidoscopy for at-risk patients, attention to early warning signs (bloody diarrhea, distension, unexplained acidosis), and willingness to re-explore promptly.",
      "technical_details": "IMA reimplantation is protective but not always feasible. Patent IMA with good backbleeding suggests adequate collateral circulation. SMA and hypogastric artery patency are critical determinants of left colon perfusion when IMA is sacrificed."
