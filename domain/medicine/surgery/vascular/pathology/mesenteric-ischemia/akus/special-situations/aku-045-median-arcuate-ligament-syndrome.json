    "statement": {
      "text": "Median arcuate ligament syndrome (MALS) is a controversial cause of chronic mesenteric symptoms resulting from extrinsic compression of the celiac artery by the diaphragmatic crus; diagnosis requires correlation of anatomic compression with clinical symptoms, exclusion of other causes, and careful patient selection for intervention.",
      "formal": "MALS: Celiac artery compression by median arcuate ligament → Postprandial pain (often atypical) → Treatment: Laparoscopic or open ligament release ± celiac revascularization → Success rate 50-80% (variable)"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "The median arcuate ligament is a fibrous arch connecting the diaphragmatic crura. In some individuals, it sits lower than usual and compresses the celiac artery origin, especially during expiration. The controversy is whether this anatomic finding actually causes symptoms—compression is common on imaging, but symptomatic MALS is rare.",
      "key_insight": "The key challenge in MALS is distinguishing truly symptomatic compression from incidental findings. Many patients have celiac compression without symptoms, and many with classic MALS symptoms have underlying functional GI disorders. Success depends on meticulous patient selection.",
      "technical_details": "Dynamic imaging (CTA or MRA with respiratory variation) can demonstrate exaggerated compression during expiration. Celiac plexus involvement (neuropathic component) may explain some of the symptoms and the variable response to purely vascular decompression."
