    "statement": {
      "text": "Open surgical revascularization for mesenteric ischemia includes embolectomy (for acute embolic occlusion), bypass grafting (for thrombotic or chronic disease), and endarterectomy, with the choice of procedure depending on etiology, anatomic factors, and need for concurrent bowel assessment or resection.",
      "formal": "Open Mesenteric Revascularization: Embolectomy (acute embolic) OR Bypass (chronic/thrombotic) OR Endarterectomy (aortic origin disease) ± Bowel assessment/resection"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Open surgery for mesenteric ischemia is like plumbing work on the body's digestive blood supply. If something is stuck in the pipe (embolus), you can fish it out. If the pipe is clogged at its origin (atherosclerosis), you can either clean it out or bypass it entirely with a new pipe. The advantage of open surgery is that you can directly see and handle the bowel to assess viability.",
      "key_insight": "The decision between open and endovascular revascularization is not just about the vessel - it's about the patient and the bowel. Open surgery allows direct bowel assessment and second-look laparotomy, making it preferable when bowel viability is uncertain. Endovascular-first approach is gaining favor in stable patients with viable bowel.",
      "technical_details": "SMA revascularization requires careful attention to inflow (aorta) and target vessel quality. Antegrade bypass from supraceliac aorta provides superior long-term patency but requires supraceliac clamping. Retrograde bypass from iliac artery is technically easier but has lower patency. Prosthetic conduit (PTFE, Dacron) is acceptable when the field is not grossly contaminated."
