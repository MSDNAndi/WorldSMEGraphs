    "statement": {
      "text": "Chronic Mesenteric Ischemia (CMI), also known as intestinal angina, is a condition of inadequate postprandial intestinal blood flow caused by progressive atherosclerotic narrowing of the mesenteric arteries, classically presenting with postprandial abdominal pain, food fear, and significant weight loss.",
      "formal": "CMI: Progressive mesenteric arterial stenosis → Inadequate postprandial blood flow augmentation → Relative ischemia → Postprandial pain → Food avoidance → Malnutrition"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Just as angina pectoris represents inadequate coronary blood flow during increased cardiac demand, intestinal angina represents inadequate mesenteric blood flow during the increased demand of digestion. The intestine 'cramps' after eating because it cannot get enough blood to digest the meal.",
      "key_insight": "CMI is remarkably rare despite the high prevalence of mesenteric atherosclerosis because of extensive collateral networks between the celiac, SMA, and IMA. Typically, two of the three major vessels must be severely stenosed or occluded before symptoms develop. This same collateral network makes CMI amenable to single-vessel revascularization.",
      "technical_details": "The mesenteric circulation has robust collateral pathways: (1) pancreaticoduodenal arcades connecting celiac and SMA, (2) marginal artery of Drummond and arc of Riolan connecting SMA and IMA, (3) hemorrhoidal circulation connecting IMA to internal iliacs. These collaterals can maintain adequate baseline flow but fail to meet the 50-100% increase in blood flow required for digestion."
