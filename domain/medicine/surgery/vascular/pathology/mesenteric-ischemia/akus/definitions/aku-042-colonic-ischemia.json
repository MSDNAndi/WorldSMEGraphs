    "statement": {
      "text": "Colonic ischemia (ischemic colitis) is the most common form of intestinal ischemia, typically affecting the watershed areas of the colon (splenic flexure and rectosigmoid junction), often occurring in elderly patients after hypotensive episodes or aortic surgery, with a spectrum ranging from self-limited mucosal ischemia to transmural necrosis requiring surgery.",
      "formal": "Colonic Ischemia: Reduced colonic blood flow → Mucosal injury (mild) → Submucosal hemorrhage/edema → Transmural necrosis (severe) → Perforation/Peritonitis (catastrophic)"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "The colon is a long tube with vulnerable 'weak spots' where blood supply overlaps from different sources. These watershed areas - the splenic flexure and the junction between sigmoid and rectum - are the first to suffer when blood flow drops. Most cases are mild and self-healing, but severe cases can be life-threatening.",
      "key_insight": "Unlike small bowel mesenteric ischemia which is usually arterial occlusion, colonic ischemia is most often nonocclusive - resulting from low-flow states rather than blockage. This is why it commonly occurs after aortic surgery (IMA ligation) or in patients with hypotension/shock.",
      "technical_details": "The colon is supplied by the SMA (proximal), IMA (distal), and hypogastric arteries (rectum). The marginal artery of Drummond and arc of Riolan provide collateral flow. Watershed areas at the splenic flexure (SMA-IMA junction) and rectosigmoid (IMA-hypogastric junction) have the most tenuous blood supply."
