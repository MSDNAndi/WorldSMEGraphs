    "statement": {
      "text": "Acute Mesenteric Ischemia (AMI) is a life-threatening surgical emergency characterized by sudden interruption of intestinal blood flow, most commonly due to arterial embolism or thrombosis to the superior mesenteric artery, requiring urgent diagnosis and intervention to prevent bowel necrosis.",
      "formal": "AMI: Sudden mesenteric blood flow interruption → Intestinal hypoxia → Progressive ischemic cascade → Transmural necrosis (6-12 hours) → Perforation/Sepsis → Multi-organ failure/Death"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Acute mesenteric ischemia is the intestinal equivalent of a heart attack or stroke - a sudden blockage of blood flow to a vital organ with a very narrow time window for intervention. Unlike a limb, which can tolerate hours of ischemia, the intestine begins irreversible damage within 6 hours.",
      "key_insight": "The phrase 'pain out of proportion to examination' captures the diagnostic challenge: patients present with severe, often diffuse abdominal pain, but physical examination is deceptively benign until peritonitis develops. By the time peritoneal signs appear, bowel necrosis has already occurred.",
      "technical_details": "The ischemic cascade involves: (1) mucosal hypoxia within minutes, (2) villous injury and barrier breakdown within 1-2 hours, (3) bacterial translocation and reperfusion injury, (4) transmural necrosis by 6-12 hours, (5) perforation and peritonitis. The SMA is most commonly affected due to its acute angle of origin from the aorta, making it a preferred landing site for emboli."
