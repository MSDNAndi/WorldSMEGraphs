    "statement": {
      "text": "Laboratory findings in mesenteric ischemia are supportive but not diagnostic, with elevated lactate, metabolic acidosis, and leukocytosis suggesting established bowel ischemia while normal values do not exclude early disease; no biomarker is sufficiently sensitive or specific to diagnose or rule out AMI.",
      "formal": "Laboratory Role: Not diagnostic → Supportive of clinical suspicion → Guides resuscitation → Risk stratification → Serial monitoring"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Think of labs as the 'canary in the coal mine' - they can tell you that something is very wrong, but they cannot tell you exactly what or where. A high lactate confirms what you already suspect (sick bowel), but a normal lactate doesn't mean the bowel is fine - it may just mean the ischemia hasn't progressed far enough yet.",
      "key_insight": "The most important laboratory principle in AMI is that normal labs do NOT rule out the diagnosis. Lactate rises as ischemia progresses; early reversible ischemia may have completely normal labs. If clinical suspicion is high, proceed to imaging regardless of lab values."
