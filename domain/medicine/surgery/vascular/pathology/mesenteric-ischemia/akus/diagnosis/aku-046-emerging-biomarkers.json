      "text": "Emerging biomarkers for mesenteric ischemia—particularly intestinal fatty acid binding protein (I-FABP) and citrulline—show promise for earlier diagnosis and monitoring of intestinal injury, though none have achieved widespread clinical validation to replace imaging as the diagnostic standard.",
      "formal": "Emerging Biomarkers: I-FABP (sensitivity 79-90%, specificity 80-91%)—released from ischemic enterocytes; Citrulline (low levels correlate with enterocyte mass loss); D-lactate (bacterial origin, late marker); None yet validated for routine clinical use"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "The holy grail of mesenteric ischemia diagnosis would be a blood test that detects intestinal injury before irreversible necrosis occurs. Current markers like lactate and leukocytosis are nonspecific and rise late. Newer biomarkers like I-FABP are more specific to the gut and may provide an earlier signal.",
      "key_insight": "I-FABP is the most promising emerging biomarker—it's released from damaged enterocytes and can be detected in blood and urine within hours of ischemic injury. However, it's not yet commercially available in most hospitals, and cutoff values are not standardized.",
      "technical_details": "I-FABP is a small cytoplasmic protein found exclusively in mature enterocytes. It's released when cell membrane integrity is compromised. Half-life is short (11 minutes), so levels reflect active injury. Citrulline is synthesized by enterocytes from glutamine; low levels indicate reduced enterocyte mass."
