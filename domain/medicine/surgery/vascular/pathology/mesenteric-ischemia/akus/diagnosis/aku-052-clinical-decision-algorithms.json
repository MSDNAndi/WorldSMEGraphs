      "text": "Clinical decision algorithms and scoring systems for mesenteric ischemia aim to improve early recognition by incorporating risk factors, clinical features, and laboratory values; while no single tool has achieved widespread validation, algorithmic approaches can help standardize recognition and reduce diagnostic delays.",
      "formal": "Decision Support Components: (1) Risk factor assessment (AF, CAD, prior thromboembolic events); (2) Clinical suspicion triggers (pain-exam gap, acute deterioration); (3) Laboratory thresholds (lactate, D-dimer); (4) Imaging decision points; (5) Treatment pathways"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "The challenge of diagnosing mesenteric ischemia is that it's rare, mimics common conditions, and is lethal if missed. Decision algorithms attempt to systematize the thought process: 'this constellation of features should trigger this action.' They don't replace clinical judgment but provide guardrails against anchoring bias and diagnostic delays.",
      "key_insight": "The goal of decision support isn't to achieve a definitive diagnosis—it's to identify patients who warrant urgent imaging. The cost of a negative CTA is trivial compared to the cost of missing AMI. Algorithms should err on the side of over-imaging.",
      "technical_details": "Most proposed scoring systems combine risk factors (age, AF, vascular disease) with clinical features (pain out of proportion, acute onset) and labs (lactate, D-dimer). None have been prospectively validated in large cohorts due to the rarity of the disease."
