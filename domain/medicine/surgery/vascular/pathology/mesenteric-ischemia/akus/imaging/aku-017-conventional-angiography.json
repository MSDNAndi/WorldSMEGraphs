    "statement": {
      "text": "Conventional catheter-based angiography (digital subtraction angiography, DSA) remains the gold standard for mesenteric vascular imaging with unparalleled spatial and temporal resolution, though its invasive nature has relegated it primarily to cases requiring immediate endovascular intervention or when non-invasive imaging is inconclusive.",
      "formal": "DSA Indications: (1) When CTA inconclusive, (2) When endovascular treatment planned, (3) For pressure measurements or provocative testing; Advantages: Real-time flow assessment, immediate intervention capability; Disadvantages: Invasive, contrast nephrotoxicity, access complications"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "While CTA has largely replaced diagnostic angiography for mesenteric ischemia, catheter angiography offers unique advantages: real-time visualization of flow dynamics, the ability to selectively catheterize vessels, and immediate transition to therapy. In the hybrid OR era, angiography is often the first step of an intervention rather than a standalone diagnostic test.",
      "key_insight": "The modern role of conventional angiography is primarily therapeutic rather than purely diagnostic. When mesenteric ischemia is strongly suspected and intervention is planned, proceeding directly to the angiography suite allows diagnosis and treatment in a single session.",
      "technical_details": "Selective mesenteric angiography requires catheterization of the celiac, SMA, and IMA origins. DSA technique with rapid frame acquisition is essential for optimal visualization. CO2 angiography is an alternative for patients with severe renal impairment."
