    "statement": {
      "text": "Mesenteric Venous Thrombosis (MVT) is thrombosis of the superior mesenteric vein and/or portal vein system, causing intestinal ischemia through venous congestion, impaired arterial inflow, and ultimately hemorrhagic infarction, with a more insidious onset and better prognosis than arterial occlusion when diagnosed early.",
      "formal": "MVT: Venous occlusion → Venous congestion → Increased capillary pressure → Bowel wall edema → Impaired arterial inflow → Hemorrhagic infarction"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "While arterial occlusion is like turning off the faucet, venous thrombosis is like blocking the drain. Blood can still get in, but it cannot get out. The intestine becomes waterlogged and swollen, and eventually the congestion becomes so severe that even the arterial blood cannot get in. The result is a hemorrhagic (bloody) infarct rather than the pale infarct seen with arterial occlusion.",
      "key_insight": "MVT is the most forgiving form of mesenteric ischemia. Its more gradual onset (days rather than hours) allows time for diagnosis and initiation of anticoagulation, which can prevent progression and allow many patients to avoid surgery entirely. The key is early diagnosis and prompt anticoagulation.",
      "technical_details": "The SMV and portal vein lack valves, so thrombosis can propagate bidirectionally. Primary MVT occurs in hypercoagulable states, while secondary MVT occurs from local causes (inflammation, malignancy, cirrhosis). The hemorrhagic nature of venous infarction is due to continued arterial inflow into obstructed venous drainage."
