    "statement": {
      "text": "Managing mesenteric ischemia in elderly patients with multiple comorbidities requires careful consideration of baseline functional status, physiologic reserve, patient wishes, and realistic expected outcomes, often necessitating difficult conversations about goals of care and the appropriateness of aggressive surgical intervention.",

    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Mesenteric ischemia disproportionately affects the elderly - the same patients with the least physiologic reserve to survive major surgery. A technically successful revascularization means little if the 90-year-old with dementia and heart failure never recovers enough to leave the ICU. We must ask: even if we can operate, should we?",
      "key_insight": "The decision to operate on an elderly, comorbid patient with mesenteric ischemia is fundamentally a values-based decision that belongs to the patient (or their surrogate). Our role is to provide honest prognostic information, facilitate understanding of realistic outcomes, and support whatever decision aligns with the patient's values and wishes.",
      "technical_details": "Studies consistently show that age >70, dementia, poor functional status (dependent ADLs), and multiple comorbidities (CAD, CKD, COPD, CHF) are associated with dramatically increased perioperative mortality and worse long-term outcomes. Frailty indices and functional assessments may help quantify surgical risk."
