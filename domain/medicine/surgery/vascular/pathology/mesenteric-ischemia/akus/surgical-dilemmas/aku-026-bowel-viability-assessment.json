    "statement": {
      "text": "Intraoperative bowel viability assessment remains one of the most challenging aspects of mesenteric ischemia surgery, requiring integration of clinical signs (color, peristalsis, bleeding), adjunctive technologies (fluorescein, Doppler), and surgical judgment to distinguish reversibly ischemic from irreversibly necrotic bowel, with second-look laparotomy serving as a critical safety net.",
      "formal": "Viability Assessment: Visual inspection + Palpation + Doppler signals + Adjuncts (fluorescein/ICG) + Time for reperfusion → Viable (observe) OR Nonviable (resect) OR Indeterminate (second-look)"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Assessing bowel viability is like trying to determine if a wilted plant is salvageable or dead. A plant that's drooping from lack of water might recover once watered, but one whose roots have rotted will not. Similarly, bowel that looks dark from temporary blood deprivation may pink up after revascularization, while truly necrotic bowel is dead regardless of blood flow restoration.",
      "key_insight": "No single test can definitively distinguish ischemic from necrotic bowel at the time of surgery. Even the best clinical judgment has a 10-20% error rate. This uncertainty is why the second-look laparotomy was developed - a planned return in 24-48 hours to reassess questionable segments after giving reperfusion time to declare whether bowel will survive.",
      "technical_details": "The bowel's survival depends on the depth and duration of ischemia. Mucosal ischemia may recover completely, while transmural necrosis will not. The challenge is that transmural necrosis may not be apparent at the time of initial surgery, especially in the setting of reperfusion. Waiting 15-30 minutes after revascularization before making final resection decisions is standard practice."
