    "statement": {
      "text": "Damage control surgery in mesenteric ischemia involves abbreviated initial operation focused on restoring intestinal blood flow and removing obvious necrosis, followed by temporary abdominal closure and ICU resuscitation, with planned return to the operating room for definitive bowel assessment, anastomosis, and closure once physiologic parameters have normalized.",
      "formal": "Damage Control: Revascularize → Resect obvious necrosis → Leave bowel in discontinuity → Temporary closure → ICU resuscitation → Planned re-exploration (24-48h) → Definitive surgery"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Damage control surgery is like emergency triage at a disaster site: address the immediate life threats, stabilize the patient, and defer non-urgent decisions. In AMI, this means restoring blood flow and removing dead bowel, but NOT creating anastomoses or making final closure decisions until the patient's physiology has recovered.",
      "key_insight": "The 'lethal triad' of hypothermia, coagulopathy, and acidosis kills patients. A beautifully constructed anastomosis is worthless if the patient dies of ongoing shock in the ICU. Damage control surgery prioritizes physiologic restoration over anatomic restoration, recognizing that the patient must survive the night before benefiting from definitive reconstruction.",
      "technical_details": "Damage control involves: (1) abbreviated operation (<90 min), (2) control of contamination and bleeding, (3) leaving bowel in discontinuity (stapled ends), (4) temporary abdominal closure (VAC, Bogota bag), (5) ICU resuscitation to normalize pH, temperature, and coagulation, (6) planned return in 24-48 hours for definitive management."
