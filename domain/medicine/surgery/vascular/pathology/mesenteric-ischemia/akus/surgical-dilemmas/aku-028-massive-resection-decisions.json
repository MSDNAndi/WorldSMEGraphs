    "statement": {
      "text": "The discovery of massive bowel necrosis during surgery for mesenteric ischemia confronts the surgeon with one of the most difficult dilemmas in surgery: whether to proceed with extensive resection knowing it may result in short bowel syndrome and TPN-dependence, or to recognize futility and provide compassionate end-of-life care, balancing patient wishes, quality of life considerations, and medical reality.",
      "formal": "Massive Necrosis Decision: Extent of viable bowel + Patient factors (age, comorbidity, wishes) + Available resources → Extensive resection OR Palliative closure OR Family conference for goals of care"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Imagine opening a patient's abdomen expecting to save their life, only to find that nearly all of their intestine is dead. You face an impossible choice: resect everything and condemn them to a life dependent on intravenous nutrition (if they even survive), or close without resection and let them die. This is the moment where surgical skill becomes less important than wisdom, ethics, and communication.",
      "key_insight": "There is no 'correct' answer to this dilemma. The surgeon must rapidly integrate anatomic findings, patient factors, and available resources while managing their own emotions and the expectations of the family. Having pre-established mental frameworks and honest discussions about goals of care are essential.",
      "technical_details": "Short bowel syndrome (SBS) generally results from <200 cm of remaining small bowel (or <100 cm without colon). Survival with SBS depends on remaining bowel length, presence of ileocecal valve, colonic continuity, and access to specialized intestinal rehabilitation. TPN-dependent SBS has significant morbidity and 5-year survival of 70-80% in specialized centers."
