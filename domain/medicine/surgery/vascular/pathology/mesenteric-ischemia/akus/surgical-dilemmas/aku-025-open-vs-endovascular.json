    "statement": {
      "text": "The choice between open and endovascular revascularization for mesenteric ischemia represents one of the most consequential surgical dilemmas, balancing immediate bowel assessment capability and long-term patency (open) against reduced invasiveness and faster revascularization (endovascular), with the decision hinging on bowel viability certainty and patient physiology.",
      "formal": "Decision Framework: Patient stability + Bowel viability status + Anatomic suitability + Surgeon/team expertise → Open OR Endovascular OR Hybrid approach"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "This dilemma is like choosing between two fire-fighting approaches: one requires breaking down the door to directly fight the fire and rescue victims (open surgery), while the other tries to extinguish flames through the keyhole but cannot confirm everyone is safe inside (endovascular). The right choice depends on how confident you are that the house occupants are still alive.",
      "key_insight": "The crux of the dilemma is not revascularization technique - both can restore blood flow effectively. The issue is whether you need to see the bowel. If peritonitis is present or bowel necrosis is likely, you must have eyes on the bowel. If the bowel is almost certainly viable, endovascular offers faster, less invasive revascularization.",
      "technical_details": "Evidence is evolving: earlier data favored open surgery in AMI, but recent series show equivalent or improved outcomes with endovascular-first approach in carefully selected patients. The hybrid approach (endovascular revascularization followed by laparoscopy or laparotomy) attempts to combine advantages of both."
