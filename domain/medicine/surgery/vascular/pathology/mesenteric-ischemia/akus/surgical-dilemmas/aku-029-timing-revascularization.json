    "statement": {
      "text": "The timing of revascularization in acute mesenteric ischemia is a race against the ischemic clock, with studies showing dramatically improved survival when intervention occurs within 6-12 hours of symptom onset, creating tension between the need for adequate resuscitation and the imperative for rapid blood flow restoration.",
      "formal": "Timing Dilemma: Earlier revascularization → Better bowel survival → BUT → Need adequate resuscitation → Must minimize delays"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Think of acute mesenteric ischemia like an acute stroke or heart attack - every minute counts. But unlike the brain or heart, which can tolerate only minutes of ischemia, the intestine has about 6-12 hours before irreversible transmural necrosis develops. This larger window allows for some resuscitation, but delays beyond this are devastating.",
      "key_insight": "The fundamental tension is between the need to stabilize the patient (fluids, correct acidosis, optimize hemodynamics) and the imperative to restore blood flow before the bowel dies. The answer is to do both simultaneously - resuscitate EN ROUTE to the operating room, not BEFORE going."
