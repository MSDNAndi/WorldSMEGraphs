    "title": "Decision Fatigue and Ego Depletion: Cognitive Resource Theory",
    "summary": "The psychological phenomenon of deteriorating decision quality after prolonged decision-making, including mechanisms, evidence, and prevention strategies",
    "key_points": [
      "Decision fatigue is the deterioration of decision quality after prolonged decision-making",
      "Ego depletion model: self-control draws from a limited cognitive resource",
      "Depleted willpower leads to decision avoidance, impulsivity, or poor choices",

    ],
    "statement": {
      "text": "Decision fatigue occurs when the act of making decisions depletes a finite cognitive resource associated with the prefrontal cortex, leading to impaired judgment, increased impulsivity, or decision avoidance. The ego depletion model proposes that self-control and effortful decision-making draw from a common, limited pool of mental resources.",
      "formal": "Decision Quality = f(Initial Capacity - Cumulative Decisions - Time); Quality ↓ as Decision Count ↑"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Think of your decision-making ability like a smartphone battery. Every decision - even small ones - drains a bit of charge. By late afternoon, after hundreds of decisions, you're running on low power mode, making you more likely to choose the default option, avoid decisions entirely, or make impulsive choices.",
      "key_insight": "The brain doesn't distinguish between important and trivial decisions when depleting willpower reserves. Choosing breakfast, picking what to wear, and whether to make a phone call ALL draw from the same limited pool. Smart decision-makers pre-decide trivial matters to save capacity for what matters."
