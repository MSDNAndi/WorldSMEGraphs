    "summary": "The psychology of FOMO - apprehensive anxiety about missing rewarding experiences, its relationship to social comparison and social media, and management strategies",
    "key_points": [
      "FOMO is apprehensive anxiety that others are having rewarding experiences without you",
      "Rooted in social comparison theory and need for social belonging",
      "Correlates with lower mood, life satisfaction, and increased social media use",
      "Social media amplifies FOMO through curated 'highlight reel' content",
      "JOMO (Joy of Missing Out) is the intentional practice of accepting and enjoying chosen limits",
      "Paradox: chasing everything leads to enjoying nothing (decision overload, exhaustion)",

    ],
    "statement": {
      "text": "Fear of Missing Out (FOMO) is a pervasive apprehension that others are having rewarding experiences from which one is absent. It is driven by social comparison processes, need for belonging, and amplified by social media's presentation of curated positive experiences. FOMO is associated with lower wellbeing and problematic technology use.",

    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "FOMO is the nagging voice asking 'What if I'm missing something important right now?' This voice, amplified by seeing others' social media posts showing their highlights, can prevent you from fully engaging with whatever you ARE doing. It's social comparison on steroids.",
      "key_insight": "The cure for FOMO isn't attending everything (impossible) - it's making peace with intentional choices. When you clearly define your priorities and accept that tradeoffs are inevitable, you can fully engage with chosen activities instead of being distracted by unchosen ones. JOMO is the recognition that missing things is a feature, not a bug."
