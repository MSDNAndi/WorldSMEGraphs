    "definition": "The Phillips curve describes the empirical inverse relationship between unemployment and inflation (or wage growth). Originally discovered by A.W. Phillips (1958) for UK wages, it was interpreted as a stable policy tradeoff: lower unemployment could be achieved at the cost of higher inflation. The expectations-augmented Phillips curve (Friedman-Phelps) modified this: π = πᵉ - β(u - uⁿ), showing that the tradeoff only exists when actual inflation differs from expected inflation. In the long run, when expectations adjust, there is no tradeoff - the long-run Phillips curve is vertical at the natural rate of unemployment (NAIRU).",

    "statement": "The Phillips curve represents one of the most important relationships in macroeconomics, describing the short-run tradeoff between unemployment and inflation. Understanding how expectations modify this relationship - creating only a temporary tradeoff that disappears in the long run - is essential for analyzing monetary policy, disinflation strategies, and macroeconomic stabilization.",
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Think of the Phillips curve as describing labor market pressure on prices. When unemployment is low, workers are scarce. Businesses must offer higher wages to attract and retain employees. These higher labor costs get passed on as higher prices - inflation. When unemployment is high, workers are abundant. They accept lower wages, cost pressures ease, inflation falls. BUT there's a catch: if workers expect 3% inflation, they demand 3% wage increases just to stay even. Only if actual inflation SURPRISES them (differs from expectations) does the tradeoff work. That's why you can't keep pushing unemployment below natural rate - eventually everyone expects the higher inflation, demands higher wages, and unemployment returns to its natural rate, but now with permanently higher inflation.",
      "key_insight": "The key insight is the distinction between short-run and long-run. In the short run (given fixed expectations), policymakers face a tradeoff: stimulate economy → lower u → higher π. But this tradeoff is temporary. As people adjust expectations upward, the short-run curve shifts up. To maintain low unemployment, you need ever-increasing inflation (accelerationist hypothesis). In the long run, the only stable point is where actual inflation equals expected inflation - at the natural rate of unemployment. This is why most economists believe: (1) Monetary policy can't permanently reduce unemployment below the natural rate, (2) Disinflation requires temporary recession (moving up the curve), (3) Credibility matters - if expectations adjust quickly, disinflation is less costly.",
      "technical_details": "Expectations-augmented Phillips curve: π = πᵉ - β(u - uⁿ) + ε. Variables: π = inflation, πᵉ = expected inflation, u = unemployment, uⁿ = natural rate (NAIRU), ε = supply shock. Coefficient β measures responsiveness (~0.5 historically). Alternative form (output gap): π = πᵉ + γ(Y - Y*)/Y* + ε. With adaptive expectations: πᵉ = π₋₁, so π - π₋₁ = -β(u - uⁿ) + ε (change in inflation depends on u gap). Long-run: Set π = πᵉ (expectations correct). Then 0 = -β(u - uⁿ) + ε, implying u = uⁿ + ε/β. Without shocks (ε=0): u = uⁿ at any stable inflation rate. NAIRU estimation: Where inflation stable (Δπ = 0). Sacrifice ratio = Σ(u - uⁿ) / Δπ - cumulative unemployment cost per point of disinflation.",
