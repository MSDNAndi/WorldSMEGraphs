      "deflation": "A sustained decrease in the general price level, the opposite of inflation",

    "key_points": [
      "Inflation erodes the purchasing power of money over time, meaning each unit of currency buys fewer goods and services",
      "Measured primarily by Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Producer Price Index (PPI)",
      "Moderate inflation (2-3% annually) is considered healthy for economic growth; very high or very low inflation creates problems",
      "Three main causes: demand-pull (excess demand), cost-push (rising input costs), and built-in (wage-price spiral)",
      "Central banks use monetary policy (interest rates, money supply) to target specific inflation rates",
      "Inflation redistributes wealth from lenders to borrowers and from those with fixed incomes to those with flexible incomes",
      "Anticipated inflation can be planned for; unexpected inflation creates economic uncertainty and inefficiency"

      }
    ],
    "statement": "Inflation is a sustained increase in the general price level of goods and services in an economy over time, reducing the purchasing power of money and affecting economic decisions of consumers, businesses, and policymakers.",
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Inflation means 'your money doesn't go as far as it used to.' If inflation is 3%, something that cost $100 last year costs $103 this year. Over time, this compounds - $100 in 2000 had the purchasing power of about $180 in 2024. Inflation isn't necessarily bad; moderate inflation encourages spending and investment rather than hoarding cash. But high inflation creates problems, and deflation (falling prices) can be even worse, as it encourages people to delay purchases.",
      "key_insight": "Inflation is fundamentally about the relationship between money supply and goods/services available. Too much money chasing too few goods drives prices up (demand-pull). Rising production costs force businesses to raise prices (cost-push). And inflation expectations become self-fulfilling: if workers expect 5% inflation, they demand 5% raises, businesses raise prices 5% to cover costs, validating the original expectation (wage-price spiral).",
      "technical_details": "Inflation rate = [(CPI_current - CPI_previous) / CPI_previous] \u00d7 100%. Fisher equation links nominal interest rate, real interest rate, and inflation: i = r + \u03c0, where i = nominal rate, r = real rate, \u03c0 = inflation rate. Central banks target inflation rates (typically 2% in developed economies) using Taylor Rule: i_t = r* + \u03c0_t + 0.5(\u03c0_t - \u03c0*) + 0.5(y_t - y*), where r* = equilibrium real rate, \u03c0* = target inflation, y = output gap.",
