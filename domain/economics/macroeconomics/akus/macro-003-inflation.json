    "statement": "Inflation is a sustained increase in the general price level of goods and services in an economy over time, reducing the purchasing power of money and affecting economic decisions of consumers, businesses, and policymakers.",
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Inflation means 'your money doesn't go as far as it used to.' If inflation is 3%, something that cost $100 last year costs $103 this year. Over time, this compounds - $100 in 2000 had the purchasing power of about $180 in 2024. Inflation isn't necessarily bad; moderate inflation encourages spending and investment rather than hoarding cash. But high inflation creates problems, and deflation (falling prices) can be even worse, as it encourages people to delay purchases.",
      "key_insight": "Inflation is fundamentally about the relationship between money supply and goods/services available. Too much money chasing too few goods drives prices up (demand-pull). Rising production costs force businesses to raise prices (cost-push). And inflation expectations become self-fulfilling: if workers expect 5% inflation, they demand 5% raises, businesses raise prices 5% to cover costs, validating the original expectation (wage-price spiral).",
      "technical_details": "Inflation rate = [(CPI_current - CPI_previous) / CPI_previous] \u00d7 100%. Fisher equation links nominal interest rate, real interest rate, and inflation: i = r + \u03c0, where i = nominal rate, r = real rate, \u03c0 = inflation rate. Central banks target inflation rates (typically 2% in developed economies) using Taylor Rule: i_t = r* + \u03c0_t + 0.5(\u03c0_t - \u03c0*) + 0.5(y_t - y*), where r* = equilibrium real rate, \u03c0* = target inflation, y = output gap. Phillips Curve demonstrates short-run tradeoff: \u03c0_t = \u03c0_t^e - \u03b2(u_t - u_n) + \u03b5_t, where \u03c0_t^e = expected inflation, u_t = unemployment rate, u_n = natural rate, \u03b2 = sensitivity parameter, \u03b5_t = supply shock. Modern expectations-augmented Phillips Curve incorporates adaptive or rational expectations. Inflation persistence measured by autoregressive coefficient in \u03c0_t = \u03b1 + \u03c1\u03c0_{t-1} + \u03b5_t; high \u03c1 indicates inflation inertia requiring stronger policy response.",

      "historical_context": "Inflation has varied dramatically across time and countries. Post-WWII Bretton Woods era (1944-1971) saw relatively stable prices due to gold standard discipline. 1970s Great Inflation saw US inflation peak at 13.5% (1980), driven by oil shocks and loose monetary policy. Volcker disinflation (1979-1982) brought inflation down through aggressive interest rate increases (Federal Funds rate reached 20%), but caused severe recession with unemployment over 10%. Post-1990 'Great Moderation' featured low, stable inflation (~2%) in developed economies through credible inflation targeting. 2008 financial crisis raised deflation fears, leading to unconventional monetary policy (QE, negative rates). Post-pandemic inflation (2021-2023) reached 40-year highs in many countries, testing modern central bank frameworks.",
      "empirical_evidence": "Cross-country studies show strong correlation between money supply growth and inflation over long periods (r≈0.95 for M2 growth vs inflation over 20+ years). However, short-run relationship is weaker due to velocity changes and real output growth. Phillips Curve relationship has flattened in recent decades (slope coefficient declined from ~0.5 in 1960s to ~0.1 in 2010s), suggesting inflation less responsive to unemployment. Inflation expectations have become better anchored in inflation-targeting regimes: survey measures show expected inflation closer to targets with less volatility. Natural rate of unemployment (NAIRU) estimates vary: US estimates range 4-5.5% depending on methodology and time period."
