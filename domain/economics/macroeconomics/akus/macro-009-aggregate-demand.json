    "definition": "Aggregate demand (AD) represents the total quantity of goods and services that all economic agents (households, firms, government, foreigners) are willing and able to purchase at each price level during a given time period. It is the sum of consumption (C), investment (I), government spending (G), and net exports (X - M): AD = C + I + G + (X - M). The AD curve slopes downward because higher price levels reduce real wealth (wealth effect), increase interest rates (interest rate effect), and make domestic goods more expensive relative to foreign goods (exchange rate effect).",
    "definitions_glossary": {
      "aggregate_demand": "Total spending on domestically produced goods and services at each price level: AD = C + I + G + NX",

Classical theory predicted wage/price falls would restore equilibrium. Keynes argued: falling wages reduce income → reduce consumption → further AD decline (paradox of thrift).

AD growth of 10%+ annually for decades. Concerns: excessive reliance on I, low C share (only 35% of GDP vs 68% in US).

    "statement": "Aggregate demand represents total spending in the economy at each price level, composed of consumption, investment, government purchases, and net exports. Understanding AD and its determinants is essential for analyzing business cycles, the effects of fiscal and monetary policy, and the causes of recessions and inflations.",
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Think of aggregate demand as the total dollar amount everyone in the economy wants to spend on stuff. Households buy groceries, cars, and houses (C). Businesses buy machines, build factories, and stock inventory (I). Government buys roads, schools, and military equipment (G). Foreigners buy our exports while we buy their imports (NX). Add it all up: that's AD. When the price level rises, people don't want to spend as much: their cash buys less (wealth effect), borrowing gets expensive (interest rate effect), and foreign goods look cheaper (exchange rate effect). So AD slopes downward. When people get optimistic, taxes fall, or the Fed cuts rates, everyone wants to spend more at every price level - the whole AD curve shifts right.",
      "key_insight": "The revolutionary insight is that AD determines output and employment in the short run - not just prices. In classical economics, prices adjust instantly so AD only affects the price level, not real output. Keynes showed that with sticky prices and wages, AD shortfalls cause recessions with involuntary unemployment. This is why recessions aren't just bad luck - they're demand failures that policy can address. Understanding AD components reveals policy levers: Cut taxes or increase G → AD shifts right. Fed cuts rates → I and C rise → AD shifts right. This is why governments and central banks actively manage AD to stabilize business cycles.",
      "technical_details": "AD function: Y^d = C(Y-T, r, wealth) + I(r, expectations) + G + NX(e, Y, Y*). Consumption: C = C₀ + MPC(Y-T) - br where C₀ is autonomous consumption, MPC is marginal propensity to consume, b is interest sensitivity. Investment: I = I₀ - hr where I₀ is autonomous investment, h is interest sensitivity. Net exports: NX = NX₀ - mY + m*Y* - θe where m is marginal propensity to import, e is exchange rate. AD curve derived from IS-LM: IS gives r(Y), substitute into AD components. Result: Y = f(P) where ∂Y/∂P < 0.
