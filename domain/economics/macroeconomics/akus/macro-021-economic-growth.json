    "statement": "Economic growth—sustained increases in real GDP or real GDP per capita over time—is the primary driver of long-run improvements in material living standards. However, growth does not automatically translate into broad-based development; institutional quality, distributional equity, environmental sustainability, and employment patterns critically mediate whether growth improves human welfare.",
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Imagine a village that produces 100 loaves of bread per year. If it increases production to 110 loaves next year, that's 10% growth. If sustained over decades (compounding at even modest rates like 2-3% annually), the village transforms from subsistence to prosperity. Economic growth is the compounding of productive capacity over time—it's why we live vastly better than our great-grandparents despite being no more talented or hardworking.",
      "key_insight": "The power of compounding transforms economies: at 7% annual growth, income doubles every 10 years (Rule of 70). This explains China's rise (9.5%/year for 40 years → 35-fold increase) and why even modest 1.5-2% annual growth (typical of developed economies) makes each generation substantially richer than the last. However, growth's benefits depend crucially on institutional quality (corrupt regimes squander resource wealth), structural composition (manufacturing creates more jobs than capital-intensive extraction), and distribution (growth that only enriches elites leaves the majority behind). Growth is necessary but not sufficient for development.",
      "technical_details": "Growth accounting decomposes output growth (ΔY/Y) into contributions from capital (ΔK/K), labor (ΔL/L), and Total Factor Productivity (ΔA/A): ΔY/Y = α(ΔK/K) + (1-α)(ΔL/L) + ΔA/A, where α is capital's share (~0.33). TFP captures technological change and efficiency gains—the 'Solow residual.' Sustained growth requires TFP improvements; input accumulation alone faces diminishing returns (doubling capital doesn't double output). Endogenous growth models (Romer 1990) emphasize innovation: ideas are non-rivalrous and exhibit increasing returns, enabling perpetual growth. Empirically, cross-country regressions show institutions (rule of law, property rights), human capital (education), and openness (trade, FDI) strongly predict growth. The Solow model predicts conditional convergence: poor countries grow faster (catch-up effect) IF they have good institutions; unconditional convergence failed (Africa didn't catch up). Development accounting attributes cross-country income differences: ~50% from TFP, ~30% from physical capital, ~20% from human capital (Caselli 2005)."
