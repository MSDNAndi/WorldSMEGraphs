    "statement": "Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is the total monetary or market value of all finished goods and services produced within a country's borders in a specific time period, serving as the primary indicator of economic size and health.",
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "GDP measures the size and health of an economy by summing the value of everything produced domestically. Think of it as the economy's report card - a single number capturing all economic activity, from haircuts to automobiles to government services. Higher GDP generally indicates a larger, more productive economy.",
      "key_insight": "GDP can be calculated three equivalent ways due to the circular flow of income: (1) Expenditure approach - sum all spending on final goods/services (C+I+G+NX), (2) Income approach - sum all incomes earned (wages+profits+rent+interest), (3) Production approach - sum value added at each production stage. All three methods should yield identical results because one person's spending is another's income.",
      "technical_details": "GDP expenditure identity: GDP = C + I + G + (X - M), where C = personal consumption expenditures (typically 60-70% of GDP), I = gross private domestic investment (includes business investment, residential construction, and inventory changes), G = government consumption and investment (federal, state, local), X = exports, M = imports. The difference (X-M) is net exports or trade balance. GDP deflator = (Nominal GDP / Real GDP) \u00d7 100 converts between nominal and real GDP.",

        "expenditure_approach": "GDP = C + I + G + (X - M)",
        "income_approach": "GDP = W + R + i + \u03c0 + IBT + CCA + NFS, where W=wages, R=rent, i=interest, \u03c0=profits, IBT=indirect business taxes, CCA=capital consumption allowance (depreciation), NFS=net foreign income",
        "production_approach": "GDP = \u03a3(Value of output - Value of intermediate consumption) across all industries",
