      "intuition": "GDP measures the size and health of an economy by summing the value of everything produced domestically. Think of it as the economy's report card - a single number capturing all economic activity, from haircuts to automobiles to government services. Higher GDP generally indicates a larger, more productive economy.",

All three methods should yield identical results because one person's spending is another's income.",
      "technical_details": "GDP expenditure identity: GDP = C + I + G + (X - M), where C = personal consumption expenditures (typically 60-70% of GDP), I = gross private domestic investment (includes business investment, residential construction, and inventory changes), G = government consumption and investment (federal, state, local), X = exports, M = imports. The difference (X-M) is net exports or trade balance. GDP deflator = (Nominal GDP / Real GDP) \u00d7 100 converts between nominal and real GDP.",
