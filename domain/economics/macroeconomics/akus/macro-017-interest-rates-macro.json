    "definition": "Interest rates are the price of borrowing money, expressed as a percentage of the principal per time period. In macroeconomics, interest rates serve as the primary transmission mechanism of monetary policy, linking central bank actions to aggregate demand. The central bank sets a short-term policy rate (e.g., federal funds rate in US) which influences all other interest rates in the economy - from Treasury yields to mortgage rates to corporate borrowing costs. Interest rates affect investment (higher rates reduce investment), consumption (especially durables and housing), exchange rates, and asset prices, making them the most important single variable for macroeconomic management.",

    "statement": "Interest rates serve as the primary transmission mechanism of monetary policy and are the single most important price in the macroeconomy. Understanding how central banks set rates, how rates transmit through the economy, and how they affect investment, consumption, and exchange rates is essential for macroeconomic analysis and policy.",
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Interest rates are like a thermostat for the economy. When the economy is 'overheating' (too much demand, rising inflation), the central bank raises rates to cool things down. Higher rates make borrowing more expensive, so businesses invest less, consumers buy fewer cars and houses, and spending slows. When the economy is too cold (recession, high unemployment), the central bank cuts rates to warm things up. Lower rates make borrowing cheaper, stimulating investment and consumption. The challenge is finding the 'just right' rate - not too hot (inflation), not too cold (recession). The neutral rate (r*) is this goldilocks level.",
      "key_insight": "The crucial insight is that real interest rates - not nominal rates - determine economic behavior. If nominal rate is 5% but inflation is 3%, the real borrowing cost is only 2%. This is the Fisher equation: i = r + πᵉ. In 2022-23, even though nominal rates rose to 5.5%, with inflation at 3-5%, real rates were only 0.5-2.5% - still low by historical standards. This explains why the economy remained strong despite rate hikes. Conversely, in 2020 with 0% nominal rates and 1.5% inflation, real rates were -1.5% - negative real rates meant you were effectively being paid to borrow.",
      "technical_details": "Rate setting: FOMC meets 8 times/year, sets federal funds rate target range. Implementation: Open market operations adjust reserve supply to achieve target. Overnight reverse repo (ON RRP) and interest on reserves (IOR) create floor and ceiling. Transmission mechanism: Fed funds → short-term Treasury yields (expectations + term premium) → long-term Treasuries → risk-free curve → add credit spreads → corporate bonds, mortgages, loans. Time lags: Changes in fed funds affect real economy with 'long and variable lags' (Friedman) - typically 6-18 months.
