    "definition": "A recession is a significant decline in economic activity spread across the economy, lasting more than a few months, normally visible in real GDP, real income, employment, industrial production, and wholesale-retail sales. The NBER Business Cycle Dating Committee officially dates US recessions based on comprehensive analysis rather than a rigid formula. The popular 'two consecutive quarters of negative GDP growth' is a rough approximation, not the official definition. Recessions represent the contraction phase of the business cycle, typically characterized by rising unemployment, falling output, declining investment, and reduced consumer spending.",

    "statement": "A recession represents a significant, broad-based decline in economic activity that causes substantial hardship through rising unemployment, falling incomes, and reduced economic opportunity. Understanding recession causes, characteristics, policy responses, and long-term effects is essential for macroeconomic analysis and policymaking.",
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "A recession is like the economy catching a cold - or sometimes the flu. Economic activity slows down: businesses sell less, so they produce less, so they employ fewer workers, who then have less income to spend, causing businesses to sell even less. This negative feedback loop is why recessions can be self-reinforcing. The severity depends on what caused the recession (financial crisis = more severe), how quickly policy responds (faster = shorter recession), and structural factors (debt levels, labor market flexibility). Recovery happens when something breaks the cycle: policy stimulus boosts demand, confidence returns, or pent-up spending is finally released.",
      "key_insight": "The crucial insight is that recessions are not just inevitable dips but periods that can cause permanent damage (hysteresis/scarring). Long-term unemployment erodes skills and reduces future employability. Firms that fail don't come back. Workers who lose jobs in recessions have lower lifetime earnings. Investment foregone means less future productive capacity. This is why policy intervention matters: shorter, shallower recessions minimize permanent damage. The debate is how much intervention is appropriate (risk of over-intervention: inflation, debt), not whether to respond at all. The Great Recession taught that insufficient response prolongs suffering; COVID taught that aggressive response enables rapid recovery.",
      "technical_details": "NBER Dating Committee examines: (1) Real personal income less transfers, (2) Nonfarm payroll employment, (3) Real personal consumption expenditures, (4) Wholesale-retail sales, (5) Industrial production, (6) Household survey employment. Recession declared when majority show significant decline for several months. Peak dated when activity reaches highest point, trough when it reaches lowest. Output gap = (Y - Y*)/Y* where Y* is potential GDP. Okun's Law: 1pp unemployment above natural rate ≈ 2% negative output gap. Automatic stabilizers: Tax revenue falls (less income to tax) + transfer spending rises (unemployment benefits) ≈ ~1-2% GDP fiscal impulse automatically. Discretionary fiscal multiplier: 0.5-2.0 depending on economic conditions (higher at ZLB).",
