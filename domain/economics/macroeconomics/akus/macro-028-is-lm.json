    "title": "IS-LM Model",
    "definition": "The IS-LM model is a macroeconomic framework developed by John Hicks (1937) to interpret Keynes's General Theory. It shows how the goods market (IS curve) and money market (LM curve) simultaneously determine equilibrium output (Y) and interest rate (r). The IS curve represents goods market equilibrium where investment equals saving; it slopes downward because lower interest rates stimulate investment and output. The LM curve represents money market equilibrium where money demand equals money supply; it slopes upward because higher income increases money demand, requiring higher interest rates for equilibrium. The intersection determines the economy's short-run equilibrium.",

    "statement": "The IS-LM model is the workhorse of short-run macroeconomic analysis, showing how goods and money markets jointly determine output and interest rates. It provides the theoretical foundation for understanding how fiscal and monetary policy affect the economy, including the phenomenon of crowding out and the special cases of liquidity trap and classical dichotomy.",
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Think of IS-LM as two markets talking to each other. The goods market says: 'If interest rates are low, businesses invest more, so we need more output.' The money market says: 'If output is high, people need more money for transactions, so interest rates must be high.' The IS curve captures the first relationship (low r → high Y). The LM curve captures the second (high Y → high r). Where they cross, both markets are satisfied - that's equilibrium. Fiscal policy (changing G or T) affects the goods market directly, shifting IS. Monetary policy (changing M) affects the money market directly, shifting LM. But because the markets are connected, each policy affects both Y and r.",
      "key_insight": "The crucial insight is crowding out - why fiscal policy is less powerful than the simple multiplier suggests. When government spends more, output and income rise, people want more money for transactions, so they sell bonds, bond prices fall, interest rates rise. Higher rates reduce private investment. So government spending 'crowds out' some private investment. The amount of crowding out depends on LM slope: flat LM (liquidity trap) → no crowding out → full multiplier. Steep LM (classical case) → complete crowding out → fiscal policy ineffective. This is why the effectiveness of fiscal policy depends on monetary conditions and the state of the economy.",
      "technical_details": "IS curve derivation: Start with Y = C + I + G. Let C = C₀ + c(Y-T), I = I₀ - dr. Substitute: Y = C₀ + c(Y-T) + I₀ - dr + G. Solve: Y(1-c) = C₀ - cT + I₀ - dr + G. So Y = [1/(1-c)][A - dr] where A = C₀ - cT + I₀ + G. This is IS: Y = f(r) with f'(r) < 0 (downward sloping). LM curve derivation: M/P = kY - hr (money demand). Solve for r: r = (kY - M/P)/h = (k/h)Y - (1/h)(M/P). This is LM: r = g(Y) with g'(Y) > 0 (upward sloping). Equilibrium: Solve IS and LM simultaneously for Y* and r*.
