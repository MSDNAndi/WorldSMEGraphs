    "definition": "Aggregate supply (AS) represents the total quantity of goods and services that all firms in an economy are willing and able to produce at each price level during a given time period. The aggregate supply curve shows the relationship between the overall price level and total real GDP produced, distinguishing between short-run aggregate supply (SRAS) which is upward-sloping due to sticky wages and prices, and long-run aggregate supply (LRAS) which is vertical at potential output where all prices have fully adjusted.",

    "statement": "Aggregate supply represents the total output that all firms in an economy are willing to produce at each price level. Understanding the distinction between short-run (upward-sloping) and long-run (vertical) aggregate supply is essential for analyzing macroeconomic fluctuations, supply shocks, inflation, and the effectiveness of stabilization policies.",
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Think of aggregate supply as the economy's production capacity and willingness to produce. In the short run, when overall prices rise but wages and other costs haven't caught up yet, firms find it profitable to produce more - their revenues rise faster than costs. This is why SRAS slopes upward. But in the long run, workers demand higher wages and all costs adjust to the higher price level, eliminating the extra profit. So long-run output depends only on real capacity - how many workers, machines, and how good the technology - not on the price level. The economy's potential output is like a speed limit: you can temporarily exceed it (overheating) or fall short (recession), but you always tend back toward it.",
      "key_insight": "The crucial distinction between SRAS and LRAS explains why monetary/fiscal policy can boost output in the short run but only causes inflation in the long run. When the Fed injects money, AD shifts right. Short-run: output rises as firms respond to higher prices before costs catch up. Long-run: all prices (including wages) rise proportionally, real output returns to potential, and only the price level is permanently higher. This is the classical dichotomy - money is neutral in the long run. Supply shocks are different: they shift SRAS and cause the painful combination of higher prices AND lower output (stagflation), which demand-side policy cannot easily fix.",
      "technical_details": "SRAS curve: Y = Y* + α(P - Pᵉ) where Y* is potential output, P is actual price level, Pᵉ is expected price level, and α > 0 measures price surprise responsiveness. Alternatively: P = Pᵉ + (1/α)(Y - Y*). When P > Pᵉ, firms produce above potential; when P < Pᵉ, below. LRAS: Y = Y* regardless of P - vertical line at potential output. Y* = A·F(K, L) where A is total factor productivity, K is capital stock, L is labor force. Shift factors for SRAS: expected price level Pᵉ (higher Pᵉ shifts SRAS up/left), input prices (oil, wages), productivity shocks, natural disasters. Shift factors for LRAS: technology (A), labor force (L), capital stock (K), institutions/efficiency. Short-run equilibrium: AD = SRAS. Long-run equilibrium: AD = SRAS = LRAS with P = Pᵉ.",
