    "definition": "A liquidity trap is a macroeconomic condition where interest rates are at or near zero (the zero lower bound), and conventional monetary policy becomes ineffective at stimulating aggregate demand. When rates cannot fall further, additional money creation simply results in cash hoarding rather than increased lending and spending - the economy absorbs liquidity without any stimulative effect. The LM curve becomes horizontal at the zero bound, making fiscal policy fully effective (no crowding out) while monetary policy is 'pushing on a string.' First theorized by Keynes and later developed by Hicks, liquidity traps became practically relevant during Japan's Lost Decades and the 2008 Global Financial Crisis.",

    "statement": "The liquidity trap represents a critical limit on conventional monetary policy where interest rates at the zero lower bound prevent further rate cuts from stimulating the economy. Understanding this concept is essential for analyzing unconventional monetary policies (QE, negative rates, forward guidance), the enhanced effectiveness of fiscal policy at the zero bound, and the challenges of deflation and prolonged economic stagnation.",
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Think of interest rates as the 'price' of money. Normally, the central bank lowers this price to encourage borrowing and spending - like a store putting items on sale. But what happens when the price is already at zero? You can't give things away for less than free. This is the liquidity trap: rates at the floor, no room to cut further. Even if the central bank creates more money, people and banks just sit on it - it's trapped as idle cash. It's like pushing on a rope: you can pull (raise rates), but you can't push (lower below zero). The economy needs spending, but the usual monetary lever is stuck. That's when fiscal policy - government directly spending - becomes the main tool, and unconventional monetary policies like QE try to work around the constraint.",
      "key_insight": "The crucial insight is that the liquidity trap fundamentally changes the effectiveness of different policies. In normal times, fiscal expansion raises interest rates (crowding out investment), so multipliers are smaller and monetary policy is the preferred tool. At the ZLB, crowding out disappears - rates can't rise because they're at the floor. Fiscal multipliers become large and monetary policy becomes ineffective (at least through the interest rate channel). This reversal explains why 2008-era debates focused on fiscal stimulus vs austerity. Countries that pursued fiscal expansion (US, China) recovered faster than those pursuing austerity (Eurozone). The ZLB also creates deflation risk: if prices start falling, real interest rates rise (r_real = r_nom - π), depressing demand further, causing more deflation - a downward spiral Japan struggled with for decades.",
      "technical_details": "In IS-LM: LM curve is M/P = kY - hr. At ZLB (r = 0): M/P = kY. Any increase in M just increases liquidity hoarding. LM becomes horizontal at r = 0. Monetary policy: Increasing M shifts LM right, but along horizontal section - no change in r or Y. Fiscal policy: IS shifts right, moves along horizontal LM - full increase in Y, no change in r, no crowding out. Multiplier = 1/(1-MPC), not reduced by monetary offset. New Keynesian at ZLB: Central bank can still use expectations channel - commit to keeping rates low even after recovery (forward guidance) to lower long rates. QE works through portfolio balance (push investors to riskier assets) and signaling (demonstrates commitment). Negative rates: Effective lower bound slightly below zero due to cash storage costs. At truly zero floor: Keynesian liquidity trap fully applies.",
