    "title": "Central Banking",
    "definition": "A central bank is a public institution that manages a country's currency, money supply, and interest rates. It serves as the banker to the government and commercial banks, conducts monetary policy to achieve macroeconomic objectives (typically price stability and maximum employment), acts as lender of last resort during financial crises, and often supervises the banking system. Major central banks include the Federal Reserve (US), European Central Bank (ECB), Bank of Japan (BOJ), Bank of England (BOE), and People's Bank of China (PBOC). Central bank independence from political control is considered essential for credible anti-inflationary policy.",

    "statement": "Central banking is the institutional foundation of modern monetary systems. Central banks control money supply and interest rates to pursue macroeconomic objectives (price stability, maximum employment), serve as lender of last resort during financial crises, and increasingly oversee financial stability. Understanding central bank functions, tools, independence, and limitations is essential for analyzing monetary policy and macroeconomic outcomes.",
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Think of the central bank as the economy's thermostat and emergency fire department combined. As thermostat: it adjusts interest rates to keep the economy at the right 'temperature' - not too hot (inflation) or too cold (recession). Raise rates to cool overheating, cut rates to warm up a cold economy. As fire department: when financial panic threatens (bank runs, market seizures), the central bank provides emergency liquidity - lending freely to stop the fire from spreading. The central bank's independence is like giving the thermostat to an expert rather than letting people who want it warmer or cooler today control it - the expert focuses on long-term stable temperature, not short-term comfort.",
      "key_insight": "The most important insight is that central bank effectiveness depends critically on credibility and expectations. If people believe the central bank will maintain 2% inflation, they set wages and prices accordingly, and 2% becomes self-fulfilling. If they doubt the commitment, expectations become unanchored and inflation spirals. This is why independence matters: politicians facing elections have incentive to stimulate before voting (inflation later), creating 'inflation bias.' An independent central bank focused on long-term price stability doesn't face this temptation. Credibility also explains 'whatever it takes' power: Draghi's words alone moved markets because investors believed the ECB would act. Credibility is the central bank's most valuable asset - once lost, very costly to rebuild (as Volcker demonstrated).",
      "technical_details": "Fed's operational framework: Target federal funds rate (overnight interbank lending). Open market operations: Buy Treasury bonds → pay with reserves → more reserves → lower fed funds rate. Sell bonds → drain reserves → higher rate. Post-2008 with ample reserves: Interest on reserves (IOR) creates floor for fed funds (why lend below what Fed pays?). Overnight reverse repo (ON RRP) creates subfloor for non-bank lenders. Fed controls rate through corridor/floor system, not reserve scarcity. Taylor Rule: r = r* + 0.5(π - π*) + 0.5(y - y*) where r* = equilibrium real rate (≈2%), π* = target inflation (2%), y = output gap. Example: If inflation = 4%, output gap = 2%: r = 2 + 0.5(4-2) + 0.5(2) = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4% nominal.
