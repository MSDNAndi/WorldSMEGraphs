    "title": "Fiscal Multiplier",
    "definition": "The fiscal multiplier measures the ratio of the change in real GDP to an initial change in government spending or taxation. It captures the total impact on the economy, including all subsequent rounds of spending as income generated by the initial stimulus is re-spent. The simple Keynesian spending multiplier is k = 1/(1-MPC) where MPC is the marginal propensity to consume. For example, if MPC = 0.8, the multiplier is 5, meaning $1 of government spending ultimately increases GDP by $5. Actual multipliers vary significantly based on economic conditions, monetary policy response, and degree of openness.",

    "statement": "The fiscal multiplier is a crucial concept for understanding the effectiveness of government fiscal policy in stimulating or contracting the economy. It determines how much total economic activity changes in response to changes in government spending or taxation, with important implications for recession response, deficit debates, and macroeconomic stabilization policy.",
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Think of the economy as a series of connected ponds. When the government drops $1 into the first pond (spending), it creates ripples. That $1 becomes someone's income - maybe a construction worker. The worker spends 80 cents of it on groceries (if MPC = 0.8), which becomes the grocer's income. The grocer spends 80% of that ($0.64), and so on. Each round of spending is smaller than the last (the ripples fade), but the total effect adds up to more than the initial $1. The multiplier tells you how much bigger the total ripple is than the initial splash. More leakages (saving, taxes, imports) mean smaller ripples and a smaller multiplier. In a recession with lots of idle workers and factories, the ripples spread further because each dollar of spending actually creates production rather than just bidding up prices.",
      "key_insight": "The multiplier explains why fiscal policy can be powerful - and why economists argue about how powerful. In the simple Keynesian model, the multiplier can be 5 or more. In reality, multiple factors reduce it: (1) Crowding out: government borrowing raises interest rates, reducing private investment; (2) Leakages: saving, taxes on new income, spending on imports; (3) Ricardian equivalence: if households expect future tax increases to pay for today's deficits, they save more now; (4) Supply constraints: if economy near capacity, stimulus causes inflation not output growth. BUT multipliers are larger in recessions (when these factors are weaker) and when monetary policy is accommodative or stuck at zero. This is why Keynesians advocate stimulus during downturns and fiscal restraint during booms.",
      "technical_details": "Derivation of spending multiplier: Start with Y = C + I + G. Consumption: C = C₀ + MPC×(Y-T). Substitute: Y = C₀ + MPC×(Y-T) + I + G. Rearrange: Y - MPC×Y = C₀ - MPC×T + I + G. Factor: Y(1-MPC) = C₀ - MPC×T + I + G. Solve: Y = [1/(1-MPC)] × [C₀ - MPC×T + I + G]. The term 1/(1-MPC) is the multiplier. Differentiate: dY/dG = 1/(1-MPC) = k. With taxes: dY/dT = -MPC/(1-MPC). With imports: Y = C + I + G + (X-M), M = M₀ + MPM×Y. New multiplier: k = 1/(1-MPC+MPM). If MPC = 0.8, MPM = 0.2: k = 1/(1-0.8+0.2) = 2.5 (vs 5 without imports).",
