        "description": "U.S. unemployment rose from 4.7% (2007) to 10.0% (October 2009), representing 15.4 million unemployed. Took 7 years to return to pre-recession levels. Average duration of unemployment exceeded 40 weeks.",

    "statement": "Unemployment represents individuals in the labor force who are willing and able to work but cannot find employment, serving as a key indicator of economic health and labor market conditions.",
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Unemployment hurts both individuals (lost income, skills deteriorate) and society (lost production, social costs). Not all unemployment is equally concerning - someone taking 2 months to find the right job (frictional) is different from someone whose industry disappeared (structural) or was laid off in a recession (cyclical). Economists distinguish these types because they require different policy responses.",
      "key_insight": "The unemployment rate only tells part of the story. It excludes discouraged workers who stopped looking, underemployed workers, and doesn't reveal how long people have been unemployed. The 'natural rate' of unemployment (NAIRU - Non-Accelerating Inflation Rate of Unemployment) represents the lowest sustainable unemployment without triggering inflation, typically 4-5%. Below this, labor shortages drive up wages and prices.",
      "technical_details": "Unemployment Rate = (Number Unemployed / Labor Force) × 100, where Labor Force = Employed + Unemployed. Participation Rate = (Labor Force / Working-Age Population) × 100. U-1 through U-6 measures capture different degrees of labor underutilization. U-3 is the official rate. U-6 includes discouraged workers and part-time for economic reasons.",
      "mathematical_formulation": {
        "unemployment_rate": "u = (U / L) × 100, where U = unemployed, L = labor force",
        "labor_force_participation": "LFPR = (L / WAP) × 100, where WAP = working-age population",
        "employment_population_ratio": "EPR = (E / WAP) × 100, where E = employed",
        "okuns_law": "ΔY = -β × (u - u*), where ΔY = output gap, β ≈ 2, u* = natural rate",

      "types_of_unemployment": {
        "frictional": "Temporary unemployment during job search. Always present in healthy economy. Typically 2-3% of labor force. Duration: weeks to months. Policy: Improve job matching, reduce search costs",
        "structural": "Skills/location mismatch between workers and jobs. Results from technological change, industry shifts, geographic immobility. Duration: months to years. Policy: Education, retraining, relocation assistance",
        "cyclical": "Unemployment from insufficient aggregate demand during recessions. Disappears at full employment. Variable percentage. Policy: Expansionary fiscal/monetary policy",
        "seasonal": "Predictable fluctuations (agriculture, construction, retail). Adjusted out of statistics. Policy: Generally not addressed"
      },
      "measurement_challenges": "Official rate understates true joblessness by excluding discouraged workers and involuntary part-timers. Overstates if includes people casually seeking work. Hidden unemployment in 'gig economy' and self-employed. International comparisons difficult due to different definitions",

        "individual": "Lost income and purchasing power. Skill deterioration. Mental health impacts. Family stress. Reduced retirement savings",
