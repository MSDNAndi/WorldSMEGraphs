    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Unemployment hurts both individuals (lost income, skills deteriorate) and society (lost production, social costs). Not all unemployment is equally concerning - someone taking 2 months to find the right job (frictional) is different from someone whose industry disappeared (structural) or was laid off in a recession (cyclical). Economists distinguish these types because they require different policy responses.",
      "key_insight": "The unemployment rate only tells part of the story. It excludes discouraged workers who stopped looking, underemployed workers, and doesn't reveal how long people have been unemployed. The 'natural rate' of unemployment (NAIRU) represents the lowest sustainable unemployment without triggering inflation. NAIRU is not constant: it varies with labor market institutions, demographics, and structural change. Post-pandemic U.S. evidence suggests NAIRU may have fallen to 3.5-4%. Job search theory explains why unemployment exists even in good times: workers optimally search for wage offers exceeding their reservation wage, which depends on unemployment insurance generosity, savings, and expected wage distribution.",
      "technical_details": "Unemployment Rate = (Number Unemployed / Labor Force) × 100, where Labor Force = Employed + Unemployed. Participation Rate = (Labor Force / Working-Age Population) × 100. BLS publishes U-1 through U-6 measures: U-1 (≥15 weeks unemployed), U-2 (job losers), U-3 (official rate: total unemployed), U-4 (U-3 + discouraged workers), U-5 (U-4 + marginally attached), U-6 (U-5 + part-time for economic reasons). U-6 typically runs 3-4 percentage points above U-3. Duration statistics: median weeks unemployed, mean weeks unemployed, long-term unemployment (≥27 weeks) as percent of total unemployed.",

      "measurement_challenges": "Official rate understates true joblessness by excluding discouraged workers and involuntary part-timers. Overstates if includes people casually seeking work. Hidden unemployment in 'gig economy' and self-employed. International comparisons difficult due to different definitions. U-6 measure (adds discouraged workers and involuntary part-time) provides broader view. Contemporary challenges: platform economy workers (Uber, TaskRabbit) may be underemployed but classified as employed; remote work enables geographic arbitrage; automation displaces workers faster than new jobs created.",

Evidence: European unemployment remained elevated post-1980s recessions, U.S. showed less hysteresis due to flexible labor markets."

        "labor_market": "Unemployment insurance design: trade-off between consumption smoothing and moral hazard (job search disincentives). Optimal UI: declining benefits over time, job search requirements. Employment protection: strict rules reduce hiring/firing, may increase unemployment duration. Minimum wage effects: small negative employment effects at moderate levels, larger effects at high levels relative to median wage",
