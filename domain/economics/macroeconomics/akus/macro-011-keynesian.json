    "definition": "Keynesian economics is a macroeconomic theory developed by John Maynard Keynes that emphasizes the role of aggregate demand in determining economic output and employment, particularly in the short run. It argues that private sector decisions sometimes lead to inefficient macroeconomic outcomes (recessions, unemployment) and advocates active government intervention through fiscal policy (government spending and taxation) and monetary policy to stabilize the business cycle. The theory challenges classical economics' assumption that markets always self-correct to full employment.",

    "statement": "Keynesian economics provides the theoretical foundation for understanding how aggregate demand determines economic output and employment in the short run, and why government intervention through fiscal and monetary policy may be necessary to stabilize market economies and prevent or mitigate recessions.",
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Imagine an economy as a circular flow: businesses pay workers, workers buy from businesses. If something breaks this flow (a crash causes pessimism, a pandemic shuts businesses), spending falls. But unlike classical theory where lower prices/wages would restore balance, Keynes observed that wages are sticky (workers resist pay cuts) and falling prices create expectations of further declines (why buy today?). The economy can get stuck in a low-output trap. The solution: have government inject spending directly to restart the circular flow. When consumers won't spend and businesses won't invest, government becomes the 'spender of last resort.' This demand creates income, which creates more spending (multiplier effect), pulling the economy out of recession.",
      "key_insight": "The revolutionary insight of Keynesian economics is that market economies can fail to self-correct - there's no automatic mechanism ensuring full employment. In classical economics, flexible wages would cure unemployment (unemployed workers accept lower wages until all are hired). Keynes showed why this fails: (1) wages are sticky downward, (2) even if wages fell, this reduces spending which reduces labor demand, (3) expectations matter - pessimism is self-fulfilling. Therefore, the government has a legitimate and necessary role stabilizing the economy through counter-cyclical fiscal policy. During recessions: spend more, tax less. During booms: spend less, tax more. This activist role was controversial in 1936 but became mainstream after WWII.",
      "technical_details": "The simple Keynesian model: Y = C + I + G in closed economy. Consumption function: C = C₀ + MPC·(Y - T). Equilibrium: Y = C₀ + MPC·(Y - T) + I + G. Solving: Y = [1/(1-MPC)]·[C₀ - MPC·T + I + G]. Government spending multiplier: ΔY/ΔG = 1/(1-MPC). Tax multiplier: ΔY/ΔT = -MPC/(1-MPC). Balanced budget multiplier = 1 (since ΔG = ΔT implies ΔY = ΔG). IS-LM extension: IS curve (goods market): Y = C(Y-T) + I(r) + G. LM curve (money market): M/P = L(Y, r). Equilibrium where both clear. Fiscal policy shifts IS. Monetary policy shifts LM. In liquidity trap, LM horizontal at zero bound - monetary policy ineffective, fiscal policy fully effective.",
