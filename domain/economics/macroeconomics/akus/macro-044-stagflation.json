    "title": "Stagflation",
    "definition": "Stagflation is a macroeconomic condition characterized by the simultaneous occurrence of stagnant economic growth (high unemployment, low or negative GDP growth) and high inflation. The term combines 'stagnation' and 'inflation.' It contradicts the traditional Phillips curve tradeoff which suggested inflation and unemployment move inversely. Stagflation typically results from negative supply shocks (oil price spikes, productivity declines) that shift the short-run aggregate supply curve leftward, raising prices while reducing output. It creates a severe policy dilemma: contractionary policy to fight inflation worsens unemployment, while expansionary policy to reduce unemployment worsens inflation.",

    "statement": "Stagflation represents one of the most challenging macroeconomic conditions, combining high inflation with high unemployment and stagnant growth. Understanding its causes (supply shocks) and the policy dilemma it creates is essential for analyzing macroeconomic crises and the evolution of monetary policy from the 1970s to today.",
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Imagine the economy as a car. Normally, you can trade off speed (growth) for fuel efficiency (low inflation) - push the accelerator for more speed, less efficiency; ease off for less speed, more efficiency. This is the Phillips curve tradeoff. Stagflation is like having a flat tire AND running out of gas simultaneously. The flat tire (supply shock) means the car can't go fast even if you floor it (expansionary policy). But flooring it also wastes the little gas you have (inflation). You're stuck going slow with poor efficiency. The only solutions are painful: fix the tire (wait for supply to recover) or accept being stranded while you call for help (accept recession to reset expectations).",
      "key_insight": "The crucial insight is that stagflation results from supply shocks, not demand shocks. Traditional demand-side policies assume a tradeoff: stimulate → more inflation, less unemployment; contract → less inflation, more unemployment. Supply shocks break this tradeoff by affecting both inflation and output in the same direction. A negative supply shock raises prices (by increasing costs) AND reduces output (by reducing capacity). Policymakers face a cruel choice: fight inflation with contraction (worsening already-high unemployment) or fight unemployment with expansion (worsening already-high inflation). The 1970s Fed chose accommodation initially - big mistake. Inflation expectations became unanchored, requiring Volcker's brutal recession to reset them. Modern central banks learned: credibility and anchored expectations are crucial for handling supply shocks without stagflation.",
      "technical_details": "In AD-AS model: Negative supply shock shifts SRAS left (from SRAS₁ to SRAS₂). With AD unchanged: New equilibrium at intersection of AD and SRAS₂ has higher P (inflation) and lower Y (stagnation). This is stagflation. In Phillips curve terms: π = πᵉ - β(u - uⁿ) + ε. Adverse supply shock: ε > 0. This shifts short-run Phillips curve up - higher inflation at every unemployment rate. If central bank accommodates (expands AD to maintain Y): inflation rises, expectations rise (πᵉ ↑), curve shifts up again. Spiral. If central bank contracts (shifts AD left to fight inflation): unemployment rises further. Recession. Optimal response depends on expectations anchoring: well-anchored → accept temporary inflation bump, don't overreact. Unanchored → may need contraction to re-anchor.",
