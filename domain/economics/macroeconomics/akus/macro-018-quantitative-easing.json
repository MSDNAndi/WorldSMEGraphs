    "title": "Quantitative Easing",
    "definition": "Quantitative easing (QE) is an unconventional monetary policy tool used by central banks when conventional interest rate policy is constrained by the zero lower bound. The central bank purchases large quantities of longer-term financial assets (government bonds, mortgage-backed securities) from the private sector, expanding its balance sheet and injecting reserves into the banking system. QE works through multiple channels: lowering long-term interest rates, signaling commitment to easy policy, encouraging portfolio rebalancing toward riskier assets, and potentially boosting asset prices and wealth. First used significantly by Bank of Japan (2001) and adopted globally after the 2008 financial crisis.",

    "statement": "Quantitative easing represents the primary unconventional monetary policy tool used when conventional interest rate policy is constrained by the zero lower bound. Understanding QE's mechanisms, transmission channels, effectiveness, and limitations is essential for analyzing central bank responses to financial crises and the evolution of monetary policy in the 21st century.",
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "When the central bank has already cut interest rates to zero and the economy still needs stimulus, what can it do? It can't push short rates below zero (much). But it can try to lower LONG-term rates by directly buying long-term bonds. When the Fed buys $100 billion of Treasury bonds, it creates $100 billion of new reserves (money) to pay the sellers. Bond prices rise, yields (interest rates) fall. Investors who sold their Treasuries now have cash - they'll likely buy something else (corporate bonds, stocks, real estate), pushing up those prices too. Lower rates and higher asset prices should encourage borrowing, investment, and spending. It's like the central bank saying: 'We'll keep buying until you stop holding cash and start spending.'",
      "key_insight": "The crucial insight is that QE works through multiple channels, not just by lowering rates directly. (1) Portfolio balance: Removing safe assets forces investors into riskier assets, lowering all yields. (2) Signaling: QE demonstrates commitment to keeping policy easy - affects expectations even if mechanics uncertain. (3) Wealth effect: Higher asset prices make households feel richer, boosting consumption. (4) Exchange rate: QE can depreciate currency, helping exports. But QE has limits: (a) If banks don't lend the new reserves, transmission breaks down. (b) If expectations are deflationary (Japan), even massive QE may not generate inflation. (c) Benefits flow disproportionately to asset owners (wealthy), raising inequality concerns. (d) Exit is challenging - markets become dependent on QE.",
      "technical_details": "Central bank balance sheet: Assets = Liabilities. Before QE: Assets (loans to banks, short-term securities), Liabilities (currency, reserves). During QE: Fed buys long-term bonds, pays with reserves → Assets increase (bonds), Liabilities increase (reserves). Mechanical process: Fed buys $100B Treasury from bank → Bank's bond holdings fall $100B, reserve balances rise $100B. Fed's assets rise $100B (bonds), liabilities rise $100B (reserves). Total reserves in system increase. Effect on rates: Simple supply-demand - Fed removes bonds from market → less supply at each price → price up, yield down. Portfolio balance: Investors with cash instead of Treasuries buy next-best substitutes (corporates, MBS, stocks) → those prices rise, yields fall. Signaling: QE announcements move long rates even before purchases - expectations matter.",
