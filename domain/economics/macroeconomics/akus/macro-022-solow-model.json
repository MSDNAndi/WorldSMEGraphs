    "definition": "The Solow-Swan growth model (Solow 1956, Swan 1956) is the foundational neoclassical model of long-run economic growth. It explains how capital accumulation, labor force growth, and technological progress determine an economy's output and growth rate over time. The model's key insight is that capital accumulation alone cannot sustain growth indefinitely due to diminishing returns - economies converge to a 'steady state' where capital per worker and output per worker are constant. Only technological progress (exogenous in basic model) can sustain long-run growth in living standards. The model predicts convergence: poorer countries should grow faster than rich ones, catching up over time.",

    "statement": "The Solow growth model is the foundational framework for understanding long-run economic growth, explaining how capital accumulation, labor force growth, and technological progress determine an economy's productive capacity. Its key insight - that sustained growth requires technological progress due to diminishing returns to capital - remains central to growth economics and development policy.",
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Imagine building a farm. Initially, adding more tractors (capital) dramatically increases output. But eventually, you have so many tractors that adding another barely helps - diminishing returns. If you keep buying tractors, the new ones just replace those breaking down (depreciation), not adding to your fleet. You reach a steady state where tractor-buying matches tractor-breaking. The only way to keep growing is better technology - more productive tractors or better farming techniques. The Solow model applies this logic to economies: save and invest all you want, but diminishing returns mean you'll converge to a steady state. Only innovation (g) keeps living standards rising forever.",
      "key_insight": "The profound insight is the distinction between LEVEL and GROWTH effects. Saving more (higher s) raises your steady-state level of output per worker but doesn't affect long-run growth rate. Only technology (g) determines long-run per capita growth. This has major policy implications: (1) Encouraging saving raises living standards but has diminishing returns and converges to new steady state. (2) Sustainable growth requires innovation policy, not just investment. (3) Convergence: poor countries should grow faster than rich ones as they're further from steady state - hopeful for development. But convergence is CONDITIONAL on having similar technology access and institutions.",

In effective units: ỹ = k̃ᵅ. Capital accumulation: K̇ = sY - δK. Dividing by AL and taking growth rates: dk̃/dt = sỹ - (δ + n + g)k̃ = sk̃ᵅ - (δ + n + g)k̃. Steady state: sk̃*ᵅ = (δ + n + g)k̃*, so k̃* = [s/(δ + n + g)]^(1/(1-α)). Output per effective worker: ỹ* = k̃*ᵅ = [s/(δ + n + g)]^(α/(1-α)). In steady state: Y/L grows at rate g (technology), Y grows at n + g. Growth accounting: ΔY/Y = αΔK/K + (1-α)ΔL/L + ΔA/A. Solow residual ΔA/A = ΔY/Y - αΔK/K - (1-α)ΔL/L measures TFP growth.",
