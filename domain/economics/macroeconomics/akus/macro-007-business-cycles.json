    "definition": "Business cycles are the recurring fluctuations in aggregate economic activity consisting of expansions and contractions that occur around a long-run growth trend. A complete cycle has four phases: (1) expansion - rising output, employment, and incomes; (2) peak - the high point before decline; (3) contraction/recession - falling output, rising unemployment; (4) trough - the low point before recovery. The National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) officially dates US business cycles. Cycles are irregular in duration (typically 2-10 years) and amplitude, driven by shifts in aggregate demand, supply shocks, financial crises, and policy changes.",

    "statement": "Business cycles represent the recurring pattern of expansion and contraction in aggregate economic activity that characterizes market economies. Understanding the phases, causes, indicators, and policy responses to business cycles is essential for macroeconomic analysis, forecasting, and stabilization policy.",
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Think of the economy like breathing - it naturally expands and contracts. During expansion (inhale), businesses hire more, consumers spend more, investment rises, optimism spreads. Eventually, the economy reaches a peak and can't sustain the pace - maybe prices rise too fast, debts become unsustainable, or a shock hits. Then contraction (exhale): spending falls, businesses cut back, unemployment rises, pessimism spreads. At the trough, the economy is depleted but conditions are set for recovery - low prices attract buyers, pent-up demand builds, and the cycle begins again. The goal of stabilization policy is to make the breathing more gentle - avoiding deep contractions and overheating expansions.",
      "key_insight": "The crucial insight is that business cycles are partly self-reinforcing through expectations and financial mechanisms. In expansion: optimism → more spending → more income → more optimism. Rising asset prices → more borrowing capacity → more investment → higher prices. This can overshoot sustainable levels (bubble). In contraction: pessimism → less spending → falling income → more pessimism. Falling asset prices → tighter credit → less investment → lower prices. This can undershoot (depression). Policy aims to moderate these feedback loops: central bank raises rates in boom (cool expectations), cuts in recession (boost confidence). Understanding what triggers turning points - often financial imbalances, external shocks, or policy errors - is key to forecasting.",
      "technical_details": "NBER Business Cycle Dating Committee examines: real personal income less transfers, nonfarm payroll employment, household survey employment, real personal consumption expenditures, wholesale-retail sales, industrial production. Recession declared when 'significant decline in economic activity spread across economy, visible in production, employment, income, lasting more than few months.' Output gap: (Y - Y*)/Y* where Y* is potential GDP (estimated via production function or statistical filters). Okun's Law: 1 percentage point unemployment above natural rate ≈ 2% output gap.
