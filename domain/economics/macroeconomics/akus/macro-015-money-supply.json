    "definition": "The money supply is the total stock of money circulating in an economy at a given time, measured through monetary aggregates of varying liquidity. The most common measures are M1 (currency + checkable deposits, the most liquid), M2 (M1 + savings deposits, money market funds, small time deposits), and the monetary base (MB = currency + bank reserves, which the central bank directly controls). The relationship between the monetary base and broader money supply is determined by the money multiplier, which depends on reserve requirements and the public's currency preferences.",

    ],
    "statement": "The money supply represents the total quantity of money circulating in an economy, measured through monetary aggregates (M1, M2) that capture different degrees of liquidity. Understanding how the central bank controls the monetary base and how this translates to broader money supply through the banking system is essential for analyzing monetary policy, inflation, and macroeconomic stability.",
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Think of money supply like water in a plumbing system. The central bank controls the main valve (monetary base) - it can add water by buying bonds (QE) or drain it by selling. But the total water reaching households (M2) depends on the pipes (banking system). Banks multiply the base water through fractional reserve lending - they keep some in tank (reserves) and pump the rest to borrowers, who deposit it in other banks, which lend again. The 'money multiplier' measures how efficiently pipes transmit water. If pipes are clogged (banks unwilling to lend, like 2008-2012), base water doesn't reach households. If pipes are wide open and everyone borrows, base water multiplies many times. The final price level reflects how much water (money) chases available goods.",
      "key_insight": "The crucial insight is that the central bank controls the monetary base directly but not the broader money supply. M1 and M2 depend on: (1) Reserve requirements (how much banks must hold back), (2) Banks' willingness to lend (affected by risk appetite, regulation, loan demand), (3) Public's currency preferences (more cash holding = smaller multiplier), (4) Interest rates on reserves (higher rate = more excess reserves held). The pre-2008 textbook money multiplier of 10 (with 10% reserve requirement) vastly overstated central bank control. Post-2008 with near-zero reserve requirements and interest on reserves, the multiplier has become even more unstable and often less than 1! This is why modern monetary policy focuses on interest rate targeting, not monetary aggregates.",
      "technical_details": "Monetary base: MB = C + R where C = currency, R = reserves. M1 = C + D where D = demand deposits. Money multiplier: m = M1/MB = (C+D)/(C+R). Define c = C/D (currency ratio), rr = R/D (reserve ratio). Then m = (C/D + 1)/((C/D + R/D)) = (c+1)/(c+rr). If c = 0 (all money in banks): m = 1/rr. If rr = 0.1, m = 10. With c = 0.4, rr = 0.1: m = 1.4/0.5 = 2.8. Quantity theory: MV = PY. In logs: m + v = p + y. If v constant: Δm = Δp + Δy. With y at potential: Δm ≈ Δp (money growth = inflation). Money demand: Md = P × L(Y, r) where L_Y > 0 (transactions demand), L_r < 0 (opportunity cost of holding money). Equilibrium: M/P = L(Y, r) determines r given M and Y.",
