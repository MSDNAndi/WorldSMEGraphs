      "Law of Demand: As price increases, quantity demanded decreases (inverse relationship), ceteris paribus. Exceptions: Giffen goods (strongly inferior goods where income effect dominates substitution effect), Veblen goods (status/prestige goods)",
      "Law of Supply: As price increases, quantity supplied increases (positive relationship), ceteris paribus. Exceptions: backward-bending labor supply at very high wages, speculative assets when sellers expect future price increases",
      "Market equilibrium occurs where supply and demand curves intersect - no surplus or shortage, no inherent tendency to change. Mathematically: Qd(P*) = Qs(P*). Economically: all mutually beneficial trades exhausted",

      "Comparative statics: Demand increase (rightward shift) → higher P*, higher Q*. Supply increase (rightward shift) → lower P*, higher Q*. Magnitude depends on elasticities (responsiveness to price changes)",

    "statement": "Supply and demand analysis explains how markets coordinate the independent decisions of buyers and sellers through price adjustments, establishing equilibrium prices and quantities that clear markets.",
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Markets work through voluntary exchange - buyers and sellers meet and agree on prices. When price is 'right,' everyone who wants to buy at that price finds a seller, and everyone who wants to sell finds a buyer. If price is too high, shelves fill with unsold goods (surplus), pressuring sellers to lower prices. If too low, shelves empty quickly (shortage), allowing sellers to raise prices. This automatic adjustment process reaches equilibrium without central coordination.",
      "key_insight": "The beauty of supply and demand is its decentralization - millions of buyers and sellers, each acting in self-interest, coordinate through the price mechanism. No one needs to know total market supply or demand; they just respond to prices. When conditions change (technology improves, incomes rise, tastes shift), the market automatically adjusts to a new equilibrium. This is Adam Smith's 'invisible hand' in action.",

Comparative statics analyze how parameter changes shift equilibrium: ∂P*/∂a = 1/(b+d) > 0 (demand increase raises price), ∂Q*/∂a = d/(b+d) > 0 (demand increase raises quantity), ∂P*/∂c = -1/(b+d) < 0 (supply increase lowers price), ∂Q*/∂c = b/(b+d) > 0 (supply increase raises quantity). Consumer surplus = ∫[0,Q*] P(Q) dQ - P*Q* = area under demand curve above price. Producer surplus = P*Q* - ∫[0,Q*] P(Q) dQ = area above supply curve below price.
