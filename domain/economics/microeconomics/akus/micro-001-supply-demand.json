      "demand": "The quantity of a good or service consumers are willing and able to purchase at various prices during a given time period",
      "supply": "The quantity of a good or service producers are willing and able to sell at various prices during a given time period",
      "equilibrium": "The price and quantity at which quantity demanded equals quantity supplied, with no tendency to change",
      "surplus": "Excess supply when quantity supplied exceeds quantity demanded at current price, causing downward price pressure",

      "Law of Demand: As price increases, quantity demanded decreases (inverse relationship), all else equal",
      "Law of Supply: As price increases, quantity supplied increases (positive relationship), all else equal",
      "Market equilibrium occurs where supply and demand curves intersect - no surplus or shortage",
      "Price acts as the market mechanism coordinating decisions of buyers and sellers",
      "Shifts in demand (income, preferences, related goods) or supply (costs, technology, expectations) create new equilibria",
      "Changes in price cause movements along curves; changes in other factors cause curve shifts",

        "context": "Price floor above equilibrium creates surplus requiring government intervention"
      }
    ],
    "statement": "Supply and demand analysis explains how markets coordinate the independent decisions of buyers and sellers through price adjustments, establishing equilibrium prices and quantities that clear markets.",
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Markets work through voluntary exchange - buyers and sellers meet and agree on prices. When price is 'right,' everyone who wants to buy at that price finds a seller, and everyone who wants to sell finds a buyer. If price is too high, shelves fill with unsold goods (surplus), pressuring sellers to lower prices. If too low, shelves empty quickly (shortage), allowing sellers to raise prices. This automatic adjustment process reaches equilibrium without central coordination.",
      "key_insight": "The beauty of supply and demand is its decentralization - millions of buyers and sellers, each acting in self-interest, coordinate through the price mechanism. No one needs to know total market supply or demand; they just respond to prices. When conditions change (technology improves, incomes rise, tastes shift), the market automatically adjusts to a new equilibrium. This is Adam Smith's 'invisible hand' in action.",
      "technical_details": "Mathematical representation: Demand Qd = a - bP (downward-sloping, b > 0). Supply Qs = c + dP (upward-sloping, d > 0). Equilibrium: Qd = Qs, solve for Pe = (a-c)/(b+d), Qe = ad+bc/(b+d). Comparative statics analyze how changes in parameters (a, b, c, d) shift equilibrium. Consumer surplus = area under demand curve above price. Producer surplus = area above supply curve below price. Total surplus = consumer + producer surplus.",

      "market_adjustments": "When P > P*, surplus exists. Competition among sellers pushes price down toward P*. When P < P*, shortage exists. Competition among buyers pushes price up toward P*. Speed of adjustment depends on market structure, information, and flexibility.",

More complex models add: elasticities, time dynamics, expectations, market power, externalities, information asymmetries."
