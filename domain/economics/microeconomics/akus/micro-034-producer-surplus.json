    "statement": "Producer surplus measures the welfare gain that producers receive from participating in markets, calculated as the difference between the revenue they receive and their total variable costs. It is a fundamental concept in welfare economics for evaluating market efficiency and the impact of economic policies on sellers.",
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Producer surplus is the profit producers make beyond just covering their costs. If a farmer would sell wheat for $4/bushel (covering costs) but actually gets $7/bushel, the extra $3 is producer surplus - pure economic profit. When prices rise, producers gain surplus even if their costs don't change - they get more money for the same goods. The supply curve shows the minimum price needed to bring each unit to market (marginal cost). The area between price and supply represents all producers' profits - total producer surplus.",
      "key_insight": "Producer surplus reveals that sellers benefit from trade beyond just cost recovery. It measures economic rent - the excess over opportunity cost that sellers capture. Higher prices increase PS by transferring wealth from buyers to sellers. Competitive markets balance consumer and producer surplus to maximize total welfare. When policies intervene (taxes, price controls), producer surplus typically falls, though distribution among producers may change. PS is crucial for analyzing how policies affect different market participants and overall efficiency.",
      "technical_details": "Mathematically: PS = P* × Q* - ∫[0,Q*] P(Q) dQ, where P(Q) is inverse supply function (marginal cost), P* is market price, Q* is quantity sold. For linear supply P = c + dQ: PS = 0.5 × (P* - Pmin) × Q* = 0.5 × (P* - c) × Q*, where Pmin = c is minimum price (supply choke price). Individual producer surplus: PSi = P* × qi - ∫[0,qi] Pi(q) dq. Market producer surplus: PS = Σi PSi. Changes in PS: ΔPS = [0.5 × (P1 - Pmin) × Q1] - [0.5 × (P0 - Pmin) × Q0]. For small price changes: ΔPS ≈ Q × ΔP (first-order approximation). Relationship to profit: Economic profit = PS - Fixed costs. In competitive equilibrium: PS = Variable profit. Long-run: PS = Economic rent to factors with limited supply.",
