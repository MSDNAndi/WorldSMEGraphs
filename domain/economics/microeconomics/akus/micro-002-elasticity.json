    "statement": "Elasticity measures how responsive quantity demanded or supplied is to changes in price or other economic variables. It is fundamental for understanding consumer and producer behavior, predicting market responses to shocks, evaluating policy interventions, and determining optimal pricing strategies.",
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Elasticity answers: 'If price changes by 1%, how much does quantity change?' If answer is 'a lot' (>1%), demand/supply is elastic - responsive. If 'a little' (<1%), it's inelastic - unresponsive. Think of elastic as 'stretchy' - small price change stretches quantity a lot. Inelastic is 'stiff' - even big price changes barely budge quantity. Necessities (insulin, salt) are inelastic - you need them regardless of price. Luxuries (fine dining, yachts) are elastic - easy to cut back if prices rise. This determines who has market power and how policies affect behavior.",
      "key_insight": "Elasticity determines market outcomes: (1) Revenue: Businesses with inelastic demand can raise prices and increase revenue. Elastic demand requires lower prices to boost revenue. (2) Tax burden: Inelastic side (consumers or producers) bears most of tax - they can't easily adjust. (3) Volatility: Inelastic markets have large price swings from small supply/demand shifts (agriculture, oil). Elastic markets adjust mostly through quantity, less through price. (4) Market power: Sellers of inelastic goods have pricing power - consumers have few alternatives. (5) Time: Almost everything becomes more elastic given time to adjust (find substitutes, change production).",
      "technical_details": "Point elasticity: Ed = (dQ/dP) × (P/Q) = derivative × price-quantity ratio. For linear demand Q = a - bP: Ed = -b × (P/Q) - varies along curve, more elastic at high prices. Arc elasticity (midpoint method): Ed = (ΔQ/ΔP) × ((P1+P2)/(Q1+Q2))/2 - avoids endpoint bias. Constant elasticity demand: Q = AP^Ed - elasticity same everywhere. Total revenue: TR = P × Q. dTR/dP = Q(1 + Ed). If Ed > -1 (inelastic): dTR/dP > 0, higher price increases TR. If Ed < -1 (elastic): dTR/dP < 0, higher price decreases TR. Marginal revenue: MR = P(1 + 1/Ed). For monopoly optimization: MR = MC requires |Ed| > 1 (elastic range). Tax incidence: Consumer burden share = Es/(Es + |Ed|). Producer burden share = |Ed|/(Es + |Ed|). More inelastic → larger burden.",
