    "statement": "Consumer surplus measures the welfare gain that consumers receive from participating in markets, calculated as the difference between their total willingness to pay and their actual expenditure. It is a fundamental concept in welfare economics for evaluating market efficiency and the impact of economic policies.",
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Think of consumer surplus as getting a good deal. If you'd pay up to $100 for something but only pay $60, you've gained $40 in value - that's your consumer surplus. When you buy multiple units, each unit at or below your willingness to pay adds to your surplus. The demand curve shows how much people value each additional unit. The area between the demand curve and the price line represents all the 'good deals' consumers get - their total surplus.",
      "key_insight": "Consumer surplus reveals that markets create value beyond just transferring goods and money. It measures the difference between subjective value (what consumers would pay) and objective cost (what they actually pay). This gap is pure welfare gain - economic value created by trade. Competitive markets tend to maximize total surplus (consumer + producer), making them efficient. When policies disrupt markets (taxes, price controls), consumer surplus usually falls, indicating welfare loss. This makes consumer surplus crucial for cost-benefit analysis of policies.",

Market consumer surplus: CS = Σi CSi = horizontal sum. Changes in CS: ΔCS = [0.5 × (Pmax - P1) × Q1] - [0.5 × (Pmax - P0) × Q0]. For small price changes: ΔCS ≈ -Q × ΔP (first-order approximation).
