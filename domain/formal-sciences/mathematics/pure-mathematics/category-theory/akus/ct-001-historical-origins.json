    "statement": "Category theory was developed in the 1940s by Samuel Eilenberg and Saunders Mac Lane as a formal language for describing mathematical structures and their relationships.",
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Category theory emerged from algebraic topology to provide a unified framework for understanding mathematical structures. Rather than focusing on what objects are made of, it focuses on how they relate to each other through morphisms.",
      "key_insight": "Category theory abstracts away from the internal structure of mathematical objects, focusing instead on the relationships (morphisms) between them and how these relationships compose.",
      "technical_details": "Eilenberg and Mac Lane introduced categories in their 1945 paper 'General Theory of Natural Equivalences' to formalize the concept of natural transformation in algebraic topology. The framework proved so powerful it became a universal language for mathematics."
