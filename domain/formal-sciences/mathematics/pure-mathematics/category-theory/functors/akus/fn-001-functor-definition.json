    "statement": "A functor F: C→D is a structure-preserving mapping between categories that maps objects to objects and morphisms to morphisms, preserving composition and identities.",
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "A functor is a 'translator' between categories. It takes an entire category's structure (objects and arrows) and maps it into another category, preserving all the relationships. Think of translating a road network from one country to another while keeping all connections intact.",
      "key_insight": "Functors are morphisms in the category of categories. They represent structure-preserving transformations at a higher level - not just between objects, but between entire mathematical worlds.",
      "technical_details": "A functor F: C→D consists of: (1) An object function: A ↦ F(A) for each object A in C, (2) A morphism function: (f: A→B) ↦ (F(f): F(A)→F(B)) for each morphism f in C. These must satisfy: F(id_A) = id_F(A) and F(g∘f) = F(g)∘F(f)."
