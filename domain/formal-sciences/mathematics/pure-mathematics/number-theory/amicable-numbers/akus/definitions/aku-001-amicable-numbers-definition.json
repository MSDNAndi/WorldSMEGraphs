    "statement": {
      "text": "Two different positive integers form an amicable pair if each is equal to the sum of the proper divisors of the other. For example, 220 and 284 are amicable: the divisors of 220 (excluding 220) are 1,2,4,5,10,11,20,22,44,55,110 which sum to 284, and the divisors of 284 (excluding 284) are 1,2,4,71,142 which sum to 220.",
      "formal": "∀m,n ∈ ℕ, m ≠ n: (m,n) is amicable ⟺ σ(m) - m = n ∧ σ(n) - n = m"

    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Amicable numbers are like 'best friends' in mathematics—each number is defined by what the other gives it. Just as perfect numbers equal their own divisor sum, amicable numbers form pairs where each equals the other's divisor sum. This creates a beautiful reciprocal relationship.",
      "key_insight": "Amicable numbers generalize the concept of perfect numbers from self-reference to mutual reference. While perfect numbers satisfy σ(n) - n = n, amicable pairs satisfy σ(m) - m = n and σ(n) - n = m. This concept extends further to sociable numbers (chains of length > 2).",
      "technical_details": "Let s(n) = σ(n) - n denote the aliquot sum (sum of proper divisors). Then (m,n) are amicable if s(m) = n and s(n) = m with m ≠ n. As of 2024, over 12 million amicable pairs are known, but many questions remain open. Thābit ibn Qurra (9th century) discovered a rule for generating some amicable pairs using primes of specific forms.",
