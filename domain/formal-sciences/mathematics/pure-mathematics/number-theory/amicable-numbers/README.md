# Amicable Numbers

## Overview
This domain covers amicable numbers - pairs of positive integers where each number equals the sum of the proper divisors of the other. These numbers have fascinated mathematicians for over 2500 years.

## Domain Path
`science/math/number-theory/amicable-numbers`

## Key Concepts
- Definition of amicable pairs
- Aliquot sums and divisor functions
- Thābit ibn Qurra's rule
- Historical and cultural significance
- Connection to perfect numbers

## Current AKUs
1. **aku-001-amicable-numbers-definition** - Core definition, examples, and Thābit's rule

## Smallest Amicable Pair
- **220 and 284** (known to ancient Pythagoreans)
- Divisors of 220 (excluding 220): 1,2,4,5,10,11,20,22,44,55,110 → sum = 284
- Divisors of 284 (excluding 284): 1,2,4,71,142 → sum = 220

## Known Amicable Pairs
- Over 12 million amicable pairs known as of 2024
- No odd amicable pairs have been found
- Second smallest pair (1184, 1210) discovered by 16-year-old Nicolo Paganini in 1866

## Relationships
- **Related to**: Perfect Numbers (self-amicable case)
