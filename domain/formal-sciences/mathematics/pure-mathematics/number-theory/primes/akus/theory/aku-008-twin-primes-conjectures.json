      "text": "Twin primes are pairs of prime numbers that differ by 2, such as (3,5), (11,13), and (17,19). The Twin Prime Conjecture, one of the oldest unsolved problems in mathematics, states that there are infinitely many twin prime pairs. While unproven, recent progress has shown there are infinitely many prime pairs with bounded gaps.",
      "formal": "Twin primes: primes p and p+2. Twin Prime Conjecture: |{p prime : p+2 is also prime}| = ∞. Zhang (2013): ∃ infinitely many primes p,q with q-p < 70,000,000. Polymath project reduced to gap < 246."
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "As you count through numbers, primes become rarer and more spread out. But surprisingly, pairs of primes separated by just 2 (like 11 and 13, or 41 and 43) keep appearing even in the millions and billions. Do they continue forever? We believe yes, but after 2000+ years, mathematicians still can't prove it!",
      "key_insight": "Twin primes represent the smallest possible gap between odd primes (gap of 2). While we know infinitely many primes exist, proving infinitely many 'close pairs' exist is fundamentally harder. The conjecture relates to understanding local randomness in prime distribution versus global abundance.",
      "technical_details": "Empirical evidence strongly supports the conjecture: twin primes appear consistent with Hardy-Littlewood predictions. Brun (1919) proved the sum of reciprocals of twin primes converges (Brun's constant ≈ 1.902), unlike all primes (diverges). Zhang (2013) proved bounded gaps theorem: infinitely many prime pairs differ by at most 70M. Collaborative Polymath project reduced bound to 246. GPY (2005) showed conditional result: infinitely many gaps ≤ 16 if certain assumptions hold.",
      "common_misconceptions": [
        "Twin primes are rare—they're less common than single primes but still appear regularly",
        "The conjecture is about gaps of 2 only—there are similar conjectures for other small even gaps",
