    "statement": {
      "text": "Every integer greater than 1 is either prime or can be uniquely represented as a product of prime numbers, up to the order of the factors. This is known as the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic or the Unique Factorization Theorem.",
      "formal": "∀n ∈ ℤ, n > 1: ∃!{p₁, p₂, ..., pₖ} primes, ∃!{e₁, e₂, ..., eₖ} ∈ ℕ: n = p₁^e₁ · p₂^e₂ · ... · pₖ^eₖ where p₁ < p₂ < ... < pₖ"

    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Just as every molecule can be broken down into a unique combination of atoms, every whole number can be broken down into a unique combination of prime numbers. For example, 60 = 2² × 3 × 5, and this is the only way to express 60 as a product of primes (ignoring order).",
      "key_insight": "This theorem establishes primes as the fundamental multiplicative building blocks of integers. The uniqueness of factorization is what makes prime numbers so central to number theory and its applications, from cryptography to algebraic structures.",
      "technical_details": "The theorem has two parts: (1) Existence - every integer > 1 can be factored into primes, proven by strong induction; (2) Uniqueness - this factorization is unique up to order, proven using Euclid's Lemma (if prime p divides ab, then p divides a or p divides b). Without uniqueness, many mathematical structures would not work consistently.",
      "common_misconceptions": [
        "'Up to order' means 12 = 2×2×3 = 2×3×2 = 3×2×2 are all the same factorization",
        "The theorem only applies to positive integers > 1; negative integers and 0, 1 are excluded",
