      "text": "Prime numbers connect to economics through multiple channels: (1) Cryptographic security underlying digital currencies and financial transactions, (2) Mathematical models of market cycles with prime periodicity, (3) Blockchain technology using prime-based hashing, and (4) Financial instrument pricing algorithms. The security of modern financial systems fundamentally relies on computational difficulty of prime factorization.",
      "formal": "Economic applications: (1) Blockchain: hash(block) mod p for security. (2) Digital signatures: RSA for transaction authentication. (3) Secure channels: TLS/SSL for banking. (4) Cycle models: Economic periods T_i where some T_i prime."
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Every time you buy something online or check your bank account, prime numbers protect your money. Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin use prime-based cryptography to ensure no one can fake transactions or steal your digital wallet. Beyond security, some economists study whether economic cycles—like business expansions lasting 7 or 11 years—might have mathematical patterns related to prime numbers.",
      "key_insight": "The global financial system's security infrastructure—from credit cards to stock markets to cryptocurrencies—rests on a mathematical foundation: the difficulty of factoring products of large primes. A breakthrough in factorization would threaten trillions of dollars in digital assets. This makes prime numbers not just mathematical curiosities but pillars of economic security.",
      "technical_details": "Digital currencies use elliptic curve cryptography (related to primes) and RSA signatures for transaction validation. Each Bitcoin transaction requires verifying cryptographic signatures that depend on prime factorization difficulty. Financial institutions use prime-based TLS/SSL for secure communications, processing millions of transactions daily. Some economic cycle theories propose prime-period oscillations (7, 11, 13 year cycles), though empirical support is mixed. High-frequency trading algorithms use prime-sized hash tables for microsecond-level performance.",
      "common_misconceptions": [
        "Only cryptographers care about primes in finance—they're essential for all digital transactions",
        "Economic cycles are truly prime-periodic—this is speculative, not established",
