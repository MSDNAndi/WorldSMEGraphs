# Golden Ratio (φ)

## Overview
This domain covers the golden ratio (φ ≈ 1.618), one of mathematics' most fascinating constants, along with its manifestations in geometry, nature, art, and architecture. The collection includes both verified mathematical properties and critical examination of popular myths.

## Domain Path
`science/math/geometry/golden-ratio`

## Key Concepts

### The Golden Ratio
**φ = (1 + √5)/2 ≈ 1.618033988...**

The unique positive number where φ² = φ + 1, making it the solution to x² - x - 1 = 0.

### Golden Angle
**≈ 137.508° = 360°/φ²**

The optimal angle for phyllotaxis (plant leaf/seed arrangement), minimizing gaps and maximizing sunlight exposure.

## Current AKUs (5)

1. **aku-001-golden-ratio-definition** - Core mathematical definition, properties, and fundamental equation
2. **aku-002-golden-rectangle** - Self-similar rectangles with sides in ratio φ
3. **aku-003-golden-spiral** - Logarithmic spiral with growth factor φ
4. **aku-004-golden-ratio-nature** - Verified occurrences in nature, myths debunked
5. **aku-005-golden-ratio-art-architecture** - Historical and modern uses, claims critically examined

## Key Mathematical Properties

- **Defining equation**: φ² = φ + 1
- **Reciprocal**: 1/φ = φ - 1 ≈ 0.618
- **Continued fraction**: φ = [1; 1, 1, 1, ...] (most irrational number)
- **Fibonacci connection**: lim(Fₙ₊₁/Fₙ) = φ as n → ∞
- **Nested radical**: φ = √(1 + √(1 + √(1 + ...)))

## Verified Occurrences

### In Nature ✓
- **Sunflower seed arrangement**: Golden angle optimization (~137.5°)
- **Pinecone scales**: Fibonacci spiral patterns (5/8, 8/13)
- **Romanesco broccoli**: Fractal Fibonacci spirals
- **Leaf arrangement**: Divergence angles in many plant species

### In Human Culture ✓ (Documented)
- **Le Corbusier's Modulor**: Architectural system explicitly based on φ
- **Salvador Dalí paintings**: Deliberate use of golden rectangles
- **Modern design**: Some logos and layouts use φ intentionally

## Common Myths (Debunked)

### FALSE or Exaggerated Claims ✗
- **Parthenon**: Weak evidence, measurements don't match precisely
- **Great Pyramids**: Coincidental ratios, no historical evidence Egyptians knew φ
- **Mona Lisa**: Retrospective fitting, no contemporary documentation
- **Nautilus shell**: Ratio closer to 4:3, not φ
- **Human body proportions**: No consistent correlation in scientific studies
- **DNA helix**: Numerical coincidence, not structural principle

## Why It Matters

### Mathematical Significance
- **Most irrational number**: Hardest to approximate with fractions
- **Unique algebraic property**: Only positive number where φ² = φ + 1
- **Optimization**: Solves certain packing and distribution problems

### Natural Selection
- Golden angle appears in plants because it optimizes:
  - Seed packing efficiency
  - Sunlight exposure
  - Nutrient distribution

### Historical Interest
- Ancient Greeks (Euclid ~300 BCE): "Extreme and mean ratio"
- Renaissance (Pacioli 1509): Elevated to "divine proportion"
- Modern: Understanding both real mathematics and debunking myths

## Learning Paths

### Elementary (Ages 13-15)

**Time**: ~150 minutes

## Critical Thinking Emphasis

This domain emphasizes **scientific skepticism**:
- Verify claims with evidence
- Understand how selective measurement creates false patterns
- Recognize the difference between:
  - Mathematical certainty (φ² = φ + 1)
  - Natural approximations (sunflower angles ≈ 137.5°)
  - Coincidences (measurements that happen to be near φ)
  - Myths (claims without historical or physical evidence)

## Relationships

### Prerequisites
- Basic algebra and irrational numbers
- Understanding of ratios and proportions
- Geometric concepts (rectangles, spirals)

### Connections
- **Number Theory**: Fibonacci sequence convergence
- **Optimization**: Packing problems
- **Biology**: Phyllotaxis, evolutionary adaptation
- **Art History**: Renaissance proportion theory
- **Design**: Modern applications (when documented)

## Target Audiences
- High school mathematics students
- Art and design students
- Biology students (phyllotaxis)
- Math enthusiasts
- General public interested in nature and aesthetics

## Resources in This Domain
- **5 comprehensive AKUs** covering definition, geometry, applications
- **Critical analysis** of claims with scholarly sources
- **Both verified facts and debunked myths** clearly distinguished
- **Multiple learning paths** for different audiences

## Important Notes

⚠️ **Lower confidence on cultural claims**: While mathematical properties have confidence 0.98-0.99, art/architecture applications have confidence 0.75 due to disputed historical evidence.

✓ **High confidence on math and verified nature**: Mathematical properties and well-documented natural occurrences (phyllotaxis) have strong scientific support.
