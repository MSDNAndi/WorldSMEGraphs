    "statement": {
      "text": "The golden ratio has been used (or claimed to be used) in art and architecture throughout history. While Renaissance thinkers elevated it to a 'divine proportion,' modern scholarship reveals many claims are retrospective projections. Some artists and architects deliberately used it; others' works coincidentally approximate it; many popular claims are myths.",
      "formal": "φ ≈ 1.618 appears in claimed proportions of artworks and buildings, though evidence varies from strong (deliberate use) to weak or false (coincidence, measurement error, or myth)"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Imagine you're an artist trying to create a 'perfect' rectangle for your canvas. Is 1:1 too square? Is 1:2 too long? Maybe 1:1.6 is 'just right'—that's roughly the golden ratio. Throughout history, some artists deliberately used φ in their compositions, while others naturally gravitated toward pleasing proportions that happened to be near φ. However, many famous 'golden ratio' stories are myths created long after the artworks.",
      "key_insight": "The golden ratio's aesthetic appeal is debatable. Scientific studies show mixed results—some find slight preference for golden rectangles, others find no effect. What's certain: Renaissance mystics promoted φ as 'divine,' influencing some later artists. But retrospective claims (e.g., Parthenon, Mona Lisa) often involve selective measurement or confirmation bias. Modern designers sometimes use φ as one tool among many, not a magic formula.",
      "technical_details": "Documented deliberate uses: Le Corbusier's Modulor system (architectural proportions based on φ and human scale), Salvador Dalí's paintings (explicitly referenced φ), some modern logo designs. Dubious claims: Parthenon facade (measurements don't match precisely), Pyramids of Giza (ratios depend on which dimensions you measure), Mona Lisa (proposed proportions require selective choices of features). Preference studies: Fechner (1876) found slight preference for 1:1.6 rectangles, but modern replications show small effect sizes and cultural variation.",

        "The Parthenon was designed using golden ratio—WEAK EVIDENCE: Measurements vary, Greeks didn't emphasize φ",
        "Leonardo da Vinci used golden ratio in Mona Lisa—UNSUPPORTED: No contemporary evidence, proposed rectangles are selective",
