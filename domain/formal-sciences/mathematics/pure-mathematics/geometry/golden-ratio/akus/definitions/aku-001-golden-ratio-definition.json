    "statement": {
      "text": "The golden ratio, denoted by the Greek letter φ (phi), is an irrational number approximately equal to 1.618033988... A line segment is divided in golden ratio when the ratio of the whole line to the longer part equals the ratio of the longer part to the shorter part: (a+b)/a = a/b = φ.",
      "formal": "φ = (1 + √5)/2 ≈ 1.618033988749... where φ² = φ + 1"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Imagine dividing a line into two parts where the relationship between the parts creates perfect visual harmony. The golden ratio is this special proportion—not too balanced (like 1:1) and not too extreme (like 1:10), but 'just right' at about 1.618:1. This ratio appears everywhere from seashells to galaxies, from ancient Greek architecture to modern design.",
      "key_insight": "The golden ratio is the only positive number where squaring it equals adding one to it: φ² = φ + 1. This unique property makes φ the most irrational number (in a technical sense—hardest to approximate with fractions). It's the limit of the ratio of consecutive Fibonacci numbers and appears in pentagons, pentagrams, and the logarithmic spirals found throughout nature.",
      "technical_details": "φ = (1 + √5)/2 is the positive solution to x² - x - 1 = 0. Its decimal expansion is non-repeating and non-terminating. The reciprocal of φ is φ - 1 ≈ 0.618, and φ - 1/φ = 1. In continued fraction form, φ = [1; 1, 1, 1, ...], making it the 'most irrational' number. The golden ratio appears as an eigenvalue in Fibonacci recursion and as the limiting ratio of Fibonacci consecutive terms.",
      "common_misconceptions": [
        "The golden ratio appears everywhere in nature—EXAGGERATED: While it does appear in many places, claims are often overstated or approximate",
        "Ancient Greeks obsessed over the golden ratio—PARTIALLY FALSE: The concept existed but its mystical properties were largely Renaissance inventions",
        "Human face proportions follow the golden ratio—DUBIOUS: Scientific studies show weak to no correlation",
        "The golden ratio makes designs automatically beautiful—FALSE: Good design requires more than mathematical ratios",
