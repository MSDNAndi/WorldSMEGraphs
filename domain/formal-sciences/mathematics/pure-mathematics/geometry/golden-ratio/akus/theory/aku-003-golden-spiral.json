    "statement": {
      "text": "The golden spiral is a logarithmic spiral whose growth factor is the golden ratio φ. It can be approximated by drawing quarter-circle arcs connecting opposite corners of squares in a sequence of golden rectangles. Each quarter turn outward, the spiral's radius increases by a factor of φ.",
      "formal": "Polar equation: r = ae^(bθ) where b = (2/π)ln(φ) ≈ 0.306, giving growth property r(θ + π/2) = φ·r(θ)"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Imagine a snail shell that grows outward in a perfect mathematical pattern. As the shell makes each complete turn, it gets exactly φ times larger. This is the golden spiral—a curve that grows at a constant rate while maintaining its shape. Unlike a circle that just repeats, or a straight spiral that spreads evenly, the golden spiral expands exponentially but smoothly.",
      "key_insight": "The golden spiral is a special case of logarithmic spiral where the growth rate is tied to φ. It's self-similar: if you zoom in or out, the spiral looks the same (scale-invariant). This property makes it mathematically elegant and explains why similar spirals appear in nature—organisms grow by adding new material in proportions that maintain structural integrity.",
      "technical_details": "In polar coordinates (r, θ), the golden spiral is r = ae^(bθ) where b = (2/π)ln(φ) ≈ 0.306. This means r(θ + π/2) = φ·r(θ)—each 90° turn increases radius by φ. The spiral has constant angle (equiangular): the tangent makes a fixed angle ψ = arctan(1/b) ≈ 73° with the radius at every point. Growth rate dr/dθ = br is proportional to distance from origin, creating exponential expansion.",
