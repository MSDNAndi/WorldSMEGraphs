    "key_points": [
      "Caffeine blocks adenosine receptors - delays tiredness signals, doesn't eliminate them",
      "Peak blood levels: 30-60 minutes after consumption",
      "Half-life: 5-6 hours average (range 3-9 hours based on genetics, medications)",
      "Optimal dose for alertness: 75-150mg (single espresso to medium coffee)",

      "Tolerance develops with regular use - periodic abstinence restores sensitivity",

    "statement": {
      "text": "Caffeine is a methylxanthine that acts as a competitive adenosine receptor antagonist, promoting alertness by blocking the brain's sleep signals. With a half-life of 5-6 hours, caffeine consumed at 4 PM is still 50% active at 10 PM. Understanding pharmacokinetics enables strategic timing that maximizes alertness benefits while protecting sleep quality.",
      "formal": "Caffeine Effect = Dose × Absorption Rate × (0.5^(Time/Half-life)); Sleep Impact = Residual Caffeine × Individual Sensitivity"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Caffeine doesn't give you energy - it borrows against tomorrow by blocking your brain's 'tired' signal (adenosine). The adenosine is still building up; you just can't feel it. When caffeine wears off, you feel ALL the accumulated tiredness at once (the crash). Strategic use means getting the alertness boost when you need it without crashing during important moments or disrupting sleep.",
      "key_insight": "The morning cortisol peak (30-45 minutes after waking) already provides natural alertness. Drinking coffee immediately upon waking reduces its effectiveness (adenosine is already low) and builds tolerance faster. Waiting 90-120 minutes after waking maximizes caffeine's impact and preserves sensitivity."
