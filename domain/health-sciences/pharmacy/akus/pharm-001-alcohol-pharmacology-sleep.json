      "Alcohol is metabolized by alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) at ~0.015% BAC/hour",

    "statement": {
      "text": "Ethanol is a central nervous system depressant that affects multiple neurotransmitter systems, particularly enhancing GABA and inhibiting glutamate. Despite initial sedative effects, alcohol disrupts sleep architecture by suppressing REM sleep and causing second-half fragmentation. Cognitive effects persist beyond alcohol clearance, impairing memory consolidation and next-day executive function.",

    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Alcohol is the one substance that makes you feel relaxed and sleepy initially, but borrows against tomorrow's performance. The drink that helps you unwind tonight will make you sleep poorly and think less clearly tomorrow. Understanding the pharmacology helps identify where the breakeven point is.",
      "key_insight": "Alcohol disrupts sleep even when you 'pass out' quickly. The sedative effect wears off after 4-5 hours, causing the second half of the night to be fragmented and lacking restorative REM sleep. This is why you feel unrested after drinking even if you 'slept' 8 hours."
