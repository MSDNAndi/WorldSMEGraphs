      "Even standing in place or brief walking provides substantial benefit",
      "Sedentary behavior is an independent risk factor separate from physical inactivity"
    ],
    "statement": {
      "text": "Prolonged sitting (>6-8 hours/day) is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease, metabolic dysfunction, and mortality - distinct from physical inactivity. Uninterrupted sitting triggers metabolic changes including reduced lipoprotein lipase activity and impaired glucose uptake. Brief movement breaks every 30-60 minutes can mitigate these harms by restoring blood flow and activating metabolic pathways.",
      "formal": "Sitting Risk = f(Duration × Continuous Bouts) - (Movement Breaks × Frequency × Duration)"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Your body is designed to move. When you sit, it's like putting your metabolism on pause - enzymes that process fat and sugar become inactive, blood pools in your legs, and muscles go dormant. The problem isn't sitting itself, but uninterrupted sitting. Breaking up sitting time with brief movement is like hitting the 'unpause' button on your metabolism.",
      "key_insight": "The metabolic harms of prolonged sitting are INDEPENDENT of exercise. You can't 'save up' the harm and offset it with a gym session later. What matters is interrupting sitting frequently. A person who walks briefly every 30 minutes may be healthier than someone who sits all day then runs 5 miles."
