    "summary": "Understanding caffeine's mechanism, timing, and optimal consumption patterns for sustained alertness during conferences",
    "key_points": [
      "Caffeine blocks adenosine receptors - delays tiredness signals, doesn't eliminate them",
      "Peak blood levels: 30-60 minutes after consumption",
      "Half-life: 5-6 hours average (range 3-9 hours based on genetics, smoking, medications)",
      "Optimal dose for alertness: 75-150mg (single espresso to medium coffee)",
      "Cut-off time: No caffeine 6+ hours before intended sleep (earlier if sensitive)",
      "Tolerance develops with regular use - periodic abstinence restores sensitivity",
      "Strategic timing: delay first coffee 90-120 min after waking for max effect"
    ],
    "statement": {
      "text": "Caffeine is an adenosine receptor antagonist that promotes alertness by blocking the brain's sleep signals. With a half-life of 5-6 hours, caffeine consumed at 4 PM is still 50% active at 10 PM. Strategic timing - delaying morning caffeine, respecting the cut-off time, and using moderate doses - maximizes alertness benefits while protecting sleep quality.",
      "formal": "Caffeine_Effect = Dose × Absorption_Rate × (0.5^(Time/Half-life)); Sleep_Impact = Residual_Caffeine × Individual_Sensitivity"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Caffeine doesn't give you energy - it borrows against tomorrow by blocking your brain's 'tired' signal (adenosine). The adenosine is still building up; you just can't feel it. When caffeine wears off, you feel ALL the accumulated tiredness at once (the crash). Strategic use means getting the alertness boost when you need it without crashing during important moments or disrupting sleep.",
      "key_insight": "The morning cortisol peak (30-45 minutes after waking) already provides natural alertness. Drinking coffee immediately upon waking reduces its effectiveness (adenosine is already low) and builds tolerance faster. Waiting 90-120 minutes after waking maximizes caffeine's impact and preserves sensitivity."
