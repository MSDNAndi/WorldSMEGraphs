    "title": "Decision Fatigue: Mechanism and Prevention at Conferences",
    "summary": "Understanding how repeated decision-making depletes cognitive resources and strategies to preserve mental energy at conferences",
    "key_points": [
      "Decision fatigue is the deterioration of decision quality after prolonged decision-making",
      "Average adult makes 35,000 decisions daily - conferences dramatically increase this load",
      "Depleted willpower leads to decision avoidance, impulsivity, or poor choices",
      "Glucose is a key fuel for self-control; low blood sugar exacerbates fatigue",
      "Morning decisions tend to be higher quality than afternoon/evening decisions",
      "Reducing trivial decisions preserves energy for important ones",
      "Strategic breaks and meals restore decision-making capacity"
    ],
    "statement": {
      "text": "Decision fatigue occurs when the act of making decisions depletes a finite cognitive resource, leading to impaired judgment, increased impulsivity, or decision avoidance. Conferences present an unusually high decision load (sessions to attend, people to meet, conversations to have), making attendees vulnerable to poor choices as the day progresses.",
      "formal": "Decision Quality = f(Initial Capacity - Cumulative Decisions - Time); Quality ↓ as Decision Count ↑"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Think of your decision-making ability like a smartphone battery. Every decision - even small ones like 'Which session should I attend?' or 'Should I talk to this person?' - drains a bit of charge. By late afternoon, after hundreds of decisions, you're running on low power mode, making you more likely to choose the default option, avoid decisions entirely, or make impulsive choices.",
      "key_insight": "The brain doesn't distinguish between important and trivial decisions when depleting willpower reserves. Choosing breakfast, picking sessions, deciding where to sit, and whether to ask a question ALL draw from the same limited pool. Smart conference-goers pre-decide trivial matters to save capacity for what matters."
