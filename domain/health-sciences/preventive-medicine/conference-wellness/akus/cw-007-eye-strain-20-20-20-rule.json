    "key_points": [
      "Digital eye strain affects 50-90% of computer users - universal at tech conferences",
      "Symptoms: eye fatigue, dryness, blurred vision, headache, neck/shoulder pain",
      "Blink rate drops from 15/min to 5/min when viewing screens - causing dry eyes",
      "20-20-20 rule: Every 20 minutes, look at something 20 feet away for 20 seconds",
      "Screen position should be 20-26 inches away, slightly below eye level",
      "Blue light filtering has limited evidence for strain but may help sleep if used evening",
      "Room lighting should match screen brightness (not brighter than screen)"
    ],
    "statement": {
      "text": "Digital eye strain (computer vision syndrome) is a complex of ocular and visual symptoms resulting from prolonged near-focus work on digital screens. At conferences with presentations, phone checking, and networking apps, cumulative screen time often exceeds 10+ hours daily. The 20-20-20 rule and proper ergonomics can significantly reduce symptoms.",
      "formal": "Eye Strain = f(Screen_Time × Near_Focus × Reduced_Blink_Rate × Poor_Lighting) - Preventive_Interventions"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Your eyes aren't designed for hours of staring at glowing rectangles 2 feet away. When focusing on screens, your eye muscles stay contracted (like holding a weight), you blink less (drying your eyes), and you receive unnatural light patterns. The 20-20-20 rule is like putting down the weight briefly - relaxing the focus muscles by looking far away.",
      "key_insight": "The reduced blink rate is a major culprit often overlooked. We normally blink 15-20 times per minute, spreading tears evenly. During concentrated screen work, this drops to 3-5 times per minute, causing the tear film to break up and symptoms of dryness, grittiness, and fatigue."
