    "summary": "Understanding how alcohol consumption at conference events affects next-day performance and strategies for professional moderation",
    "key_points": [
      "Alcohol disrupts sleep architecture - reduces REM sleep, causes fragmentation",
      "Even moderate drinking (2-3 drinks) impairs next-day cognitive performance",
      "Blood alcohol clears at ~0.015% per hour; math limits social drinking feasibility",

      "Networking while intoxicated often produces low-quality connections",
      "Social pressure at events is real but can be navigated gracefully",

    ],
    "statement": {
      "text": "Alcohol consumption at conference networking events creates a tradeoff between social lubrication and next-day cognitive performance. Even moderate alcohol consumption disrupts sleep architecture, impairs memory consolidation, causes dehydration, and degrades next-day executive function. Strategic moderation, timing, and alternatives can preserve networking benefits while minimizing costs.",
      "formal": "Conference ROI = Networking_Value(moderate_alcohol) - Cognitive_Cost(sleep_disruption + dehydration + impairment)"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Alcohol is the one 'networking drug' that makes you feel more connected and relaxed in the moment, but borrows against tomorrow's performance. The drink that helps you approach a stranger tonight will make you struggle to remember their name tomorrow. The key is knowing where the breakeven point is for your own physiology.",
      "key_insight": "Alcohol disrupts sleep even when you 'pass out' quickly. The sedative effect wears off after 4-5 hours, causing the second half of the night to be fragmented and lacking restorative REM sleep. This is why you feel unrested after drinking even if you 'slept' 8 hours."
