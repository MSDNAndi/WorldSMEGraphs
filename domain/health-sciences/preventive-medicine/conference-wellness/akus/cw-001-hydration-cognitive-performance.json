      "Even mild dehydration (1-2% body weight loss) impairs cognitive performance",

      "Dehydration reduces working memory, attention, and executive function",

      "Recommended intake: 200-300ml water every 1-2 hours during sessions",

    "statement": {
      "text": "Adequate hydration is essential for maintaining cognitive performance during conferences. Dehydration as mild as 1-2% body weight loss significantly impairs attention, working memory, and executive function - critical faculties for learning and networking. Air-conditioned venues, travel, caffeine, and alcohol consumption at conferences increase dehydration risk.",
      "formal": "Cognitive Performance ∝ Hydration Status; Dehydration ≥1% → Impaired Attention + Reduced Working Memory + Executive Dysfunction"

    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Think of your brain like a computer - it needs adequate cooling (blood flow) and the right chemical environment to process efficiently. Water is the medium for all brain chemistry. When dehydrated, neurons work harder to accomplish the same tasks, leading to mental fatigue and reduced performance.",
      "key_insight": "The threshold for cognitive impairment (1-2% dehydration) occurs BEFORE thirst sensation fully develops. By the time you feel thirsty, your cognitive performance has already declined. Proactive hydration is essential."
