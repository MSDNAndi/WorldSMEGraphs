    "title": "The Science of Power Naps for Cognitive Restoration",
    "summary": "Evidence-based understanding of brief naps (10-20 minutes) for restoring alertness and cognitive function during conferences",
    "key_points": [
      "Optimal power nap duration: 10-20 minutes (avoids deep sleep and sleep inertia)",
      "Benefits appear immediately upon waking with minimal grogginess",
      "NASA study: 26-minute nap improved pilot performance by 34% and alertness by 54%",
      "Naps reduce cortisol and blood pressure; improve mood and creativity",
      "Best timing: early afternoon (1-3 PM) aligns with natural circadian dip",
      "Longer naps (30+ min) risk sleep inertia - impaired function upon waking",
      "Coffee nap: caffeine + 20-min nap is synergistic (caffeine kicks in as you wake)"
    ],
    "statement": {
      "text": "A power nap is a brief sleep episode (10-20 minutes) that provides cognitive restoration without entering deep sleep stages. This duration maximizes benefits (improved alertness, memory, mood) while avoiding sleep inertia (post-sleep grogginess). During demanding conference days, a well-timed power nap can restore performance equivalent to 1-2 hours of nighttime sleep.",
      "formal": "Power Nap (10-20 min) → Stage 1-2 NREM → Cognitive Restoration + Alertness ↑ + No Sleep Inertia"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "A power nap is like a quick reboot for your brain. Just as restarting a sluggish computer clears memory issues and improves performance, a brief nap clears adenosine (the tiredness chemical) and refreshes neural circuits. The trick is waking before you fall into deep sleep, which would make you groggy.",
      "key_insight": "Sleep inertia (post-nap grogginess) is the key variable. Naps under 20 minutes stay in light sleep stages and allow quick rebound. Once you cross into slow-wave deep sleep (~30+ minutes), you'll feel worse before you feel better. The 15-20 minute sweet spot gives maximum benefit with minimum cost."
