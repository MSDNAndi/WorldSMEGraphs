      "After 30 minutes of sitting: metabolic rate drops, blood pooling in legs begins",

      "Movement breaks every 30-60 minutes significantly reduce metabolic and cardiovascular harm",
      "Even standing in place or brief walking provides substantial benefit",
      "Conference venues typically offer stairs, hallways, and outdoor areas for movement"
    ],
    "statement": {
      "text": "Prolonged sitting (>6-8 hours/day) is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease, metabolic dysfunction, and mortality - distinct from physical inactivity. Conferences typically involve 8-12 hours of seated sessions and meals. Brief movement breaks every 30-60 minutes can mitigate these harms by restoring blood flow, activating metabolic pathways, and reducing musculoskeletal strain.",
      "formal": "Sitting Risk = f(Duration × Continuous_Bouts) - (Movement_Breaks × Frequency × Duration)"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Your body is designed to move. When you sit, it's like putting your metabolism on pause - enzymes that process fat and sugar become inactive, blood pools in your legs, and muscles go dormant. The problem isn't sitting itself, but uninterrupted sitting. Breaking up sitting time with brief movement is like hitting the 'unpause' button on your metabolism.",
      "key_insight": "The metabolic harms of prolonged sitting are INDEPENDENT of exercise. You can't 'save up' the harm and offset it with a gym session later. What matters is interrupting sitting frequently. A person who walks briefly every 30 minutes during a conference may be healthier than someone who sits all day then runs 5 miles."
