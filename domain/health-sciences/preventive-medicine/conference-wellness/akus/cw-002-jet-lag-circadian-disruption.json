    "summary": "Understanding circadian rhythm disruption from travel and evidence-based recovery strategies for conference attendees",
    "key_points": [
      "Circadian rhythm is controlled by suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) - the master clock",
      "Recovery rate: ~1 day per time zone crossed (faster westward, slower eastward)",
      "Eastward travel is harder: advancing the clock is more difficult than delaying",
      "Light exposure is the most powerful circadian entrainment tool",
      "Strategic melatonin use (0.5-3mg) can accelerate adaptation",
      "Jet lag impairs memory consolidation, attention, and decision-making",
      "Pre-adaptation (shifting sleep schedule before travel) reduces symptoms"
    ],
    "statement": {
      "text": "Jet lag (circadian dysrhythmia) occurs when rapid travel across time zones desynchronizes the internal circadian clock from the external environment. This misalignment impairs sleep quality, cognitive performance, mood, and physical function - all critical for conference success. Strategic light exposure, sleep timing, and melatonin can accelerate re-entrainment.",
      "formal": "Jet Lag Severity ∝ (Time Zones Crossed × Direction Factor); Recovery ≈ 1 day/zone; Eastward > Westward difficulty"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Your body runs on a 24-hour internal clock synchronized to your home time zone. When you fly across time zones, your internal clock and the external world are out of sync - like having a clock that shows the wrong time. Your body needs time (roughly one day per hour of time difference) to reset.",
      "key_insight": "The direction of travel matters: traveling west 'extends' your day (easier to stay up late), while traveling east 'shortens' it (harder to fall asleep earlier). This is why eastward jet lag typically feels worse and takes longer to resolve."
