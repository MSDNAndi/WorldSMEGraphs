    "summary": "Understanding the cognitive and emotional mechanisms of FOMO and strategies to manage it for better conference experiences",
    "key_points": [
      "FOMO is apprehensive anxiety that others are having rewarding experiences without you",
      "Conferences maximize FOMO triggers: parallel sessions, exclusive events, social media highlight reels",
      "FOMO correlates with lower mood, life satisfaction, and increased social media use",
      "Paradox: chasing everything leads to enjoying nothing (decision overload, exhaustion)",
      "JOMO (Joy of Missing Out) is the intentional practice of accepting and enjoying chosen limits",
      "Strategic session selection based on clear priorities reduces FOMO",
      "Social media during conferences amplifies FOMO; strategic detachment helps"
    ],
    "statement": {
      "text": "Fear of Missing Out (FOMO) is a pervasive apprehension that others are having rewarding experiences from which one is absent. Conferences are FOMO-amplifying environments with parallel sessions, exclusive invite-only events, and social media broadcasting highlight moments. Managing FOMO through intentional priority-setting, acceptance of tradeoffs, and strategic information limits improves both wellbeing and conference outcomes.",
      "formal": "Conference FOMO = Σ(Parallel_Options × Perceived_Value) - Current_Experience_Satisfaction + Social_Media_Exposure"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "At any moment during a conference, there are multiple interesting things happening simultaneously. FOMO is the nagging voice asking 'What if the OTHER session is better? What if I'm missing the party where everyone is making key connections?' This voice, amplified by seeing others' social media posts, can prevent you from fully engaging with whatever you ARE doing.",
      "key_insight": "The cure for FOMO isn't attending everything (impossible) - it's making peace with intentional choices. When you clearly define your priorities and accept that tradeoffs are inevitable, you can fully engage with chosen activities instead of being distracted by unchosen ones. JOMO is the recognition that missing things is a feature, not a bug."
