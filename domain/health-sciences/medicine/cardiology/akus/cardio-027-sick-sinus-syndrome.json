    "summary": "Sick sinus syndrome (SSS) encompasses a spectrum of sinus node dysfunction including sinus bradycardia, sinus arrest, sinoatrial exit block, and chronotropic incompetence, often alternating with atrial tachyarrhythmias (tachy-brady syndrome). Symptomatic patients require permanent pacemaker implantation.",
    "key_points": [
      "Sinus node dysfunction causing inappropriate bradycardia",
      "Tachy-brady syndrome: alternating bradycardia and atrial tachyarrhythmias",
      "Symptoms: syncope, presyncope, fatigue, exercise intolerance, palpitations",
      "Chronotropic incompetence: inadequate HR increase with exercise",
      "Permanent pacemaker is treatment for symptomatic patients",
      "Dual-chamber pacing (DDD) preferred over single-chamber (VVI)"
    ],
    "statement": "Sick sinus syndrome is a manifestation of sinus node dysfunction causing symptomatic bradycardia, often with superimposed atrial tachyarrhythmias (tachy-brady syndrome), requiring permanent pacemaker implantation for symptom relief.",
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "The sinus node is the heart's natural pacemaker. In SSS, this pacemaker becomes unreliable - sometimes too slow, sometimes with long pauses. Many patients also develop AF (the tachy in tachy-brady). The sinus node can't keep up after a tachycardia terminates, causing long pauses and syncope.",
      "key_insight": "The tachy-brady relationship is key: atrial fibrillation and flutter commonly coexist with SSS, and the pause after spontaneous termination of AF can be dangerously long. This dual problem requires both pacing for bradycardia and rate/rhythm control for tachycardia.",
      "technical_details": "SSS results from fibrosis, ischemia, or degeneration affecting the sinus node and surrounding atrial tissue. Intrinsic sinus node dysfunction is distinguished from extrinsic causes (drugs, vagal tone) using atropine/isoproterenol testing. Corrected sinus node recovery time (CSNRT) >550ms indicates dysfunction."
