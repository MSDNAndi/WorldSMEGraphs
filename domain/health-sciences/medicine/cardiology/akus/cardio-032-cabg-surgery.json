    "key_points": [
      "LIMA to LAD is the gold standard graft with 90% patency at 10 years",

    "statement": {
      "text": "Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) is a surgical revascularization procedure that uses arterial (internal mammary artery, radial artery) and venous (saphenous vein) conduits to bypass coronary artery stenoses. CABG provides survival benefit over medical therapy and PCI in patients with left main disease, three-vessel disease (especially with diabetes or reduced EF), and complex coronary anatomy. The LIMA-to-LAD graft is the cornerstone of CABG with excellent long-term patency.",
      "formal": "CABG indications = Left main ≥50% OR 3-vessel CAD + (diabetes OR LVEF <50% OR SYNTAX >22) | LIMA-LAD = gold standard | SVG patency < arterial grafts"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "When coronary arteries are severely narrowed or blocked, the heart muscle beyond the blockage receives inadequate blood flow. CABG creates new pathways (bypasses) around the blockages using vessels harvested from elsewhere in the body. Think of it like building a new highway to bypass traffic congestion. Arterial grafts last longer because they are designed to handle arterial pressures, while vein grafts are adapted to the arterial environment and tend to fail over time.",
      "key_insight": "The LIMA-to-LAD graft is the single most important determinant of long-term outcomes after CABG. Its use reduces mortality by 40% at 10 years compared to vein grafts alone. The LAD supplies the largest territory of myocardium, and the LIMA has unique properties (resistance to atherosclerosis, endothelial function) that maintain patency. Maximizing arterial revascularization with bilateral internal mammary arteries further improves outcomes.",
      "technical_details": "CABG is typically performed via median sternotomy with cardiopulmonary bypass (heart-lung machine). The heart is arrested with cardioplegia solution, allowing anastomoses to be performed on a still heart. Off-pump CABG (OPCAB) maintains cardiac motion using stabilizers but has similar long-term outcomes. Hybrid revascularization combines minimally invasive LIMA-LAD with PCI to other vessels."
