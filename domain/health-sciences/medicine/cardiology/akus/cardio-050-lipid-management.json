    "title": "Lipid Management",
    "summary": "Lipid management is essential for cardiovascular risk reduction, with statins as first-line therapy. Treatment intensity is guided by risk category: high-intensity statins for ASCVD or very high-risk patients, with LDL goals of <70 mg/dL or <55 mg/dL for highest risk. PCSK9 inhibitors and ezetimibe are add-on therapies for patients not at goal.",
    "key_points": [
      "Statins are first-line; intensity based on ASCVD risk category",
      "High-intensity statins: atorvastatin 40-80mg, rosuvastatin 20-40mg (reduce LDL ≥50%)",
      "LDL goal <70 mg/dL for very high-risk ASCVD; <55 mg/dL per ESC guidelines",
      "Add ezetimibe if not at goal on maximally tolerated statin",

      "Risk-enhancing factors: Lp(a), hsCRP, CAC score guide shared decision-making"
    ],
    "statement": "Lipid management for cardiovascular risk reduction centers on statin therapy with intensity matched to risk category, LDL goals stratified by ASCVD history and risk factors, and add-on therapies (ezetimibe, PCSK9 inhibitors) for patients not achieving target levels.",
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Think of LDL as the 'lousy' cholesterol that deposits in arteries. Lower is better for cardiovascular prevention, especially in patients who already have ASCVD. Statins are the backbone of treatment, but some patients need additional agents to get LDL low enough.",
      "key_insight": "The paradigm has shifted from 'fire and forget' to 'treat to target' - we now aim for specific LDL thresholds based on risk category. For very high-risk patients (prior MI, multiple events), LDL <55 mg/dL may be targeted, and PCSK9 inhibitors become important tools.",
      "technical_details": "Statins inhibit HMG-CoA reductase, reducing hepatic cholesterol synthesis and upregulating LDL receptor expression. PCSK9 inhibitors prevent PCSK9-mediated LDL receptor degradation, markedly increasing LDL clearance. Ezetimibe blocks intestinal cholesterol absorption via NPC1L1."
