    "title": "Wolff-Parkinson-White Syndrome",
    "summary": "Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome is a pre-excitation syndrome caused by an accessory pathway (bundle of Kent) that bypasses the AV node, creating the characteristic delta wave on ECG. Patients may develop atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia (AVRT) or, dangerously, rapidly conducted atrial fibrillation that can degenerate into ventricular fibrillation. Catheter ablation is curative.",
    "key_points": [
      "ECG triad: short PR (<120ms), delta wave, wide QRS",
      "Accessory pathway conducts faster than AV node (ventricular pre-excitation)",
      "Orthodromic AVRT: narrow QRS, antegrade through AV node",
      "Antidromic AVRT: wide QRS, antegrade through accessory pathway",
      "AF with WPW: rapid irregular wide-complex tachycardia; potentially fatal",
      "Avoid AV nodal blockers (adenosine, verapamil, digoxin) in pre-excited AF"
    ],
    "statement": "Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome is a pre-excitation condition with an accessory pathway causing delta waves on ECG and predisposing to AVRT and rapidly conducted atrial fibrillation, requiring catheter ablation for definitive treatment.",
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "The heart normally has one electrical 'bridge' between atria and ventricles (AV node), which slows conduction for proper timing. In WPW, there's a second 'bridge' (accessory pathway) that conducts faster, causing early ventricular activation (pre-excitation) seen as the delta wave.",
      "key_insight": "The danger of WPW is atrial fibrillation: the accessory pathway can conduct AF at rates >300 bpm, overwhelming the ventricles and triggering VF. That's why AV nodal blockers (which normally help in AF) are CONTRAINDICATED - they remove competition, allowing even faster accessory pathway conduction.",
      "technical_details": "The accessory pathway (bundle of Kent) lacks decremental conduction properties of the AV node. Orthodromic AVRT uses antegrade AV node conduction and retrograde accessory pathway; antidromic uses the reverse. Pre-excited AF shows irregular wide-complex rhythm with varying QRS morphology."
