    "title": "Cardiac Stress Testing",
    "summary": "Cardiac stress testing evaluates myocardial ischemia by increasing cardiac workload through exercise or pharmacologic stress, combined with ECG monitoring and/or imaging (nuclear, echocardiography, CMR). Test selection depends on baseline ECG interpretability, exercise capacity, and pretest probability of coronary artery disease.",
    "key_points": [
      "Exercise treadmill test (ETT) is first-line for patients who can exercise with interpretable ECG",
      "Imaging (nuclear or echo) required if baseline ECG abnormalities (LBBB, LVH, digoxin, WPW, paced rhythm)",
      "Pharmacologic stress (regadenoson, adenosine, dobutamine) for patients unable to exercise adequately",
      "Duke Treadmill Score integrates exercise time, ST depression, and angina for prognosis",
      "Sensitivity ~70% for ETT alone; ~85-90% with imaging; specificity ~75-85%",
      "Absolute contraindications: acute MI <2 days, unstable angina, uncontrolled arrhythmias, severe AS"
    ],
    "statement": "Stress testing is a cornerstone of ischemia evaluation, providing diagnostic and prognostic information. The choice of stress modality (exercise vs pharmacologic) and imaging (none, nuclear, echo, CMR) should be individualized based on patient characteristics, pretest probability, and local expertise.",
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Exercise increases myocardial oxygen demand through elevated heart rate, blood pressure, and contractility. In the presence of obstructive CAD, this demand cannot be met, resulting in ischemia manifesting as ST depression, wall motion abnormalities, or perfusion defects. Pharmacologic vasodilators (adenosine) cause differential flow between normal and stenotic vessels (coronary steal), detected by perfusion imaging.",
      "key_insight": "Pre-test probability determines post-test interpretation. In intermediate-probability patients, stress testing adds the most value. In very low (<5%) or very high (>90%) probability patients, testing may not significantly change management. Imaging adds value when ECG is uninterpretable or for localization/extent of ischemia.",
      "technical_details": "Standard Bruce protocol increases speed/grade every 3 minutes. Target HR is 85% of age-predicted maximum (220-age). Adequate workload is >5 METs or >85% MPHR. ST depression ≥1mm horizontal/downsloping 80ms after J-point is positive. Duke Score = exercise time - (5 × ST depression) - (4 × angina index)."

  "clinical_features": {
    "pathophysiology": {
      "mechanism": "Exercise increases HR, BP, and contractility, raising myocardial oxygen demand (MVO2). In normal coronaries, flow increases 4-5 fold. Stenotic arteries cannot augment flow proportionally, creating supply-demand mismatch. Vasodilators cause maximal dilation of normal vessels with minimal effect on stenotic beds (fixed resistance), creating heterogeneous flow detectable by perfusion imaging.",
      "key_pathways": [
        "Exercise → increased HR, BP, contractility → increased MVO2",
        "Stenotic arteries → limited flow reserve → ischemia with increased demand",
        "Vasodilators → coronary steal → differential perfusion between territories",
        "Dobutamine → increased contractility/HR → unmasked wall motion abnormalities"
