    "title": "Cardiac Magnetic Resonance Imaging (CMR)",
    "summary": "Cardiac MRI is a non-invasive imaging modality that uses magnetic fields and radiofrequency pulses to produce detailed images of cardiac anatomy, function, tissue characterization, and perfusion without ionizing radiation. It is considered the gold standard for ventricular volumetric assessment and myocardial tissue characterization.",
    "key_points": [
      "Gold standard for LV and RV volume and ejection fraction quantification",
      "Late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) identifies scar and fibrosis patterns",

    "statement": "Cardiac MRI provides unparalleled tissue characterization and functional assessment, enabling precise diagnosis of cardiomyopathies, ischemic heart disease, congenital heart disease, and cardiac masses through sequences including cine imaging, LGE, T1/T2 mapping, and stress perfusion.",
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "CMR works by aligning hydrogen protons in the body using a strong magnetic field, then perturbing them with radiofrequency pulses. Different tissues relax at different rates, creating contrast. Gadolinium accumulates in areas of expanded extracellular space (scar, fibrosis), appearing bright on LGE images.",
      "key_insight": "The pattern of late gadolinium enhancement is pathognomonic for different conditions: subendocardial/transmural LGE indicates infarction; mid-wall LGE suggests non-ischemic cardiomyopathy; epicardial LGE indicates myocarditis or sarcoidosis.",
      "technical_details": "Standard CMR protocol includes: (1) Localizers and scout images, (2) Cine imaging in multiple planes for function, (3) T2-weighted images for edema, (4) Native T1 mapping, (5) Early gadolinium enhancement for thrombus, (6) Late gadolinium enhancement 10-15 min post-contrast, (7) T1 mapping post-contrast for ECV calculation."
