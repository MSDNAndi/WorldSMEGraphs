    "title": "Long QT Syndrome (LQTS)",
    "summary": "Long QT syndrome is a cardiac ion channelopathy characterized by prolonged ventricular repolarization (QTc >470ms in males, >480ms in females) that predisposes to polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (torsades de pointes) and sudden cardiac death. LQTS can be congenital (genetic mutations in ion channels) or acquired (drugs, electrolyte abnormalities).",
    "key_points": [
      "Congenital LQTS caused by mutations in potassium (KCNQ1-LQT1, KCNH2-LQT2) or sodium (SCN5A-LQT3) channels",
      "Acquired LQTS from QT-prolonging drugs, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, hypocalcemia",
      "Torsades de pointes is the characteristic polymorphic VT with twisting QRS axis",
      "Beta-blockers are first-line therapy; ICD for high-risk patients or breakthrough events",
      "LQT1 triggered by exercise (swimming); LQT2 by auditory stimuli; LQT3 occurs at rest/sleep",
      "Avoid all QT-prolonging medications (www.crediblemeds.org); correct electrolytes"
    ],
    "statement": "Long QT syndrome represents a spectrum of inherited and acquired disorders of cardiac repolarization that create the substrate for life-threatening arrhythmias. Genotype-phenotype correlations guide risk stratification and therapy, with prevention of triggers and beta-blocker therapy forming the cornerstone of treatment.",
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "The QT interval represents ventricular depolarization and repolarization. When repolarization is prolonged, early afterdepolarizations can occur during the vulnerable phase, triggering reentrant arrhythmias. The prolonged QT creates a dispersion of refractoriness across the myocardium, setting up the substrate for torsades de pointes.",
      "key_insight": "The three major genotypes have distinct triggers and responses: LQT1 (most common, 30-35%) occurs with exercise/swimming and responds well to beta-blockers; LQT2 (25-30%) is triggered by auditory stimuli and emotional stress; LQT3 (5-10%) occurs at rest/sleep and may paradoxically worsen with bradycardia (respond to pacing/mexiletine).",
      "technical_details": "QTc is calculated using Bazett's formula: QTc = QT/√RR. QTc >500ms significantly increases risk of torsades. The Schwartz score combines ECG findings (QTc, T-wave morphology, torsades), clinical history (syncope, congenital deafness), and family history for diagnosis. Genetic testing confirms diagnosis and guides genotype-specific therapy."

  "clinical_features": {
    "pathophysiology": {
      "mechanism": "Mutations in genes encoding cardiac ion channels alter the balance between inward (sodium, calcium) and outward (potassium) currents during the action potential plateau. Loss-of-function potassium channel mutations (LQT1, LQT2) reduce repolarizing current, while gain-of-function sodium channel mutations (LQT3) increase depolarizing current. Both prolong action potential duration and create substrate for early afterdepolarizations and triggered activity.",
      "key_pathways": [
        "KCNQ1 mutation → reduced IKs → prolonged repolarization during sympathetic activation",
        "KCNH2 mutation → reduced IKr → prolonged repolarization and susceptibility to hypokalemia",
        "SCN5A mutation → persistent INa → prolonged plateau phase; worse at slow heart rates",
        "Prolonged APD → early afterdepolarizations → triggered ventricular premature beats",
        "Dispersion of repolarization → reentry → polymorphic VT (torsades de pointes)"
      ],
      "clinical_significance": "LQTS is a leading cause of sudden cardiac death in young, otherwise healthy individuals. Early diagnosis through screening (syncope workup, family screening) and appropriate therapy can be life-saving."
