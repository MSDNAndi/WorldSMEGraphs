    "title": "Cardiac Tamponade",
    "summary": "Cardiac tamponade is a life-threatening condition in which pericardial fluid accumulation causes compression of cardiac chambers, impaired diastolic filling, reduced cardiac output, and hemodynamic collapse. It requires urgent recognition and emergent pericardiocentesis or surgical drainage.",
    "key_points": [
      "Beck's triad: hypotension, jugular venous distension, muffled heart sounds (seen in acute tamponade)",
      "Pulsus paradoxus >10 mmHg (inspiratory SBP drop) is highly sensitive for tamponade",
      "Echocardiography shows RA collapse in late diastole and RV collapse in early diastole",
      "Rate of fluid accumulation matters more than volume - rapidly accumulating effusions cause tamponade with <200mL",
      "Emergent pericardiocentesis is life-saving; echo-guided subxiphoid approach is standard",
      "Electrical alternans on ECG indicates large effusion with swinging heart"
    ],
    "statement": "Cardiac tamponade represents a clinical-hemodynamic continuum from pericardial effusion to circulatory collapse. The diagnosis is clinical, supported by echocardiographic findings, and requires emergent drainage. The key pathophysiologic concept is equalization of intracardiac diastolic pressures due to external compression.",
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "The pericardium is a relatively stiff sac. When fluid accumulates, the intrapericardial pressure rises. Once it equals or exceeds right atrial pressure, cardiac filling is impaired. Inspiration normally increases venous return to the right heart, but in tamponade this occurs at the expense of left heart filling (ventricular interdependence), causing pulsus paradoxus.",
      "key_insight": "The rate of fluid accumulation determines clinical presentation: rapidly accumulating effusions (trauma, aortic dissection) cause tamponade with small volumes, while slowly accumulating effusions (malignancy, uremia) allow pericardial stretch and may reach >1L before hemodynamic compromise.",
      "technical_details": "Echocardiographic signs in order of sensitivity: (1) RA collapse in late diastole (most sensitive), (2) RV collapse in early diastole (more specific), (3) IVC plethora without respiratory variation, (4) >25% mitral E velocity respiratory variation, (5) Swinging heart with large effusion. Hemodynamic catheterization shows equalization of diastolic pressures (RA = RVEDP = PCWP ± 5mmHg)."

  "clinical_features": {
    "pathophysiology": {
      "mechanism": "Pericardial fluid accumulation increases intrapericardial pressure. When this exceeds RA pressure, venous return and cardiac filling are compromised. Both ventricles share a fixed total volume (ventricular interdependence), so inspiration-augmented right heart filling reduces left heart filling, causing pulsus paradoxus and reduced cardiac output.",
      "key_pathways": [
        "Pericardial fluid accumulation → increased intrapericardial pressure",
        "Intrapericardial pressure exceeds RA pressure → impaired venous return",

        "Compensatory tachycardia and vasoconstriction initially maintain BP",
        "Decompensation → hypotension, shock, PEA arrest"
      ],
      "clinical_significance": "Tamponade is a medical emergency with near 100% mortality if untreated. Even small volumes (100-200mL) can cause tamponade if rapid accumulation (e.g., cardiac perforation). Pericardiocentesis can be life-saving with as little as 30-50mL fluid removal."
