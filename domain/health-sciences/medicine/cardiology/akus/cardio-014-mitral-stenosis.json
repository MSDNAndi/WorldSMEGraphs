    "title": "Mitral Stenosis",
    "summary": "Mitral stenosis (MS) is narrowing of the mitral valve orifice obstructing blood flow from the left atrium to left ventricle during diastole. Rheumatic heart disease remains the primary cause worldwide. Chronic LA pressure elevation leads to LA enlargement, atrial fibrillation, pulmonary hypertension, and heart failure. Treatment involves diuretics, rate control, anticoagulation for AF, and intervention for symptomatic severe MS.",
    "key_points": [
      "Rheumatic heart disease is the most common cause (globally); degenerative in developed countries",
      "Normal MVA 4-6 cm²; Severe MS: MVA ≤1.5 cm² or mean gradient ≥10 mmHg",
      "LA enlargement → Atrial fibrillation → Thromboembolism (anticoagulate all MS with AF)",
      "Auscultation: Low-pitched diastolic rumble at apex with loud S1 and opening snap",
      "Symptom triggers: Tachycardia, pregnancy, fever (decrease diastolic filling time)",
      "Intervention: PMBC (percutaneous mitral balloon commissurotomy) for favorable anatomy"
    ],
    "statement": "Mitral stenosis creates obstruction to left atrial emptying, causing pulmonary congestion and atrial fibrillation, managed with rate control, anticoagulation, and percutaneous or surgical intervention for severe symptomatic disease.",
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Think of mitral stenosis as a narrowed doorway between the left atrium and ventricle. When the door can't open fully, traffic backs up - the atrium enlarges, pressure builds, and congestion spills back into the lungs. Anything that speeds up the heart (exercise, fever, pregnancy) worsens symptoms because there's less time for blood to squeeze through the narrow opening during diastole.",
      "key_insight": "MS is uniquely pressure-dependent on DIASTOLIC TIME. Unlike other valvular lesions where systolic function dominates, MS symptoms worsen with tachycardia because shortened diastole limits LA emptying. Rate control is therefore CRITICAL - beta-blockers to slow heart rate and lengthen diastole.",
      "technical_details": "Mitral valve area can be calculated by pressure half-time (MVA = 220/PHT) or planimetry. Wilkins score (0-16) grades leaflet mobility, thickening, calcification, and subvalvular involvement - score ≤8 predicts good PMBC outcome. Mean gradient >5-10 mmHg and PASP >50 mmHg indicate hemodynamic significance."
