      "text": "HFpEF management centers on SGLT2 inhibitors (Class 2a recommendation), diuretics for congestion, and aggressive management of comorbidities (hypertension, atrial fibrillation, obesity, diabetes, coronary disease). Unlike HFrEF, traditional neurohormonal agents have not demonstrated mortality benefit until SGLT2 inhibitors.",

      "intuition": "HFpEF is fundamentally different from HFrEF - the heart squeezes normally but doesn't relax properly, leading to high filling pressures. Since the problem isn't contractile failure, drugs that help HFrEF (which target neurohormonal activation of systolic dysfunction) mostly don't help HFpEF.",
      "key_insight": "SGLT2 inhibitors represent a paradigm shift - they're the first drugs to reduce HF hospitalizations in HFpEF. Their mechanism may involve improved cardiac energetics, reduced preload/afterload, and anti-inflammatory effects rather than pure neurohormonal blockade."
