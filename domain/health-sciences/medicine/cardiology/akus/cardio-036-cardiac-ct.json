    "key_points": [
      "Coronary CT angiography (CCTA) is first-line for stable chest pain with intermediate pretest probability",
      "Coronary artery calcium (CAC) scoring quantifies atherosclerotic burden (Agatston score)",
      "CAC score of 0 indicates very low 10-year cardiovascular event risk (<1%)",

      "Essential for TAVR planning (annular sizing, vascular access assessment)",
      "Radiation exposure: ~3-5 mSv for CCTA, <1 mSv for CAC scoring"
    ],
    "statement": {
      "text": "Cardiac computed tomography encompasses coronary CT angiography (CCTA) for evaluating coronary artery stenosis and coronary artery calcium (CAC) scoring for cardiovascular risk stratification. CCTA has excellent negative predictive value for excluding significant coronary artery disease in patients with stable chest pain and intermediate pretest probability. CAC scoring quantifies calcified atherosclerotic plaque using the Agatston method and reclassifies cardiovascular risk. Cardiac CT is also essential for structural heart disease evaluation and TAVR procedural planning.",
      "formal": "CCTA indication = Stable chest pain + Intermediate pretest probability | CAC score interpretation: 0 = very low risk, 1-99 = mild, 100-399 = moderate, ≥400 = severe"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Cardiac CT takes rapid X-ray images of the heart synchronized to the ECG, allowing visualization of the coronary arteries without invasive catheterization. For CCTA, contrast dye is injected to opacify the coronary arteries. For calcium scoring, no contrast is needed - the scanner simply detects calcified plaque in coronary vessel walls. Think of it as a 'non-invasive angiogram' that can identify blockages or confirm arteries are clean.",
      "key_insight": "The key strength of CCTA is its negative predictive value - if CCTA shows no significant stenosis, you can confidently rule out obstructive CAD without invasive angiography. However, positive findings may require functional testing or invasive confirmation due to limited positive predictive value. CAC scoring is most valuable when it changes management - a zero score in borderline-risk patients may justify avoiding statin therapy.",
      "technical_details": "Modern 256+ slice CT scanners acquire the entire heart in a single heartbeat. ECG-gated acquisition freezes cardiac motion. Prospective triggering reduces radiation by only imaging during diastole. Iterative reconstruction algorithms improve image quality while reducing dose. Beta-blockers slow heart rate to <60 bpm for optimal image quality. Sublingual nitroglycerin dilates coronary arteries. Iodinated contrast (60-100 mL) is required for CCTA but not CAC scoring."
