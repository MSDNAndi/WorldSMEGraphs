    "title": "Brugada Syndrome",
    "summary": "Brugada syndrome is an inherited cardiac channelopathy characterized by distinctive coved-type ST elevation in right precordial leads (V1-V3) and increased risk of ventricular fibrillation and sudden cardiac death, typically occurring during rest or sleep. It results from loss-of-function mutations in cardiac sodium channel genes (SCN5A in ~25%).",
    "key_points": [
      "Type 1 (coved) ECG pattern diagnostic: ≥2mm J-point elevation with coved ST-segment and negative T-wave in V1-V3",
      "Type 2/3 patterns (saddleback) are suggestive but not diagnostic; require provocation testing",
      "SCN5A mutations found in ~25% of cases; autosomal dominant inheritance",
      "Risk factors: male sex, fever, sodium channel blockers, excessive alcohol, vagal states",
      "ICD indicated for survivors of SCA or documented spontaneous sustained VT",
      "Quinidine and isoproterenol for electrical storm; catheter ablation of epicardial substrate emerging"
    ],
    "statement": "Brugada syndrome is a major cause of sudden cardiac death in young adults with structurally normal hearts. Diagnosis requires recognition of the characteristic Type 1 ECG pattern (spontaneous or drug-induced), and risk stratification guides ICD implantation decisions. Fever can unmask the pattern and trigger arrhythmias.",
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Loss-of-function sodium channel mutations reduce INa current in the right ventricular outflow tract epicardium, where Ito (transient outward potassium current) is prominent. This creates a transmural voltage gradient (phase 2 reentry substrate) and the characteristic ST elevation on surface ECG. The resulting early repolarization in epicardium can trigger ventricular fibrillation.",
      "key_insight": "The Type 1 (coved) pattern is diagnostic; Types 2 and 3 (saddleback) require sodium channel blocker provocation to convert to Type 1 for diagnosis. Events typically occur at rest, during sleep, or with vagal enhancement (after large meals). Fever is a major trigger that can both unmask the pattern and precipitate arrhythmias.",
      "technical_details": "Diagnostic criteria require Type 1 pattern in ≥1 right precordial lead (V1-V3) positioned in standard or high (2nd-3rd intercostal) position, either spontaneous or after provocation with sodium channel blockers (ajmaline, flecainide, procainamide). High lead placement increases sensitivity."

  "clinical_features": {
    "pathophysiology": {
      "mechanism": "SCN5A loss-of-function mutations reduce sodium current (INa), predominantly affecting the RVOT epicardium where transient outward potassium current (Ito) is prominent. Reduced INa with unopposed Ito causes early repolarization of epicardium relative to endocardium, creating transmural voltage gradient manifesting as ST elevation. Phase 2 reentry from this dispersion triggers VF.",
      "key_pathways": [
        "SCN5A mutation → reduced INa → loss of action potential dome in epicardium",
        "Prominent Ito in RVOT epicardium → early repolarization",
