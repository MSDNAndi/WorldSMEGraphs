    "title": "Echocardiography",
    "summary": "Echocardiography is the most widely used cardiac imaging modality, utilizing ultrasound waves to assess cardiac structure, function, hemodynamics, and valvular pathology in real-time. It encompasses transthoracic (TTE), transesophageal (TEE), stress, and intracardiac approaches.",
    "key_points": [
      "TTE is first-line for most cardiac evaluations; TEE provides superior visualization of posterior structures",
      "Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is assessed by Simpson's biplane method or visual estimation",
      "Doppler echocardiography enables assessment of valvular stenosis/regurgitation severity and hemodynamics",
      "Strain imaging (speckle tracking) detects subclinical myocardial dysfunction before EF decline",
      "Stress echocardiography detects inducible ischemia and assesses valvular response to exercise",
      "Point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) provides rapid bedside cardiac assessment in emergencies"
    ],
    "statement": "Echocardiography is the cornerstone of cardiac imaging, providing real-time assessment of chamber size and function, valvular structure and hemodynamics, pericardial disease, and intracardiac masses. Its portability, lack of radiation, and comprehensive hemodynamic data make it indispensable in cardiovascular medicine.",
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Ultrasound waves are transmitted through chest wall tissues and reflected at tissue interfaces. The timing and intensity of returning echoes create images. Moving blood cells cause Doppler frequency shifts proportional to flow velocity, enabling hemodynamic calculations.",
      "key_insight": "The combination of 2D imaging, M-mode, and Doppler (pulsed-wave, continuous-wave, color flow, tissue Doppler) provides comprehensive structural and hemodynamic assessment. Each modality has specific strengths: CW Doppler for high velocities, TDI for diastolic function.",
      "technical_details": "Standard TTE includes parasternal long and short axis, apical 4/3/2-chamber, and subcostal views. LVEF by Simpson's biplane traces endocardial borders at end-diastole and end-systole in apical 4 and 2-chamber views. Valve gradients use modified Bernoulli equation: ΔP = 4V²."
