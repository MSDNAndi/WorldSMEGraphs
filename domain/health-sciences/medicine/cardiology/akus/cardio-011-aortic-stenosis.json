    "title": "Aortic Stenosis",
    "summary": "Aortic stenosis (AS) is progressive narrowing of the aortic valve causing LV outflow obstruction. Degenerative calcific AS is the most common etiology in adults. The classic symptom triad is angina, syncope, and heart failure. Once symptoms develop, prognosis worsens dramatically without intervention. TAVR and SAVR are curative treatments based on patient risk profile.",
    "key_points": [
      "Degenerative calcific AS is most common cause in adults; bicuspid valve in younger patients",
      "Classic triad: angina, syncope, heart failure (HF has worst prognosis)",
      "Severe AS: AVA <1.0 cm², mean gradient >40 mmHg, jet velocity >4 m/s",
      "Symptoms mandate valve replacement - medical therapy alone has poor outcomes",
      "TAVR increasingly preferred; SAVR remains option for low-risk patients",
      "Careful BP management - avoid excessive afterload reduction"
    ],
    "statement": "Aortic stenosis is progressive valve obstruction causing LV pressure overload with classic symptoms of angina, syncope, and heart failure, requiring aortic valve replacement (TAVR or SAVR) once symptomatic or severe with LV dysfunction.",
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "The aortic valve is like a door that the heart pushes blood through. When the door gets stiff and narrow, the heart muscle has to work harder. Eventually it can't keep up, and blood backs up (heart failure) or can't reach the brain (syncope) or coronary arteries (angina).",
      "key_insight": "The key is recognizing when to intervene: once the classic symptoms develop, survival drops dramatically without surgery - 2-3 years for angina/syncope, <2 years for heart failure. Even asymptomatic severe AS may warrant intervention if EF drops or exercise testing is abnormal.",
      "technical_details": "Calcification of leaflets restricts opening. Chronic pressure overload causes concentric LVH. As AS progresses, the LV-aortic pressure gradient increases. Diastolic dysfunction precedes systolic dysfunction. Low-flow, low-gradient AS with reduced EF is a challenging subset requiring dobutamine stress echo for diagnosis."
