    "key_points": [

      "Biventricular pacing resynchronizes left ventricular contraction",
      "CRT-D (with defibrillator) vs CRT-P (pacemaker only) based on sudden death risk",

    "statement": {
      "text": "Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) is a device-based treatment for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction and electrical dyssynchrony. By pacing both ventricles, CRT restores coordinated ventricular contraction, improving cardiac output, reducing mitral regurgitation, and promoting reverse remodeling. Indications include LVEF ≤35%, LBBB with QRS ≥150 ms, and NYHA class II-IV symptoms despite optimal medical therapy. CRT reduces heart failure hospitalizations, improves quality of life, and extends survival.",
      "formal": "CRT indication = LVEF ≤35% + QRS ≥150 ms + LBBB + NYHA II-IV on GDMT | Response predictors: LBBB morphology, QRS width, female, non-ischemic"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "In a normal heart, both ventricles contract simultaneously. In heart failure with LBBB, the electrical signal is delayed to the left ventricle, causing the septum and lateral wall to contract out of sync. This dyssynchrony wastes energy and worsens heart failure. CRT adds a pacing lead to the left ventricle that triggers contraction simultaneously with the right ventricle, restoring coordination.",
      "key_insight": "QRS width and morphology are the best predictors of CRT response. LBBB ≥150 ms has the strongest evidence; non-LBBB or narrow QRS rarely benefit. The non-responder problem (30-40%) is often due to extensive scar preventing mechanical improvement despite electrical resynchronization.",
      "technical_details": "CRT requires three leads: right atrial, right ventricular, and left ventricular (coronary sinus). The LV lead is positioned via the coronary sinus into a lateral or posterolateral cardiac vein. Optimal positioning away from scar tissue improves outcomes. Conduction system pacing (His bundle or left bundle branch area pacing) is an emerging alternative."
