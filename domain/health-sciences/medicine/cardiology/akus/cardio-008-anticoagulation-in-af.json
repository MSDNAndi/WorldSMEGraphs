      "CHA2DS2-VASc score determines anticoagulation need",

    "statement": {
      "text": "Anticoagulation for AF stroke prevention is indicated based on CHA2DS2-VASc score (\u22652 in men, \u22653 in women). Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are preferred over warfarin for non-valvular AF due to superior efficacy, safety, and convenience. Warfarin remains indicated for mechanical heart valves and moderate-severe mitral stenosis.",
      "formal": "AF Anticoagulation = CHA2DS2-VASc \u22652 (men) / \u22653 (women) \u2192 DOAC preferred \u2192 Warfarin if valve disease \u2192 LAA occlusion if OAC contraindicated"

    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "AF causes the atria to quiver rather than contract effectively, allowing blood to pool and clot, especially in the left atrial appendage. Anticoagulants prevent these clots from forming, reducing stroke risk by 60-70% compared to no treatment.",
      "key_insight": "CHA2DS2-VASc identifies who needs anticoagulation, not who is safe without it. Even a score of 1 in men warrants consideration. Bleeding risk (HAS-BLED) helps optimize modifiable factors but rarely justifies withholding anticoagulation."
