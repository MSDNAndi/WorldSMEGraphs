      "HFrEF: EF \u226440% - reduced ejection fraction",

    "statement": {
      "text": "Heart failure is classified by left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF): HFrEF (\u226440%), HFmrEF (41-49%), HFpEF (\u226550%), and HFimpEF (previously \u226440%, now >40%). Functional status is graded by NYHA class (I-IV based on symptom limitation), while ACC/AHA stages (A-D) describe disease progression from risk factors through advanced refractory HF.",
      "formal": "HF Classification = EF-based [HFrEF \u226440% | HFmrEF 41-49% | HFpEF \u226550%] + NYHA [I-IV] + Stage [A-D]"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Heart failure classification matters because treatments differ dramatically. HFrEF has multiple proven life-prolonging therapies (ACEi, beta-blocker, MRA, SGLT2i, ARNI), while HFpEF historically had no mortality benefit therapies until SGLT2 inhibitors. Classification guides treatment selection.",
      "key_insight": "LVEF alone doesn't tell the whole story. A patient with EF 35% (HFrEF) in NYHA Class I has no symptoms despite low EF, while a patient with EF 55% (HFpEF) in NYHA Class III is severely limited. Both EF-based and symptom-based classifications inform prognosis and treatment.",
      "technical_details": "The new HFimpEF category recognizes that patients who recover EF still need guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) continued - stopping therapy often leads to EF decline and clinical deterioration. HFmrEF is a 'gray zone' where evidence is emerging but less robust than HFrEF."
