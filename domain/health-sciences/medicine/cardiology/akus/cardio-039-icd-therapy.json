    "title": "Implantable Cardioverter-Defibrillator (ICD) Therapy",
    "summary": "Implantable cardioverter-defibrillators are life-saving devices that continuously monitor cardiac rhythm and deliver therapy (antitachycardia pacing or shocks) for ventricular tachyarrhythmias. ICDs are indicated for primary prevention in patients with severely reduced ejection fraction and for secondary prevention after survived sudden cardiac arrest or sustained ventricular arrhythmias.",
    "key_points": [
      "Primary prevention: LVEF ≤35% on GDMT for ≥3 months with NYHA II-III symptoms",
      "Secondary prevention: Survived SCA, sustained VT with hemodynamic compromise, or VT with structural heart disease",
      "ICD reduces mortality in appropriate candidates; NNT ~10-15 over 5 years",
      "Transvenous ICD (TV-ICD) is standard; subcutaneous ICD (S-ICD) avoids vascular complications",
      "Antitachycardia pacing (ATP) terminates monomorphic VT painlessly in 90%+ of cases",
      "Inappropriate shocks from SVT/AF are common; meticulous programming reduces incidence"
    ],
    "statement": "ICD therapy represents the cornerstone of sudden cardiac death prevention. Patient selection requires careful consideration of etiology, reversibility, life expectancy, comorbidities, and patient preferences. Optimal programming minimizes inappropriate therapies while ensuring effective treatment of life-threatening arrhythmias.",
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "The ICD continuously monitors intracardiac electrograms through sensing leads. When ventricular rate exceeds programmed cutoffs, the device applies detection algorithms to distinguish VT/VF from SVT. For VT, it can attempt painless termination with antitachycardia pacing. If unsuccessful or if VF is detected, high-energy shocks (up to 40J biphasic) are delivered to restore normal rhythm.",
      "key_insight": "Modern ICD programming emphasizes minimizing inappropriate shocks (which increase mortality and reduce quality of life) while maintaining efficacy. Longer detection intervals, higher rate cutoffs, and SVT discriminators significantly reduce inappropriate therapies without compromising safety.",
      "technical_details": "Standard transvenous ICD has RV lead for sensing/pacing/shocking ± RA lead for dual-chamber discrimination. Programming includes: (1) Detection zones (VF zone typically >200bpm, VT zone 150-200bpm), (2) Detection duration (30/40 criterion or NID), (3) SVT discriminators (morphology, stability, onset suddenness), (4) Therapy tiers (ATP before shocks for VT zone)."
