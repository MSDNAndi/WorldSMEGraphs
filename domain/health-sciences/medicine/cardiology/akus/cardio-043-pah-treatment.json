    "title": "Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (PAH) Treatment",
    "summary": "PAH treatment involves targeted therapies acting on three main pathways: prostacyclin pathway (epoprostenol, treprostinil, selexipag), endothelin pathway (bosentan, ambrisentan, macitentan), and nitric oxide-cGMP pathway (sildenafil, tadalafil, riociguat). Treatment is guided by risk stratification and typically involves upfront combination therapy for intermediate/high-risk patients.",
    "key_points": [
      "Three therapeutic pathways: prostacyclin, endothelin receptor antagonists, PDE5 inhibitors/sGC stimulators",
      "Upfront combination therapy (ERA + PDE5i) recommended for most newly diagnosed WHO FC II-III patients",
      "IV/SQ prostacyclins reserved for high-risk patients or those failing oral combination therapy",
      "Vasoreactivity testing identifies rare calcium channel blocker responders (<10% of IPAH)",
      "Risk stratification (low/intermediate/high) guides therapy escalation decisions",
      "Lung transplantation for patients failing maximal medical therapy"
    ],
    "statement": "Modern PAH management uses a goal-directed, risk-stratification approach with upfront combination therapy targeting multiple pathways simultaneously. Treatment aims to achieve low-risk status (WHO FC I-II, normal RV function, 6MWD >440m, low BNP) and improve survival and quality of life.",
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "PAH results from imbalance between vasoconstrictors (endothelin, thromboxane) and vasodilators (prostacyclin, nitric oxide) in pulmonary arteries. Treatment restores this balance by augmenting vasodilatory pathways and blocking vasoconstrictors, while also addressing vascular remodeling.",
      "key_insight": "The paradigm has shifted from sequential add-on therapy to upfront combination therapy based on AMBITION trial showing superiority of initial ambrisentan + tadalafil. Patients should be treated to low-risk targets, with escalation if goals not met at 3-6 month follow-up.",
      "technical_details": "Prostacyclins (most potent): epoprostenol IV, treprostinil SC/IV/inhaled, selexipag oral. ERAs (block ET-1): bosentan (hepatotoxicity monitoring), ambrisentan (peripheral edema), macitentan (best trial data). PDE5i/sGC stimulators: sildenafil, tadalafil, riociguat (cannot combine with PDE5i)."
