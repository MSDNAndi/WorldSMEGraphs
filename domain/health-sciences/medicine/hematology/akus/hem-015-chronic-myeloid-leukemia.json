    "summary": "Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a myeloproliferative neoplasm defined by the Philadelphia chromosome t(9;22)(q34;q11), resulting in the BCR-ABL1 fusion gene encoding a constitutively active tyrosine kinase. CML is the paradigm of targeted cancer therapy, as tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have transformed it from a fatal disease to a manageable chronic condition with near-normal life expectancy.",
    "key_points": [
      "Defined by Philadelphia chromosome t(9;22) and BCR-ABL1 fusion",
      "Three phases: chronic, accelerated, and blast crisis",
      "TKI therapy (imatinib, dasatinib, nilotinib, bosutinib, ponatinib) is standard",

    "statement": "Chronic myeloid leukemia is a myeloproliferative neoplasm characterized by the Philadelphia chromosome and BCR-ABL1 oncoprotein, effectively controlled with tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy targeting the fusion protein's constitutive kinase activity.",
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "CML is like a car with a stuck accelerator (BCR-ABL1) - the engine keeps revving (myeloid proliferation) uncontrollably. TKIs are like mechanics who can specifically disconnect that stuck accelerator without touching the rest of the engine. This precision makes CML the success story of targeted cancer therapy.",
      "key_insight": "Before imatinib (2001), median CML survival was 3-5 years; now it approaches normal life expectancy. This transformation represents the first successful example of rationally designed targeted cancer therapy and won the 2009 Lasker Award.",
      "technical_details": "BCR-ABL1 encodes a 210kDa fusion protein (p210) with constitutive tyrosine kinase activity. It activates RAS/MAPK, PI3K/AKT, and STAT5 pathways, driving proliferation and inhibiting apoptosis. TKIs competitively inhibit ATP binding to the kinase domain. Resistance mutations (T315I 'gatekeeper') require third-generation TKIs (ponatinib) or allosteric inhibitors (asciminib)."
