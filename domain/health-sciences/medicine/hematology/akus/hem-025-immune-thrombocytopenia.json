    "summary": "Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP, formerly idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura) is an autoimmune disorder characterized by isolated thrombocytopenia due to antibody-mediated platelet destruction and impaired platelet production. It is a diagnosis of exclusion. Treatment aims to prevent bleeding rather than normalize platelet count, with corticosteroids as first-line therapy and IVIG for urgent situations.",
    "key_points": [
      "Diagnosis of exclusion: isolated thrombocytopenia (<100 × 10⁹/L) without other cause",
      "Primary ITP (no identifiable cause) vs Secondary ITP (SLE, HIV, HCV, drugs)",
      "Mechanism: autoantibodies against platelet glycoproteins (GPIIb/IIIa, GPIb/IX)",
      "Treatment goal: prevent bleeding, not normalize platelet count",
      "First-line: Corticosteroids (prednisone 1 mg/kg or dexamethasone 40 mg × 4 days)",
      "Urgent treatment: IVIG (1 g/kg × 1-2 days) for rapid platelet increase"
    ],
    "statement": "Immune thrombocytopenia is an acquired autoimmune disorder causing isolated thrombocytopenia through antibody-mediated platelet destruction and impaired megakaryopoiesis, managed with corticosteroids as first-line therapy with the goal of preventing bleeding rather than achieving a normal platelet count.",
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "In ITP, the immune system mistakenly tags platelets as foreign and destroys them. Antibodies coat platelets, which are then eaten by macrophages in the spleen. At the same time, these antibodies suppress platelet production. The result: very low platelets but normal bone marrow trying (and failing) to compensate.",
      "key_insight": "ITP is a diagnosis of EXCLUSION - you must rule out other causes of thrombocytopenia first. The treatment goal is preventing bleeding, not achieving a 'normal' platelet count. Many patients do fine with platelets of 30-50 without treatment.",
      "technical_details": "Antiplatelet antibodies target GPIIb/IIIa (most common) or GPIb/IX. Fc-receptor mediated phagocytosis occurs primarily in the spleen. TPO-RAs (romiplostim, eltrombopag) work by stimulating megakaryopoiesis to overcome destruction. Rituximab depletes B-cells producing autoantibodies."
