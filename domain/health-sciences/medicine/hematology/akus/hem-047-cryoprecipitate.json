    "summary": "Cryoprecipitate is a plasma-derived blood component enriched in fibrinogen, factor VIII, von Willebrand factor, factor XIII, and fibronectin, primarily used for fibrinogen replacement in hypofibrinogenemia and as alternative therapy for bleeding disorders when specific concentrates are unavailable.",
    "key_points": [
      "Contains concentrated fibrinogen (150-250 mg per unit), factor VIII, VWF, factor XIII, fibronectin",
      "Primary indication: hypofibrinogenemia (<100-150 mg/dL) with bleeding or pre-procedure",
      "Standard dose: 1 unit per 5-10 kg body weight; typically 10 pooled units for adults",
      "Each unit raises fibrinogen approximately 5-10 mg/dL in average adult",
      "Largely replaced by fibrinogen concentrate and factor concentrates where available",
      "ABO-compatible preferred but not required; small plasma volume minimizes antibody risk"
    ],
    "statement": "Cryoprecipitate is a blood component prepared by controlled thawing of fresh frozen plasma at 1-6°C, resulting in a cold-insoluble precipitate rich in fibrinogen, factor VIII, von Willebrand factor, factor XIII, and fibronectin, primarily indicated for fibrinogen replacement in hypofibrinogenemia and as emergency treatment for hemophilia A or von Willebrand disease when specific factor concentrates are unavailable.",
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "When FFP is slowly thawed in the cold, certain proteins precipitate out because they are less soluble at low temperatures. This 'cryo-precipitate' is enriched in fibrinogen and other proteins, providing a concentrated source of fibrinogen in a small volume - much more efficient than giving large volumes of FFP for isolated fibrinogen deficiency.",
      "key_insight": "While cryoprecipitate has been the traditional treatment for hypofibrinogenemia, fibrinogen concentrate offers advantages including viral inactivation, standardized dosing, no ABO considerations, and room temperature storage. However, availability and cost often make cryoprecipitate the practical choice in many settings.",
      "technical_details": "Cryoprecipitate is prepared by thawing FFP at 1-6°C and collecting the precipitate that forms. Each unit (10-20 mL) contains ≥150 mg fibrinogen and ≥80 IU factor VIII. Storage at ≤-18°C allows 1-year shelf life. Once thawed, must use within 6 hours (single unit) or 4 hours (pooled). Pooled units from 5-10 donors typically used for adult dosing."
