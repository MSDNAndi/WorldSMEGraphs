    "title": "Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (TTP)",
    "summary": "TTP is a life-threatening thrombotic microangiopathy caused by severe ADAMTS13 deficiency (<10% activity), resulting in accumulation of ultra-large von Willebrand factor multimers, platelet aggregation, and microthrombi formation. Without treatment, mortality exceeds 90%; with plasma exchange, survival exceeds 80%.",
    "key_points": [
      "ADAMTS13 activity <10% is diagnostic; acquired (autoantibodies) >> congenital",
      "Classic pentad (MAHA, thrombocytopenia, neuro, renal, fever) present in only 5%",
      "Practical diagnosis: MAHA + thrombocytopenia without alternative explanation",
      "PLASMIC score predicts likelihood of severe ADAMTS13 deficiency",
      "Treatment: plasma exchange (daily until response) + steroids + caplacizumab",
      "DO NOT give platelets - may worsen thrombosis; give plasma exchange urgently"

    "statement": "TTP is a hematologic emergency defined by severe ADAMTS13 deficiency causing microangiopathic hemolytic anemia and thrombocytopenia, requiring immediate plasma exchange therapy and adjunctive immunosuppression with mortality exceeding 90% if untreated.",
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "ADAMTS13 is the 'scissors' that cuts ultra-large von Willebrand factor (UL-vWF) into normal sizes. Without it, UL-vWF accumulates like sticky strands catching platelets, forming microthrombi that shred RBCs (schistocytes) and block small vessels (stroke, kidney injury).",
      "key_insight": "Don't wait for the full pentad - it's present in only 5% of cases. MAHA + thrombocytopenia = presume TTP until proven otherwise. Start plasma exchange empirically while awaiting ADAMTS13 results. Time is brain and kidneys.",
      "technical_details": "ADAMTS13 (a disintegrin and metalloprotease with thrombospondin motifs-13) cleaves vWF at Tyr1605-Met1606 bond. Acquired TTP results from IgG autoantibodies inhibiting ADAMTS13. Congenital TTP (Upshaw-Schulman syndrome) has biallelic ADAMTS13 gene mutations."
