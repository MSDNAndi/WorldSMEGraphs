    "title": "Essential Thrombocythemia",
    "summary": "Essential thrombocythemia (ET) is a BCR-ABL-negative myeloproliferative neoplasm characterized by sustained thrombocytosis (≥450 × 10⁹/L) arising from clonal megakaryocyte proliferation. Driver mutations include JAK2 V617F (~55%), CALR (~25%), and MPL (~5%), with 10-15% being 'triple-negative.' ET presents with vasomotor symptoms, thrombosis, and paradoxical bleeding with extreme thrombocytosis.",
    "key_points": [
      "Diagnostic threshold: Platelet count ≥450 × 10⁹/L sustained",
      "Driver mutations: JAK2 V617F (55%), CALR (25%), MPL (5%), triple-negative (10-15%)",
      "CALR-mutated ET has lowest thrombosis risk and best prognosis",
      "Risk stratification: IPSET-thrombosis score guides treatment intensity",
      "Very low/low risk: aspirin alone or observation",
      "High risk (age ≥60 or prior thrombosis): cytoreduction with hydroxyurea or anagrelide"
    ],
    "statement": "Essential thrombocythemia is a clonal megakaryocytic disorder with isolated thrombocytosis, managed with risk-adapted antiplatelet and cytoreductive therapy to prevent thrombohemorrhagic complications while monitoring for transformation to myelofibrosis.",
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Think of ET as a 'megakaryocyte production line running in overdrive' - driver mutations cause excessive platelet production. Paradoxically, extremely high platelets (>1000) can cause BLEEDING by binding von Willebrand factor, creating acquired vWD.",
      "key_insight": "Unlike PV, ET patients have mutational heterogeneity with different prognoses: CALR-mutated ET has lowest thrombosis risk and longest survival, while JAK2-mutated ET behaves more like PV with higher thrombotic risk.",
      "technical_details": "CALR mutations (type 1 and type 2) cause mutant calreticulin to bind MPL receptor, activating JAK-STAT signaling. MPL W515L/K mutations directly activate the thrombopoietin receptor. Triple-negative cases may harbor non-canonical mutations or represent reactive thrombocytosis."
