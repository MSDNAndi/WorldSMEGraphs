    "title": "Fresh Frozen Plasma",
    "summary": "Fresh frozen plasma (FFP) is a blood component containing all coagulation factors, used for correction of multiple factor deficiencies, warfarin reversal when PCCs unavailable, TTP plasma exchange, and massive transfusion, with evidence-based indications limiting inappropriate use.",
    "key_points": [
      "Contains all coagulation factors at near-physiologic concentrations",
      "Primary indication: multiple coagulation factor deficiency with bleeding or pre-procedure",
      "4-factor PCC preferred over FFP for warfarin reversal in major bleeding",
      "Dose: 10-15 mL/kg typically raises factor levels by 20-30%",
      "Must be ABO-compatible (contains anti-A/B antibodies)",
      "Common inappropriate uses include nutritional support and volume expansion"
    ],
    "statement": "Fresh frozen plasma (FFP) is a blood component separated from whole blood and frozen within 8 hours, containing all coagulation factors, fibrinogen, and plasma proteins, indicated for treatment of multiple coagulation factor deficiencies, therapeutic plasma exchange in TTP, and as part of massive transfusion protocols, while inappropriate use for single factor deficiencies, volume expansion, or nutritional support should be avoided.",
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "FFP is essentially frozen plasma containing all the clotting factors and other plasma proteins. Unlike factor concentrates that target specific deficiencies, FFP provides a balanced replacement of all factors - making it valuable when multiple factors are low (liver disease, DIC) but inefficient when only one factor is deficient.",
      "key_insight": "The shift away from FFP for warfarin reversal toward 4-factor PCCs reflects better evidence: PCCs work faster, require smaller volumes, and don't carry the same risk of volume overload and transfusion reactions. FFP remains important for TTP and situations where specific factor concentrates are unavailable.",
      "technical_details": "FFP is prepared by separating plasma from whole blood within 8 hours and freezing at ≤-18°C, preserving labile factors V and VIII. One unit is approximately 200-250 mL from whole blood donation; apheresis plasma units are larger. Storage at ≤-18°C allows 1-year shelf life. Once thawed, FFP must be used within 24 hours (or 5 days if stored at 1-6°C as 'thawed plasma' with reduced factor V/VIII)."
