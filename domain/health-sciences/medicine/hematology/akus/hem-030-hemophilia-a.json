    "title": "Hemophilia A",
    "summary": "Hemophilia A is an X-linked recessive bleeding disorder caused by deficiency or dysfunction of coagulation factor VIII. It is the most common severe inherited bleeding disorder, affecting ~1 in 5,000 male births. Severity correlates with factor VIII activity level: severe (<1%), moderate (1-5%), mild (5-40%). Treatment centers on factor VIII replacement, with newer options including extended half-life products and the bispecific antibody emicizumab.",
    "key_points": [
      "X-linked recessive: affects males; females are carriers (may have mild bleeding)",
      "Factor VIII deficiency: severity based on factor level (<1% severe, 1-5% moderate, 5-40% mild)",
      "Bleeding pattern: deep tissue, muscle, joints (hemarthroses) - NOT petechiae",
      "Laboratory: prolonged aPTT with normal PT; low factor VIII activity",
      "Treatment: factor VIII replacement (recombinant or plasma-derived)",
      "Inhibitor development: major complication (~30% of severe patients develop anti-FVIII antibodies)"
    ],
    "statement": "Hemophilia A is an X-linked inherited bleeding disorder caused by factor VIII deficiency, characterized by deep tissue and joint bleeding, diagnosed by prolonged aPTT with low factor VIII activity, and managed with factor replacement therapy or emicizumab with careful monitoring for inhibitor development.",
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Factor VIII is the 'cofactor accelerator' that amplifies factor X activation during clotting. Without enough FVIII, clot formation is slow and fragile. Bleeding occurs into joints and muscles because these areas need robust clot formation to withstand mechanical stress.",
      "key_insight": "Hemophilia A causes 'secondary hemostasis' failure - the initial platelet plug forms normally (so no petechiae), but the fibrin mesh reinforcement is inadequate, leading to delayed, deep bleeding. Inhibitor development is the most challenging complication, requiring bypass agents or immune tolerance induction.",
      "technical_details": "Factor VIII circulates bound to von Willebrand factor (vWF), which protects it from degradation. When activated, FVIIIa binds phospholipid surfaces and accelerates FIXa-mediated activation of factor X by ~200,000-fold. The F8 gene on Xq28 has common mutations including intron 22 inversions (45% of severe cases)."
