    "summary": "Hereditary or acquired thrombophilia caused by deficiency of protein S, a vitamin K-dependent anticoagulant cofactor that enhances activated protein C function in the degradation of factors Va and VIIIa, resulting in increased risk of venous thromboembolism.",
    "key_points": [
      "Protein S functions as cofactor for activated protein C (APC) in degradation of factors Va and VIIIa",
      "Three types: Type I (quantitative), Type II (qualitative), Type III (free protein S deficiency)",
      "VTE risk 2-11 fold increased in heterozygotes; homozygotes present with neonatal purpura fulminans",
      "Acquired deficiency occurs in pregnancy, oral contraceptives, liver disease, DIC, vitamin K deficiency",
      "Diagnosis requires both functional and immunologic assays; affected by acute thrombosis and anticoagulation",
      "Treatment: anticoagulation for acute VTE; duration and prophylaxis based on clinical context"
    ],
    "statement": "Protein S deficiency is an inherited or acquired thrombophilia resulting from reduced levels or function of protein S, a vitamin K-dependent plasma glycoprotein that serves as a nonenzymatic cofactor for activated protein C in the inactivation of procoagulant factors Va and VIIIa, thereby increasing the risk of venous and occasionally arterial thrombosis.",
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Protein S acts as a helper molecule for the anticoagulant protein C system. When activated protein C (APC) needs to shut down clotting by destroying factors Va and VIIIa, it requires protein S as a cofactor to work efficiently. Without adequate protein S, the brakes on clotting are less effective, leading to a prothrombotic state.",
      "key_insight": "Protein S circulates in two forms: approximately 60% bound to C4b-binding protein (C4BP) and 40% free. Only free protein S has anticoagulant activity. Conditions that increase C4BP (inflammation, pregnancy, estrogen) reduce free protein S and can mimic or exacerbate deficiency.",
      "technical_details": "Protein S is encoded by PROS1 on chromosome 3q11.1. It contains a Gla domain requiring vitamin K-dependent gamma-carboxylation for calcium binding and membrane interaction. Type I deficiency shows reduced total and free protein S antigen with low functional activity. Type II shows normal antigen but reduced function. Type III shows normal total protein S but reduced free protein S due to increased C4BP binding. Functional assays use clotting-based or chromogenic methods; immunologic assays measure total and free protein S antigen."
