    "title": "Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (HUS)",
    "summary": "Hemolytic uremic syndrome is a thrombotic microangiopathy characterized by the triad of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and acute kidney injury. It is classified as typical (Shiga toxin-producing E. coli, STEC-HUS) or atypical (complement dysregulation, aHUS). Treatment differs substantially: supportive care for typical HUS vs complement inhibition for atypical HUS.",
    "key_points": [
      "Triad: MAHA + thrombocytopenia + AKI (renal predominant vs TTP which is neuro predominant)",
      "Typical HUS (STEC-HUS): 90% of pediatric cases; follows bloody diarrhea; supportive care",
      "Atypical HUS (aHUS): Complement dysregulation; any age; requires eculizumab/ravulizumab",
      "ADAMTS13 activity >10% distinguishes HUS from TTP",
      "Antibiotics in STEC infection may increase HUS risk - avoid if possible",
      "Severe AKI requiring dialysis is common; most recover renal function in typical HUS"
    ],
    "statement": "Hemolytic uremic syndrome is a thrombotic microangiopathy with predominant renal involvement, subdivided into Shiga toxin-mediated (typical) and complement-mediated (atypical) forms with distinct pathophysiology and treatment approaches.",
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "In typical HUS, Shiga toxin from E. coli O157:H7 is absorbed from the gut and targets kidney endothelium (which expresses Gb3 receptor), triggering microthrombi that damage glomeruli. In atypical HUS, uncontrolled complement activation on endothelium causes similar injury but anywhere there's vascular damage.",
      "key_insight": "The key distinction between TTP and HUS is ADAMTS13 activity: <10% = TTP; >10% with prominent renal failure = HUS. Distinguish typical from atypical by clinical context: post-diarrheal in children = typical; recurrent episodes, family history, or adults without prodrome = atypical.",
      "technical_details": "Shiga toxin binds globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) on glomerular endothelium, causing cell death and TMA. Atypical HUS involves mutations in complement regulators (CFH, CFI, MCP, CFB, C3) or autoantibodies to factor H, causing uncontrolled alternative pathway activation."
