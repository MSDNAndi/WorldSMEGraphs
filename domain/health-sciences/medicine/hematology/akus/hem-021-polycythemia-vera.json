    "title": "Polycythemia Vera",
    "summary": "Polycythemia vera (PV) is a BCR-ABL-negative myeloproliferative neoplasm characterized by clonal proliferation of erythroid, myeloid, and megakaryocytic lineages with predominant erythrocytosis. Over 95% of cases harbor the JAK2 V617F mutation or exon 12 mutations, driving constitutive JAK-STAT signaling and erythropoietin-independent erythropoiesis.",
    "key_points": [
      "JAK2 V617F mutation present in >95% of cases; JAK2 exon 12 in remainder",
      "Diagnosis requires elevated hemoglobin/hematocrit plus JAK2 mutation or low EPO with bone marrow findings",
      "Major complications: arterial/venous thrombosis, progression to myelofibrosis or AML",
      "Phlebotomy target: hematocrit <45% (reduces thrombosis by 4-fold)",
      "Low-dose aspirin for all patients without contraindications",
      "Cytoreduction (hydroxyurea, interferon-α, ruxolitinib) for high-risk patients"
    ],
    "statement": "Polycythemia vera is a clonal stem cell disorder driven by constitutive JAK2 activation, presenting with erythrocytosis and significant thrombotic risk that is mitigated by maintaining hematocrit below 45% through phlebotomy and risk-adapted cytoreductive therapy.",
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Think of PV as the bone marrow 'gas pedal' being stuck ON - the JAK2 mutation mimics constant EPO signaling, causing uncontrolled red cell production. The thickened blood increases stroke/clot risk, so we drain excess blood (phlebotomy) to thin it out.",
      "key_insight": "The CYTO-PV trial definitively showed hematocrit <45% target reduces thrombosis compared to 45-50%, establishing the current treatment goal. Low-dose aspirin reduces thrombosis without increasing major bleeding in PV.",
      "technical_details": "JAK2 V617F causes constitutive phosphorylation of STAT5, driving EPO-independent erythroid colony formation. Mutant allele burden correlates with disease phenotype. WHO 2016 criteria lowered hemoglobin thresholds (16.5 g/dL men, 16 g/dL women) to improve sensitivity."
