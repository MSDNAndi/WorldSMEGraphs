    "title": "Liver Disease Coagulopathy",
    "summary": "Liver disease causes complex hemostatic abnormalities due to the liver's central role in synthesizing procoagulant factors (I, II, V, VII, IX, X, XI), anticoagulant proteins (protein C, S, antithrombin), and thrombopoietin. The resulting 'rebalanced hemostasis' means patients are at risk for BOTH bleeding AND thrombosis. Standard coagulation tests (PT, PTT) do not predict bleeding risk. Management requires understanding this balance: avoid overcorrection, treat specific deficiencies only for active bleeding or invasive procedures.",
    "key_points": [
      "Liver synthesizes procoagulant (II, V, VII, IX, X, XI) AND anticoagulant factors (protein C, S, AT)",
      "Factor V is LOW in liver disease (key distinguisher from vitamin K deficiency)",
      "Rebalanced hemostasis: both bleeding AND thrombosis risk",
      "PT/INR does NOT predict bleeding risk in cirrhosis",
      "Thrombocytopenia common (splenic sequestration, low TPO)",
      "Treatment: only for active bleeding or procedures; avoid routine FFP for INR correction"
    ],
    "statement": "Liver disease causes complex coagulopathy affecting all hemostatic pathways with both procoagulant and anticoagulant factor deficiencies, resulting in rebalanced hemostasis where PT/INR does not predict bleeding, and management focuses on treating bleeding rather than laboratory values.",
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "The liver is the 'factory' for almost all clotting proteins - both the accelerators (clotting factors) AND the brakes (anticoagulants). When the factory fails, both systems fail together, creating a new 'balance' that looks abnormal on tests but may not cause excessive bleeding.",
      "key_insight": "A high INR in cirrhosis does NOT mean the patient will bleed. Global hemostasis tests (thrombin generation, TEG/ROTEM) often show normal or even hypercoagulable patterns. Patients with cirrhosis can clot in veins (portal vein thrombosis) despite high INR.",
      "technical_details": "The liver produces factors I, II, V, VII, IX, X, XI, XIII and anticoagulants protein C, protein S, and antithrombin. Reduced factor levels are matched by reduced anticoagulant levels, maintaining hemostatic balance. Thrombopoietin (TPO) produced by liver is reduced, contributing to thrombocytopenia. Von Willebrand factor and factor VIII are elevated in cirrhosis (produced by endothelium)."
