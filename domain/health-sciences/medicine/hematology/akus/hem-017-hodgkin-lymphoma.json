    "title": "Hodgkin Lymphoma",
    "summary": "Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) is a B-cell lymphoma characterized by the presence of Reed-Sternberg cells (large binucleated cells with prominent nucleoli, 'owl's eye' appearance) in a reactive inflammatory background. It typically presents in young adults with painless lymphadenopathy and is one of the most curable cancers, with >85% long-term survival using ABVD chemotherapy and/or radiation.",
    "key_points": [
      "Reed-Sternberg cells are diagnostic but comprise <1% of tumor mass",
      "Bimodal age distribution: peak 15-35 and >55 years",
      "Presents with painless lymphadenopathy, often cervical/mediastinal",
      "B symptoms (fever, night sweats, weight loss) have prognostic significance",
      "ABVD (doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, dacarbazine) is standard therapy",
      "PET-adapted therapy reduces treatment in early-stage disease"
    ],
    "statement": "Hodgkin lymphoma is a highly curable B-cell lymphoma defined by Reed-Sternberg cells in an inflammatory milieu, staged by Ann Arbor system, and treated with chemotherapy ± radiation therapy with excellent cure rates.",
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "HL is like finding a criminal (Reed-Sternberg cell) hiding in a crowd (inflammatory infiltrate). The criminal is rare (<1% of cells) but the whole crowd is the tumor. The inflammatory cells aren't innocent bystanders - they're recruited by the RS cells and help them survive. Killing the criminal (RS cell) disperses the crowd and cures the disease.",
      "key_insight": "Unlike most cancers, the neoplastic cells (RS cells) are rare and the tumor mass is mostly reactive immune cells. RS cells evade immune destruction by expressing PD-L1 and secreting immunosuppressive cytokines. This makes HL highly sensitive to checkpoint inhibitors.",
      "technical_details": "Classic HL RS cells are CD15+, CD30+, PAX5 weak, CD20-, CD45-. They arise from germinal center B cells that have undergone 'crippling mutations' in immunoglobulin genes but escape apoptosis through NF-κB activation, often driven by EBV (30-40% of cases). Nodular lymphocyte-predominant HL (NLPHL) has different biology (CD20+ 'popcorn cells')."
