    "title": "Primary Myelofibrosis",
    "summary": "Primary myelofibrosis (PMF) is a BCR-ABL-negative myeloproliferative neoplasm characterized by clonal myeloproliferation, reactive bone marrow fibrosis, extramedullary hematopoiesis (splenomegaly), and constitutional symptoms. It carries the worst prognosis among classical MPNs with median survival of 3-7 years depending on risk category.",
    "key_points": [
      "Driver mutations: JAK2 V617F (~60%), CALR (~25%), MPL (~5%), triple-negative (~10%)",
      "Hallmark findings: bone marrow fibrosis, leukoerythroblastic blood smear, splenomegaly",
      "Two phases: prefibrotic (hypercellular, no fibrosis) and overt fibrotic PMF",
      "Risk stratification: DIPSS/DIPSS-Plus/MIPSS70 guides treatment decisions",
      "Only curative therapy: allogeneic stem cell transplant for eligible high-risk patients",
      "Ruxolitinib improves splenomegaly and symptoms but doesn't alter disease course"
    ],
    "statement": "Primary myelofibrosis is a progressive clonal stem cell disorder characterized by marrow fibrosis, extramedullary hematopoiesis, and constitutional symptoms, requiring risk-stratified management with allogeneic transplant offering the only curative option for eligible patients.",
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Think of PMF as the bone marrow becoming 'scarred' - clonal megakaryocytes release fibrogenic cytokines (TGF-β, PDGF) that trigger fibroblasts to deposit collagen. As the marrow scars over, blood production moves to spleen and liver (extramedullary hematopoiesis), causing massive organ enlargement.",
      "key_insight": "The fibrosis is REACTIVE, not clonal - it's a response to abnormal cytokine release from clonal cells. This is why anti-fibrotic agents alone don't work; you must target the underlying clone. Transplant replaces the clone; JAK inhibitors suppress it.",
      "technical_details": "Leukoerythroblastic smear (nucleated RBCs, immature myeloid cells, teardrop cells) reflects extramedullary hematopoiesis and marrow stress. High-risk mutations (ASXL1, SRSF2, EZH2, IDH1/2, U2AF1) worsen prognosis independent of clinical risk scores."
