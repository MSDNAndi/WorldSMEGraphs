    "title": "Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma",
    "summary": "Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) encompasses a heterogeneous group of lymphoid malignancies arising from B cells (85%), T cells (15%), or NK cells (<1%). Unlike Hodgkin lymphoma, NHL lacks Reed-Sternberg cells and tends to spread noncontiguously. NHL ranges from indolent (follicular lymphoma) to highly aggressive (Burkitt lymphoma), with treatment and prognosis varying dramatically by subtype.",
    "key_points": [
      "Heterogeneous group of >60 distinct lymphoma subtypes",
      "B-cell NHL (85%): DLBCL most common aggressive; follicular most common indolent",
      "T-cell NHL (15%): generally more aggressive with poorer outcomes",
      "Spreads noncontiguously (unlike HL); often presents in advanced stage",
      "R-CHOP is standard for DLBCL; watch-and-wait for asymptomatic indolent NHL",
      "Many novel therapies: CAR-T, bispecifics, targeted agents"
    ],
    "statement": "Non-Hodgkin lymphoma is a diverse group of lymphoid neoplasms arising predominantly from B cells, classified by cell of origin and clinical behavior (indolent vs aggressive), with treatment ranging from observation to intensive chemoimmunotherapy or CAR-T cell therapy.",
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "NHL is like a family of diseases rather than one disease - from slowly growing 'weeds' (indolent lymphomas) that may not need treatment, to rapidly spreading 'wildfires' (aggressive lymphomas) requiring urgent treatment. Paradoxically, some indolent lymphomas are incurable but patients live decades, while aggressive lymphomas are often curable with intensive therapy.",
      "key_insight": "The indolent-aggressive distinction is critical: Indolent lymphomas (follicular, marginal zone) are rarely curable but compatible with long survival; aggressive lymphomas (DLBCL, Burkitt) are rapidly fatal if untreated but often curable with chemotherapy. Treatment approach is completely different.",
      "technical_details": "WHO classification is based on morphology, immunophenotype, genetics, and clinical features. DLBCL is classified by cell-of-origin (germinal center B-cell vs activated B-cell) with different prognosis and emerging targeted therapies. Follicular lymphoma has t(14;18) BCL2 translocation. Burkitt has t(8;14) MYC translocation with 100% proliferation rate."
