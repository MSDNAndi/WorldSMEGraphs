    "title": "Protein C Deficiency",
    "summary": "Protein C deficiency is an inherited thrombophilia causing 5-10× increased VTE risk. Protein C is a vitamin K-dependent natural anticoagulant that, when activated by thrombomodulin-thrombin complex, inactivates factors Va and VIIIa. The hallmark complication is warfarin-induced skin necrosis, which occurs because warfarin reduces protein C (short half-life ~8 hours) faster than procoagulant factors, creating transient hypercoagulability. Prevention requires bridging with heparin when starting warfarin. Homozygous deficiency causes neonatal purpura fulminans.",
    "key_points": [
      "Vitamin K-dependent anticoagulant; inactivates Va and VIIIa",
      "Protein C has SHORT half-life (~8 hours) - drops before factors II, X",

    "statement": "Protein C deficiency is an inherited thrombophilia with VTE risk and characteristic warfarin-induced skin necrosis due to rapid depletion of anticoagulant protein C before procoagulant factors, requiring heparin bridging when initiating warfarin therapy.",
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Protein C is like a 'brake pedal' on the clotting cascade. When you start warfarin, the brake pedal (protein C) wears out faster than the 'accelerator' (factor II). For a few days, you're driving with a broken brake - this transient hypercoagulability can cause skin necrosis.",
      "key_insight": "Warfarin skin necrosis is the board exam favorite. Protein C half-life is ~8 hours vs factor II's ~60 hours. When warfarin starts, protein C drops rapidly, creating a hypercoagulable state until factor II finally falls. This is why heparin bridging is mandatory.",
      "technical_details": "Protein C is activated by thrombin bound to thrombomodulin on endothelium. Activated protein C (APC) cleaves and inactivates factors Va and VIIIa, using protein S as cofactor. APC also has anti-inflammatory and cytoprotective effects. PROC gene mutations cause quantitative (type I) or qualitative (type II) deficiency."
