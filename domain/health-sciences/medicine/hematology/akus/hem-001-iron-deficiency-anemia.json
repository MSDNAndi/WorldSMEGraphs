    "title": "Iron Deficiency Anemia",
    "summary": "Iron deficiency anemia (IDA) is the most common cause of anemia worldwide, affecting ~2 billion people. It results from inadequate iron for hemoglobin synthesis, causing microcytic hypochromic anemia. Diagnosis requires identifying iron deficiency (low ferritin, low serum iron, high TIBC, low transferrin saturation) AND determining the underlying cause (blood loss, malabsorption, inadequate intake).",
    "key_points": [
      "Most common anemia worldwide; most common cause of microcytic anemia",
      "Classic labs: Low ferritin (most specific), low serum iron, high TIBC, low transferrin saturation",
      "Always identify the CAUSE - GI blood loss in adults until proven otherwise",
      "RBC morphology: microcytic (low MCV), hypochromic (low MCHC), anisocytosis (high RDW)",
      "Treatment: Iron replacement (oral preferred) AND treat underlying cause",
      "Response: Reticulocyte increase in 1-2 weeks; Hgb rise 1-2 g/dL in 4 weeks"
    ],
    "statement": "Iron deficiency anemia is characterized by inadequate iron for hemoglobin synthesis causing microcytic hypochromic anemia, diagnosed by low ferritin with iron studies confirming deficiency, and managed by identifying and treating the underlying cause while providing iron replacement therapy.",
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Iron is the central atom in hemoglobin that carries oxygen. Without iron, the body makes fewer and smaller red blood cells. Think of a factory running out of a key raw material - production slows and the product is smaller.",
      "key_insight": "Iron deficiency is a SYMPTOM, not a diagnosis. In men and postmenopausal women, assume GI blood loss (cancer, ulcer, angiodysplasia) until proven otherwise. A new diagnosis of IDA in these populations requires GI evaluation.",
      "technical_details": "Iron is absorbed in the duodenum; absorption enhanced by acid, vitamin C. Ferritin is the storage form; serum ferritin <30 ng/mL is diagnostic of iron deficiency. In inflammation, ferritin rises as acute phase reactant - use transferrin saturation <20% as alternative marker."
