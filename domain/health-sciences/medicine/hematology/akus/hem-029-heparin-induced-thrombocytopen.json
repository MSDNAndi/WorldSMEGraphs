    "title": "Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT)",
    "summary": "HIT is an immune-mediated, prothrombotic disorder caused by antibodies against complexes of platelet factor 4 (PF4) and heparin. Despite thrombocytopenia, the predominant complication is thrombosis (not bleeding). HIT typically occurs 5-10 days after heparin initiation and requires immediate cessation of all heparin products and initiation of alternative anticoagulation.",
    "key_points": [
      "Immune-mediated: antibodies to PF4-heparin complexes activate platelets → thrombosis",
      "Timing: typically days 5-10 of heparin exposure; can be earlier with recent exposure",
      "Platelet drop: usually >50% from baseline; rarely <20,000",
      "Paradoxical THROMBOSIS predominates, not bleeding (30-50% develop thrombosis)",
      "4Ts score: pretest probability for HIT (Thrombocytopenia, Timing, Thrombosis, oTher causes)",
      "Management: STOP all heparin; start alternative anticoagulant (argatroban, bivalirudin, fondaparinux)"
    ],
    "statement": "Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia is a prothrombotic immune disorder caused by anti-PF4/heparin antibodies that paradoxically causes thrombosis rather than bleeding, requiring immediate heparin cessation and alternative anticoagulation to prevent potentially devastating venous and arterial thrombotic complications.",
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "HIT antibodies don't just destroy platelets - they ACTIVATE them. Activated platelets release procoagulant microparticles and aggregate, triggering thrombosis everywhere. Despite low platelet counts, patients are in a hypercoagulable state. Stop the heparin AND anticoagulate with something else.",
      "key_insight": "HIT is a clinical diagnosis that doesn't wait for lab confirmation. A dropping platelet count 5-10 days into heparin therapy = presume HIT until proven otherwise. The 4Ts score helps stratify risk, but a high clinical suspicion mandates action immediately.",
      "technical_details": "Anti-PF4/heparin IgG antibodies bind platelet FcγRIIa receptors, causing platelet activation, aggregation, and release of procoagulant microparticles. Monocyte and endothelial activation also occurs. ELISA detects anti-PF4 antibodies (sensitive but not specific); serotonin release assay (SRA) or heparin-induced platelet activation (HIPA) confirms functional HIT antibodies."
