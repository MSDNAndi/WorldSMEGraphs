    "title": "Hemophilia B (Christmas Disease)",
    "summary": "Hemophilia B (Christmas disease) is an X-linked recessive bleeding disorder caused by deficiency of coagulation factor IX (FIX). Named after Stephen Christmas, the first patient described with this condition, it accounts for ~15-20% of hemophilia cases. Clinical manifestations are indistinguishable from hemophilia A: spontaneous hemarthroses, deep muscle hematomas, and prolonged bleeding after surgery or trauma. Severity correlates with FIX activity levels. Treatment involves FIX replacement therapy, with newer extended half-life products and gene therapy offering improved options.",
    "key_points": [
      "X-linked recessive; FIX deficiency; 15-20% of hemophilia cases",
      "Clinically identical to hemophilia A - hemarthroses, muscle bleeds, surgical bleeding",
      "Severity: Severe (<1% FIX), Moderate (1-5% FIX), Mild (5-40% FIX)",
      "Labs: Prolonged PTT, normal PT, normal platelet count, low FIX activity",
      "Treatment: FIX concentrate (plasma-derived or recombinant); extended half-life products available",

    "statement": "Hemophilia B is an X-linked recessive bleeding disorder caused by factor IX deficiency, presenting with hemarthroses, muscle bleeds, and prolonged bleeding, diagnosed by prolonged PTT and low FIX activity, and managed with FIX replacement therapy or gene therapy.",
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Factor IX is essential for the intrinsic pathway of coagulation. Without it, the clotting cascade cannot proceed efficiently, leading to bleeding especially into joints and muscles. Think of it as a missing link in a chain reaction - the chain breaks down at that point.",
      "key_insight": "Hemophilia B is clinically indistinguishable from hemophilia A - you cannot tell them apart by symptoms. The only way to differentiate is by measuring specific factor levels (FVIII vs FIX). This is critical for treatment selection.",
      "technical_details": "FIX is a vitamin K-dependent serine protease synthesized in the liver. It is activated by FXIa in the intrinsic pathway or by the tissue factor-FVIIa complex. Activated FIX (FIXa) forms the tenase complex with FVIIIa on phospholipid surfaces to activate FX. FIX gene (F9) is located on Xq27.1; mutations include point mutations, deletions, and insertions. Half-life of FIX is ~18-24 hours (longer than FVIII)."
