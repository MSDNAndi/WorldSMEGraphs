    "title": "von Willebrand Disease",
    "summary": "von Willebrand disease (VWD) is the most common inherited bleeding disorder, affecting ~1% of the population. It results from quantitative or qualitative defects in von Willebrand factor (VWF), a glycoprotein essential for platelet adhesion and FVIII carrier function. VWD presents with mucocutaneous bleeding (epistaxis, menorrhagia, easy bruising) rather than the deep bleeding seen in hemophilia. Three major types exist based on VWF deficiency pattern. Treatment includes desmopressin (DDAVP) for mild cases and VWF-containing concentrates for severe disease.",
    "key_points": [
      "Most common inherited bleeding disorder (~1% prevalence)",
      "VWF has dual function: platelet adhesion AND FVIII carrier/stabilizer",
      "Mucocutaneous bleeding pattern: epistaxis, menorrhagia, bruising, GI bleeding",
      "Types: Type 1 (partial deficiency), Type 2 (qualitative defects), Type 3 (complete absence)",
      "Labs: Low VWF antigen, low VWF activity (ristocetin cofactor), ± low FVIII",
      "Treatment: DDAVP (releases VWF stores) for type 1; VWF concentrate for type 3"
    ],
    "statement": "von Willebrand disease is the most common inherited bleeding disorder caused by VWF deficiency or dysfunction, presenting with mucocutaneous bleeding, diagnosed by VWF antigen and activity assays, and managed with DDAVP or VWF-containing concentrates.",
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "VWF is like molecular 'glue' that helps platelets stick to damaged vessel walls AND acts as a 'bodyguard' protecting factor VIII from degradation. Without VWF, platelets can't stick properly and FVIII gets broken down faster - causing both platelet-type and factor-type bleeding.",
      "key_insight": "The bleeding pattern in VWD is mucocutaneous (skin and mucosa) because VWF is critical for platelet function. This differs from hemophilia which causes deep bleeding (joints, muscles) due to coagulation factor deficiency. If a patient has nosebleeds and heavy periods, think VWD; if they have hemarthroses, think hemophilia.",
      "technical_details": "VWF is synthesized in endothelial cells and megakaryocytes; stored in Weibel-Palade bodies and platelet α-granules. VWF multimers bind platelet GPIb and collagen to mediate adhesion. VWF binds and stabilizes FVIII, extending its half-life from minutes to 12 hours. The VWF gene is on chromosome 12."
