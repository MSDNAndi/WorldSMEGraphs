    "title": "Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia",
    "summary": "Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a malignant clonal proliferation of lymphoid precursors (lymphoblasts) in bone marrow, blood, and extramedullary sites. It is the most common childhood malignancy with >90% cure rates in pediatric patients but remains challenging in adults. Prognosis depends heavily on cytogenetics, with Philadelphia chromosome (BCR-ABL1) historically conferring poor prognosis but now improved with TKI therapy.",
    "key_points": [
      "Most common childhood cancer; peak incidence age 2-5 years",
      "Presents with pancytopenia, bone pain, lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly",
      "B-ALL (85%) vs T-ALL (15%); requires immunophenotyping",

    ],
    "statement": "Acute lymphoblastic leukemia is a hematologic malignancy arising from lymphoid precursors, highly curable in children with multi-agent chemotherapy including CNS prophylaxis, with risk stratification based on cytogenetics and minimal residual disease response.",
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "ALL is like a factory mutiny where the apprentice workers (lymphoid precursors) never graduate to become skilled workers (mature lymphocytes). Instead, they multiply uncontrollably, crowd out normal workers, and shut down production. Treatment requires intense 're-education' (chemotherapy) over 2-3 years.",
      "key_insight": "The dramatic difference in cure rates between children (>90%) and adults (~40-50%) relates to disease biology, chemotherapy tolerance, and higher rates of adverse cytogenetics in adults. Using pediatric-inspired regimens in younger adults has improved outcomes.",
      "technical_details": "ALL requires ≥20% lymphoblasts in marrow. Immunophenotyping distinguishes B-ALL (CD19+, CD22+, CD79a+) from T-ALL (CD3+, CD7+, TdT+). Recurrent genetic abnormalities stratify risk: t(12;21) ETV6-RUNX1 is favorable; t(9;22) BCR-ABL1 and MLL rearrangements are adverse in adults. Minimal residual disease (MRD) negativity predicts excellent outcomes."
