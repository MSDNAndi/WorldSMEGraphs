    "title": "G6PD Deficiency",
    "summary": "Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency is the most common human enzyme defect, affecting over 400 million people worldwide. This X-linked disorder renders RBCs vulnerable to oxidative stress by impairing glutathione regeneration. Hemolysis occurs episodically upon exposure to oxidative triggers (infections, fava beans, certain drugs) rather than chronically.",
    "key_points": [
      "Most common enzyme deficiency worldwide; X-linked recessive",
      "Episodic hemolysis triggered by oxidative stress (drugs, infections, fava beans)",
      "Bite cells and Heinz bodies on peripheral smear",
      "G6PD levels may be falsely normal during acute hemolysis - retest in 2-3 months",
      "Treatment is avoidance of triggers; no specific therapy",
      "Confers partial protection against severe malaria"
    ],
    "statement": "G6PD deficiency is an X-linked disorder of the hexose monophosphate shunt that impairs RBC antioxidant defense, causing episodic intravascular hemolysis upon exposure to oxidative stressors, diagnosed by enzyme assay and managed by trigger avoidance.",
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "G6PD is like the fire extinguisher in RBCs - it generates NADPH to refill the glutathione 'extinguisher' that neutralizes oxidative 'fires.' Without enough G6PD, oxidative stress from drugs, infections, or foods overwhelms the RBC, causing hemoglobin to denature (Heinz bodies) and the cell to rupture.",
      "key_insight": "During acute hemolysis, younger RBCs (with higher G6PD activity) survive while older, G6PD-depleted RBCs lyse. This enriches the circulation with young RBCs, causing falsely normal G6PD assay during crisis - always retest 2-3 months after hemolytic episode.",
      "technical_details": "G6PD catalyzes the first step of the hexose monophosphate shunt: Glucose-6-phosphate → 6-phosphogluconolactone, generating NADPH. NADPH is essential for glutathione reductase to regenerate reduced glutathione (GSH), which detoxifies hydrogen peroxide and other oxidants. Over 200 G6PD variants exist, with different degrees of enzyme instability and clinical severity."
