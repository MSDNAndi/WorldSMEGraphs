    "title": "Autoimmune Hemolytic Anemia",
    "summary": "Autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) is an acquired hemolytic anemia caused by autoantibodies directed against red blood cell surface antigens. It is classified as warm (IgG-mediated, extravascular hemolysis) or cold (IgM-mediated, complement-dependent hemolysis). The direct antiglobulin (Coombs) test is diagnostic, and treatment depends on the antibody type.",
    "key_points": [
      "Direct Coombs test (DAT) positive is diagnostic",
      "Warm AIHA: IgG antibodies, extravascular hemolysis, treat with steroids",
      "Cold AIHA: IgM antibodies, complement-mediated, cold avoidance first-line",
      "May be idiopathic or secondary to lymphoproliferative disorders, infections, or drugs",
      "Spherocytes on peripheral smear (RBCs lose membrane in spleen)",
      "Avoid packed RBC transfusion unless life-threatening; use extended crossmatch"
    ],
    "statement": "Autoimmune hemolytic anemia is characterized by production of autoantibodies against red blood cells, causing premature RBC destruction, diagnosed by positive direct Coombs test, and classified by thermal reactivity of the antibody which determines treatment approach.",
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "In AIHA, the immune system mistakes RBCs as foreign and tags them for destruction. Warm antibodies (IgG) work best at body temperature and tag RBCs for splenic macrophages. Cold antibodies (IgM) activate complement at low temperatures, causing intravascular hemolysis when blood flows through cool extremities.",
      "key_insight": "The thermal amplitude of the antibody determines clinical presentation and treatment: Warm AIHA responds to immunosuppression (steroids, rituximab); Cold AIHA requires cold avoidance and may respond to complement inhibitors or anti-CD20 therapy but NOT steroids.",
      "technical_details": "Warm AIHA: IgG binds RBCs at 37°C; Fc portion recognized by splenic macrophages leading to phagocytosis or partial membrane loss (spherocyte formation). Cold agglutinin disease: IgM binds at <37°C, fixes complement (C3b); cells either undergo intravascular lysis or are cleared by hepatic macrophages. Paroxysmal cold hemoglobinuria: IgG Donath-Landsteiner antibody binds at cold temperatures, lyses at warm temperatures."
