    "title": "Aplastic Anemia",
    "summary": "Aplastic anemia (AA) is a rare, potentially life-threatening bone marrow failure syndrome characterized by peripheral pancytopenia and hypocellular bone marrow. Most cases are acquired and immune-mediated, with oligoclonal T-cell destruction of hematopoietic stem cells. Treatment depends on severity and age, with immunosuppressive therapy or allogeneic stem cell transplantation as primary options.",
    "key_points": [
      "Pancytopenia with hypocellular (<25% cellularity) bone marrow",
      "Acquired (immune-mediated) in 70-80%; inherited syndromes in remainder",
      "No splenomegaly - spleen is normal (unlike MDS or leukemia infiltration)",
      "Severe AA: ANC <500, platelets <20K, reticulocytes <20K",
      "Treatment: Immunosuppression (ATG + cyclosporine) or HSCT for young patients",
      "10-15% risk of clonal evolution to MDS or PNH"
    ],
    "statement": "Aplastic anemia is an immune-mediated bone marrow failure syndrome causing pancytopenia with fatty hypocellular marrow, diagnosed by bone marrow biopsy, and treated with immunosuppressive therapy or stem cell transplantation depending on severity and patient age.",
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Imagine bone marrow as a garden. In aplastic anemia, the gardener's own immune system (T cells) attacks the seeds (stem cells), killing them. The garden becomes empty (hypocellular) and produces no vegetables (blood cells). Treatment either calms the rogue gardener (immunosuppression) or plants new seeds from a donor (transplant).",
      "key_insight": "Unlike leukemia where the marrow is packed with abnormal cells, aplastic anemia marrow is empty (hypocellular). This distinction is critical - aspirate may be 'dry tap' but biopsy shows fat replacing hematopoietic tissue.",
      "technical_details": "Pathogenic T cells (oligoclonal, Th1 type) produce IFN-γ and TNF-α that suppress hematopoiesis. These cells target autoantigens on hematopoietic stem cells. HLA-DR15 is overrepresented in AA patients. Telomere shortening in ~30% suggests underlying genetic predisposition even in 'acquired' cases."
