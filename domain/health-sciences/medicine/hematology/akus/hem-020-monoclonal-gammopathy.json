    "title": "Monoclonal Gammopathy of Undetermined Significance (MGUS)",
    "summary": "MGUS is a premalignant plasma cell disorder characterized by the presence of a monoclonal immunoglobulin (M-protein) in the serum without evidence of multiple myeloma, Waldenström macroglobulinemia, or other B-cell lymphoproliferative disorders. It carries an approximately 1% per year risk of progression to malignancy and requires ongoing surveillance.",
    "key_points": [
      "Defined by M-protein <3 g/dL, bone marrow plasma cells <10%, no CRAB criteria",
      "Overall 1% per year risk of progression to multiple myeloma or related disorder",
      "Three subtypes: IgG, IgM, and light-chain MGUS with different progression profiles",
      "Risk stratification uses M-protein level, type, and free light chain ratio",
      "Mayo Clinic model predicts 20-year progression risk: 5% (low) to 58% (high)",
      "No treatment indicated; surveillance with SPEP every 6-12 months"
    ],
    "statement": "MGUS represents the earliest identifiable stage in the clonal plasma cell disease spectrum, serving as the precursor to multiple myeloma and related disorders while requiring careful risk stratification to guide surveillance intensity.",
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Think of MGUS as a 'speed limit violation' by plasma cells - they're producing too much of one specific antibody type, but they're not yet causing damage. Like monitoring a pre-diabetic patient, we watch for progression to overt disease.",
      "key_insight": "The key distinction from multiple myeloma is the absence of CRAB criteria (Calcium elevation, Renal insufficiency, Anemia, Bone lesions) and myeloma-defining events. The transition from MGUS to myeloma involves accumulation of genetic hits driving clonal expansion.",
      "technical_details": "M-protein quantification uses serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP) with immunofixation for typing. Free light chain (FLC) ratio abnormality indicates higher risk. Bone marrow biopsy confirms <10% clonal plasma cells. PET-CT or MRI helps exclude occult bone lesions."
