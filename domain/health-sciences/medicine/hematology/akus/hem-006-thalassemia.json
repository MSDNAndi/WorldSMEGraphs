    "title": "Thalassemia",
    "summary": "Thalassemias are inherited hemoglobinopathies characterized by reduced or absent production of one or more globin chains, resulting in ineffective erythropoiesis and hemolysis. Alpha-thalassemia results from deletion/mutation of α-globin genes, while beta-thalassemia involves mutations in β-globin genes. The hallmark is microcytic hypochromic anemia with normal iron stores.",

      "Quantitative defect in globin chain production (vs qualitative in sickle cell)",
      "Microcytic hypochromic anemia with NORMAL or elevated iron stores",
      "Alpha-thalassemia: gene deletion model (4 genes, increasing severity)",

      "Target cells, basophilic stippling on peripheral smear",
      "Transfusion dependence in severe forms leads to iron overload"
    ],
    "statement": "Thalassemias are inherited disorders of globin chain synthesis causing microcytic hypochromic anemia from ineffective erythropoiesis and hemolysis, distinguished from iron deficiency by normal iron stores and elevated RBC count relative to hemoglobin.",
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Think of hemoglobin as a 4-person team that needs equal members. In thalassemia, one type of chain is underproduced, so excess chains precipitate and damage the RBC. It's like building cars when one assembly line (α or β chain) runs slow - the other parts pile up and damage the factory.",
      "key_insight": "The RBC count is often normal or high relative to the hemoglobin level (Mentzer index <13) because the body tries to compensate by making more RBCs, unlike iron deficiency where production is simply limited.",
      "technical_details": "Alpha-thalassemia: 4 α-globin genes (2 per chromosome 16). Deletions cause progressively severe disease (1 gene: silent carrier → 4 genes: hydrops fetalis). Beta-thalassemia: 2 β-globin genes (1 per chromosome 11). Mutations classified as β+ (reduced) or β0 (absent) production."
