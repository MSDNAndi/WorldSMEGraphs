    "summary": "Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are clonal hematopoietic stem cell disorders characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis, morphologic dysplasia, cytopenias, and risk of transformation to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). MDS primarily affects elderly patients and carries variable prognosis stratified by the IPSS-R scoring system based on cytogenetics, blasts, and cytopenias.",
    "key_points": [
      "Clonal stem cell disorder with dysplastic hematopoiesis",
      "Cytopenias despite hypercellular marrow (ineffective hematopoiesis)",
      "15-30% risk of AML transformation depending on subtype",
      "IPSS-R scoring stratifies risk and guides treatment decisions",
      "Hypomethylating agents (azacitidine, decitabine) are backbone of therapy",

    ],
    "statement": "Myelodysplastic syndromes are clonal neoplasms arising from hematopoietic stem cells, characterized by cytopenia(s), morphologic dysplasia, and risk of leukemic transformation, with treatment stratified by prognostic risk category.",
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "MDS is like a factory (bone marrow) that's working overtime but producing defective products (dysplastic cells) that get discarded (ineffective hematopoiesis). The factory may eventually stop making normal products altogether and start making cancer cells (AML transformation).",
      "key_insight": "The paradox of MDS: The marrow is usually hypercellular (working hard) but blood counts are low (products are defective). This 'ineffective hematopoiesis' distinguishes MDS from aplastic anemia (hypocellular marrow) and from leukemia (marrow works, just makes blasts).",
      "technical_details": "MDS arises from accumulation of genetic and epigenetic mutations in HSCs. Common mutations include splicing factors (SF3B1, SRSF2, U2AF1), epigenetic regulators (TET2, DNMT3A, ASXL1), and signaling molecules (NRAS, JAK2). del(5q) is associated with lenalidomide response. Complex karyotype and TP53 mutations confer poor prognosis."
