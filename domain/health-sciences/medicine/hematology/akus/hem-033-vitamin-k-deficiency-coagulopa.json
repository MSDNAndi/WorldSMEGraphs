    "title": "Vitamin K Deficiency Coagulopathy",
    "summary": "Vitamin K deficiency causes coagulopathy by impairing synthesis of functional vitamin K-dependent clotting factors (II, VII, IX, X) and anticoagulant proteins (protein C, S). Vitamin K is required for γ-carboxylation of glutamic acid residues, enabling these factors to bind calcium and phospholipid surfaces. Causes include dietary deficiency, malabsorption, antibiotic suppression of gut flora, and warfarin therapy. Laboratory findings show prolonged PT (first), then PTT; treatment is vitamin K replacement, with urgency determining route and concurrent FFP/PCC for active bleeding.",
    "key_points": [
      "Vitamin K-dependent factors: II, VII, IX, X, protein C, protein S",
      "PT prolonged first (factor VII has shortest half-life ~6 hours)",
      "Common causes: malabsorption, antibiotics, dietary deficiency, warfarin",
      "Newborns at risk: hemorrhagic disease of the newborn (VKDB)",
      "Treatment: Vitamin K (oral, IV, or IM); FFP or PCC for urgent reversal",
      "PT corrects within 12-24 hours with vitamin K; faster with FFP/PCC"
    ],
    "statement": "Vitamin K deficiency coagulopathy results from inadequate γ-carboxylation of vitamin K-dependent factors (II, VII, IX, X, proteins C and S), presenting with prolonged PT before PTT, and treated with vitamin K replacement and blood products for active bleeding.",
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Vitamin K acts like a 'finishing step' in making clotting factors work. Without it, the liver produces non-functional factors that can't bind calcium properly. Factor VII dies first (shortest half-life), so PT rises before PTT.",
      "key_insight": "The sequence matters: PT prolonged BEFORE PTT because factor VII (extrinsic pathway, measured by PT) has the shortest half-life (~6 hours). Factor II has the longest half-life (~60 hours). This temporal pattern helps distinguish vitamin K deficiency from liver disease.",
      "technical_details": "Vitamin K is a cofactor for γ-glutamyl carboxylase, which converts glutamic acid residues to γ-carboxyglutamic acid (Gla) on vitamin K-dependent proteins. Gla residues are essential for calcium binding and phospholipid surface interaction. Vitamin K epoxide reductase (VKORC1) recycles vitamin K; warfarin inhibits VKORC1."
