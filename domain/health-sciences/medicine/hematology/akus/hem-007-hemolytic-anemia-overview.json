    "title": "Hemolytic Anemia Overview",
    "summary": "Hemolytic anemias are characterized by premature destruction of red blood cells (hemolysis) faster than bone marrow can compensate. They are classified by mechanism (intrinsic vs extrinsic), location (intravascular vs extravascular), and etiology (inherited vs acquired). Key diagnostic features include reticulocytosis, elevated LDH and indirect bilirubin, decreased haptoglobin, and specific smear findings.",
    "key_points": [
      "Hallmark: Reticulocytosis (bone marrow compensation attempt)",
      "Intravascular hemolysis: Free Hb, hemoglobinuria, low haptoglobin",
      "Extravascular hemolysis: Splenomegaly, jaundice, gallstones",
      "Intrinsic defects: Membrane (spherocytosis), enzyme (G6PD), hemoglobin (sickle cell)",
      "Extrinsic causes: Immune (AIHA), mechanical (MAHA), infectious (malaria)",
      "LDH elevated, indirect bilirubin elevated, haptoglobin low/absent"
    ],
    "statement": "Hemolytic anemia results from accelerated red blood cell destruction exceeding bone marrow compensatory capacity, diagnosed by reticulocytosis and hemolysis markers, with classification and treatment determined by the underlying mechanism.",
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Think of RBCs as cars with a 120-day warranty. In hemolytic anemia, cars are being totaled before their time - either due to manufacturing defects (intrinsic) or road hazards (extrinsic). The factory (bone marrow) works overtime, producing young cars (reticulocytes) to compensate.",
      "key_insight": "The distinction between intravascular and extravascular hemolysis is crucial: Intravascular releases free hemoglobin into blood (hemoglobinuria, low haptoglobin), while extravascular occurs in spleen/liver (splenomegaly, jaundice). This distinction guides diagnosis and management.",
      "technical_details": "Haptoglobin irreversibly binds free hemoglobin and is consumed in intravascular hemolysis. LDH is released from lysed RBCs. Unconjugated bilirubin rises from heme catabolism. Reticulocyte production index >2 indicates appropriate marrow response."
