    "title": "Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia",
    "summary": "Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is the most common adult leukemia in Western countries, characterized by clonal proliferation of mature-appearing but immunologically dysfunctional B lymphocytes. Many patients are asymptomatic and require only observation, while others develop progressive disease requiring treatment. Novel targeted therapies (BTK inhibitors, BCL-2 inhibitors) have transformed management.",
    "key_points": [
      "Most common adult leukemia in Western countries; median age 72",
      "Mature-appearing CD5+/CD23+ B lymphocytes on peripheral smear",
      "'Watch and wait' for early-stage asymptomatic disease",
      "Rai/Binet staging; IGHV mutation status is key prognostic factor",
      "BTK inhibitors (ibrutinib, acalabrutinib) and venetoclax are first-line",

    ],
    "statement": "Chronic lymphocytic leukemia is an indolent B-cell neoplasm characterized by accumulation of mature-appearing lymphocytes, managed with observation in early stages and targeted therapies (BTK inhibitors, venetoclax) in progressive disease.",
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "CLL cells are like immortal soldiers that forgot how to fight - they live longer than normal B cells (failed apoptosis) but don't function properly (immunodeficiency). They accumulate slowly like water filling a bathtub, eventually crowding out normal cells. Many patients live decades with the 'bathtub' only half-full, never needing treatment.",
      "key_insight": "Unlike most cancers where early treatment is better, CLL is often watched without treatment for years. Treatment is indicated only for progressive or symptomatic disease. IGHV mutated (good prognosis) vs unmutated (poor prognosis) CLL have fundamentally different biology and outcomes.",
      "technical_details": "CLL cells express CD5 (normally a T-cell marker), CD19, CD20 (dim), CD23, and surface immunoglobulin (dim). IGHV somatic hypermutation status reflects post-germinal center origin (mutated, better prognosis) vs pre-germinal center (unmutated, worse prognosis). Del(13q) is most common and favorable; del(17p) and TP53 mutation confer poor prognosis."
