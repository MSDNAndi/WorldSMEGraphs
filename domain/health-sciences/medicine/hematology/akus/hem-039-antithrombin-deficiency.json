    "title": "Antithrombin Deficiency",
    "summary": "Antithrombin (AT, formerly antithrombin III) deficiency is an inherited thrombophilia with the highest VTE risk among the natural anticoagulant deficiencies (10-25× increased). Antithrombin is the major inhibitor of thrombin and factor Xa, and its activity is markedly potentiated by heparin. AT deficiency causes heparin resistance - the hallmark clinical clue. Acquired causes include liver disease, DIC, nephrotic syndrome, and heparin therapy. Treatment of acute VTE may require antithrombin concentrate to achieve therapeutic anticoagulation.",
    "key_points": [
      "Highest VTE risk among inherited thrombophilias (10-25× increased)",
      "AT inhibits thrombin and Xa; heparin works by enhancing AT activity 1000-fold",
      "Heparin resistance is the clinical clue - PTT doesn't rise as expected",

      "Treatment: AT concentrate may be needed to achieve therapeutic anticoagulation"
    ],
    "statement": "Antithrombin deficiency is the highest-risk inherited thrombophilia, characterized by VTE and heparin resistance due to deficiency of the major natural inhibitor of thrombin and factor Xa, with antithrombin concentrate required for treatment of acute thrombosis.",
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Antithrombin is the main 'brake' on clotting - it grabs onto thrombin and factor Xa and shuts them down. Heparin works by making antithrombin grab much faster (1000× enhancement). Without enough antithrombin, heparin can't work properly, and the clotting system keeps going.",
      "key_insight": "Heparin resistance is the clinical giveaway. If you're giving adequate heparin doses but the PTT doesn't rise, think about antithrombin deficiency. This is because heparin's anticoagulant effect depends entirely on having sufficient antithrombin.",
      "technical_details": "Antithrombin is a serine protease inhibitor (serpin) synthesized by the liver. It irreversibly inhibits thrombin, Xa, IXa, XIa. Heparin binds a specific pentasaccharide sequence on AT, causing conformational change that accelerates inhibition 1000-fold. AT deficiency types: Type I (quantitative), Type II (qualitative - reactive site, heparin-binding site, or pleiotropic mutations)."
