    "title": "Hereditary Spherocytosis",
    "summary": "Hereditary spherocytosis (HS) is the most common inherited hemolytic anemia in people of Northern European descent, caused by defects in red blood cell membrane proteins (spectrin, ankyrin, band 3, or protein 4.2). The resulting membrane instability causes RBCs to lose membrane surface area, becoming spherical and less deformable, leading to splenic sequestration and extravascular hemolysis.",
    "key_points": [
      "Most common inherited hemolytic anemia in Northern Europeans",
      "Autosomal dominant (75%) or recessive; caused by membrane protein defects",
      "Spherocytes on peripheral smear with NEGATIVE Coombs test",
      "Triad: anemia, jaundice, splenomegaly",
      "Osmotic fragility test and eosin-5-maleimide (EMA) binding test diagnostic",
      "Splenectomy is curative for hemolysis (but infection risk)"
    ],
    "statement": "Hereditary spherocytosis is an inherited RBC membrane disorder causing chronic hemolytic anemia characterized by spherocytes, splenomegaly, and negative Coombs test, definitively treated by splenectomy.",
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Think of the RBC membrane as a flexible tent held up by spectrin poles attached to ankyrin stakes. In HS, defective poles or stakes make the tent unstable. The RBC loses membrane patches as it circulates, shrinking from a biconcave disc to a tight sphere that can't squeeze through splenic sinusoids.",
      "key_insight": "The negative Coombs test distinguishes hereditary spherocytosis from autoimmune hemolytic anemia - both show spherocytes, but HS has no antibodies on the RBC surface. Family history is key.",
      "technical_details": "Membrane proteins affected: spectrin-α (SPTA1), spectrin-β (SPTB), ankyrin (ANK1, most common), band 3 (SLC4A1), protein 4.2 (EPB42). Loss of vertical linkage between membrane skeleton and lipid bilayer leads to membrane vesiculation and surface area loss."
