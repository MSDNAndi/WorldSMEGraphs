    "title": "DOAC Therapy (Direct Oral Anticoagulants)",
    "summary": "Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are oral agents that directly inhibit specific coagulation factors without requiring cofactors. They include factor Xa inhibitors (rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban) and the direct thrombin inhibitor dabigatran. DOACs have predictable pharmacokinetics, no routine monitoring requirement, fewer drug interactions than warfarin, and specific reversal agents. They are first-line for most AFib and VTE indications but contraindicated in mechanical valves and antiphospholipid syndrome.",
    "key_points": [
      "Two classes: Xa inhibitors (-xabans) and thrombin inhibitor (dabigatran)",
      "No routine monitoring; fixed dosing based on weight/renal function",
      "Contraindicated: mechanical valves, antiphospholipid syndrome, severe renal impairment",
      "Reversal: Idarucizumab (dabigatran); Andexanet alfa (Xa inhibitors)",
      "Renal dosing critical: dabigatran most affected by renal impairment",
      "Fewer drug interactions than warfarin; P-gp inhibitors most important"
    ],
    "statement": "DOACs are oral anticoagulants directly inhibiting factor Xa or thrombin, offering predictable anticoagulation without routine monitoring, with specific reversal agents available, and contraindicated in mechanical valves and antiphospholipid syndrome.",
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Unlike warfarin which works indirectly by blocking vitamin K, DOACs directly grab onto and block specific clotting factors. Factor Xa inhibitors block the enzyme that converts prothrombin to thrombin; dabigatran blocks thrombin itself. This direct mechanism is faster and more predictable.",
      "key_insight": "The key advantage of DOACs over warfarin is predictability - fixed dosing, no monitoring, fewer interactions. The key disadvantage is that they all need dose adjustment for renal impairment (dabigatran most affected), and they cannot be used for mechanical valves or antiphospholipid syndrome.",
      "technical_details": "Factor Xa inhibitors (apixaban, rivaroxaban, edoxaban) bind to active site of factor Xa, blocking conversion of prothrombin to thrombin. Dabigatran etexilate is a prodrug activated by esterases; dabigatran binds thrombin's active site. DOACs are substrates of P-glycoprotein (P-gp); some also metabolized by CYP3A4. Half-lives 8-15 hours."
