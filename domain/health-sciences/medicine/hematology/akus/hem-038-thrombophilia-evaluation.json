    "title": "Thrombophilia Evaluation",
    "summary": "Thrombophilia evaluation involves testing for inherited and acquired conditions that increase venous thromboembolism (VTE) risk. Common inherited thrombophilias include factor V Leiden, prothrombin G20210A mutation, and deficiencies of protein C, protein S, and antithrombin. Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is the most important acquired thrombophilia. Testing is controversial - it rarely changes management as most VTE patients are treated the same regardless of results. Testing should be selective, avoiding acute thrombosis and anticoagulation periods that affect results.",
    "key_points": [
      "Most common inherited: Factor V Leiden (5% Caucasians), Prothrombin G20210A (2%)",
      "Natural anticoagulant deficiencies: Protein C, Protein S, Antithrombin (rarer but higher risk)",
      "Antiphospholipid syndrome: Most important acquired; affects management (warfarin preferred)",
      "Testing rarely changes management - most patients treated same regardless of results",
      "Timing matters: Avoid testing during acute clot or on anticoagulation",
      "Selective testing: Young age, unprovoked VTE, strong family history, unusual sites"
    ],
    "statement": "Thrombophilia evaluation tests for inherited (factor V Leiden, prothrombin mutation, natural anticoagulant deficiencies) and acquired (antiphospholipid syndrome) hypercoagulable states, but should be selective as results rarely change management for most patients.",
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Think of thrombophilia as having an overly aggressive clotting system. Some people are born with 'accelerators' (like factor V Leiden that resists being turned off) or missing 'brakes' (like protein C deficiency). Testing identifies these, but since we treat most VTE the same way, the bigger question is WHEN testing helps.",
      "key_insight": "The most impactful result is antiphospholipid syndrome - it genuinely changes management (warfarin preferred over DOACs, indefinite anticoagulation). For inherited thrombophilias, results may influence anticoagulation duration discussion but rarely dictate it. Family counseling and VTE prophylaxis in high-risk situations are potential benefits.",
      "technical_details": "Factor V Leiden: G1691A mutation causing APC resistance; heterozygotes have 5-7× VTE risk. Prothrombin G20210A: elevated prothrombin levels; 3× VTE risk. Protein C/S/AT deficiencies: 5-10× VTE risk. Testing affected by acute thrombosis (consumes proteins) and anticoagulation (warfarin reduces protein C/S; heparin reduces AT; DOACs interfere with functional assays)."
