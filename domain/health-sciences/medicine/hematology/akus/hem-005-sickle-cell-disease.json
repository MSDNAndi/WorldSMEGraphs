    "title": "Sickle Cell Disease",
    "summary": "Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an inherited hemoglobinopathy caused by a mutation in the beta-globin gene (HbS) resulting in polymerization of deoxygenated hemoglobin, red cell sickling, and vaso-occlusive crises. It is characterized by chronic hemolytic anemia, recurrent painful episodes, and multiorgan damage. Hydroxyurea, transfusions, and hematopoietic stem cell transplant are disease-modifying therapies; gene therapy is emerging.",
    "key_points": [
      "Genetics: Autosomal recessive; HbSS (homozygous); HbSC, HbS-beta thalassemia are compound heterozygotes",
      "Pathophysiology: HbS polymerization → sickling → vaso-occlusion + chronic hemolysis",
      "Acute complications: VOC, acute chest syndrome, stroke, splenic sequestration, aplastic crisis",
      "Chronic complications: Avascular necrosis, retinopathy, renal disease, pulmonary hypertension",
      "Hydroxyurea: Increases HbF, reduces VOC and ACS by 50%",
      "Curative: HSCT in children; gene therapy (lovotibeglogene, exagamglogene) emerging"
    ],
    "statement": "Sickle cell disease results from homozygous or compound heterozygous inheritance of the HbS mutation causing hemoglobin polymerization, vaso-occlusion, and chronic hemolysis with multi-organ damage managed by hydroxyurea, transfusions, and potentially curative stem cell or gene therapy.",
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "The sickle mutation (Glu→Val at position 6) makes hemoglobin 'sticky' when it releases oxygen. The sticky hemoglobin molecules clump together, distorting the RBC into a sickle shape that gets stuck in small blood vessels, blocking blood flow and causing pain and organ damage.",
      "key_insight": "SCD is both a hemolytic anemia AND a vaso-occlusive disease. The chronic hemolysis leads to anemia, jaundice, and gallstones; the vaso-occlusion causes acute pain crises and cumulative organ damage. Both pathways must be addressed.",
      "technical_details": "HbS polymerizes when deoxygenated due to hydrophobic valine on beta chain surface. Sickling is initially reversible but becomes irreversible with repeated cycles. HbF (fetal hemoglobin) interrupts polymerization - this is why hydroxyurea works by increasing HbF."
