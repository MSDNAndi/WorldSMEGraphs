    "title": "Thrombocytopenia Overview",
    "summary": "Thrombocytopenia is defined as a platelet count below 150 × 10⁹/L and is classified by mechanism: decreased production (marrow failure), increased destruction (immune, consumptive), sequestration (hypersplenism), or dilutional. Bleeding risk correlates with platelet count and function, with spontaneous bleeding typically occurring below 10-20 × 10⁹/L.",
    "key_points": [
      "Definition: platelets <150 × 10⁹/L; severe thrombocytopenia <50 × 10⁹/L",
      "Mechanisms: decreased production, increased destruction, sequestration, dilution",
      "First step: rule out pseudothrombocytopenia (EDTA-induced clumping)",
      "Peripheral smear is essential: platelet size, schistocytes, blasts, inclusions",
      "Bleeding risk increases significantly below 10-20 × 10⁹/L",
      "Transfusion threshold: <10 for prophylaxis, <50 for procedures, <100 for CNS/eye surgery"
    ],
    "statement": "Thrombocytopenia evaluation requires systematic classification by mechanism, confirmation on peripheral smear, and tailored management based on underlying cause with platelet transfusion reserved for significant bleeding or procedural needs.",
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Think of platelets like workers in a factory. Thrombocytopenia occurs when: (1) factory isn't producing workers (marrow failure), (2) workers are being destroyed on the job (immune/consumptive), (3) workers are stuck in the warehouse (splenic sequestration), or (4) workers are diluted out (massive transfusion).",
      "key_insight": "The peripheral smear is the most important initial test - it confirms true thrombocytopenia, provides clues to mechanism (large platelets = peripheral destruction, schistocytes = TMA, blasts = marrow failure), and guides further workup.",
      "technical_details": "EDTA-induced pseudothrombocytopenia occurs in 0.1% of samples from platelet agglutination by cold-reactive antiplatelet antibodies. Verify with citrate tube or smear. Immature platelet fraction (IPF) distinguishes production (low) from destruction (high) causes."
