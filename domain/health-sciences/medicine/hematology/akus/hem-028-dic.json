    "title": "Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC)",
    "summary": "DIC is a consumptive coagulopathy characterized by systemic activation of coagulation pathways leading to widespread microvascular thrombosis and simultaneous consumption of clotting factors and platelets, resulting in bleeding. It is always secondary to an underlying condition and treatment focuses on addressing the trigger.",
    "key_points": [
      "Always secondary to underlying disease: sepsis, trauma, malignancy, obstetric complications",
      "Pathophysiology: systemic thrombin generation → microvascular thrombosis + factor/platelet consumption → bleeding",
      "Laboratory: prolonged PT/PTT, low fibrinogen, elevated D-dimer, thrombocytopenia, schistocytes",
      "Treat underlying cause - this is paramount; supportive care with blood products",
      "Acute overt DIC: bleeding predominates; Chronic DIC: thrombosis may predominate (Trousseau syndrome)",
      "ISTH DIC scoring system helps diagnose overt DIC (score ≥5)"
    ],
    "statement": "Disseminated intravascular coagulation is a syndrome of systemic coagulation activation always triggered by an underlying disorder, characterized by simultaneous microvascular thrombosis and consumptive coagulopathy with bleeding, requiring treatment of the underlying cause and supportive blood product therapy.",
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Think of DIC as the coagulation system in 'overdrive' - massive tissue factor release triggers widespread clotting that consumes all the clotting factors and platelets faster than the body can make them. You're clotting AND bleeding at the same time, like stepping on the gas and brake simultaneously.",
      "key_insight": "DIC is NEVER a primary diagnosis - always ask 'What's causing this?' Sepsis, trauma, and obstetric complications are the most common triggers. Treating DIC without addressing the underlying cause is futile.",
      "technical_details": "Tissue factor exposure activates the extrinsic pathway. Thrombin generation causes fibrin deposition in microvasculature. Consumption of factors I (fibrinogen), V, VIII, and platelets causes bleeding. Secondary fibrinolysis from plasmin generates D-dimers. The ISTH scoring system uses platelet count, D-dimer, fibrinogen, and PT prolongation."
