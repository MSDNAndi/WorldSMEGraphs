    "title": "Vitamin B12 Deficiency",
    "summary": "Vitamin B12 (cobalamin) deficiency is a common cause of megaloblastic anemia characterized by impaired DNA synthesis leading to macrocytic RBCs and hypersegmented neutrophils. Unlike folate deficiency, B12 deficiency causes neurological manifestations including subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord due to its role in myelin synthesis.",
    "key_points": [
      "Causes megaloblastic anemia with MCV typically >100 fL",
      "Neurological symptoms (paresthesias, ataxia) distinguish from folate deficiency",
      "Pernicious anemia (autoimmune gastritis) is most common cause in developed countries",
      "Elevated methylmalonic acid (MMA) and homocysteine are diagnostic",
      "Treatment with parenteral or high-dose oral B12 reverses hematologic but not always neurologic deficits"
    ],
    "statement": "Vitamin B12 deficiency causes megaloblastic anemia through impaired DNA synthesis and may produce irreversible neurological damage through demyelination if not promptly diagnosed and treated.",
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "B12 is like a molecular recycling enzyme - it converts homocysteine back to methionine and methylmalonyl-CoA to succinyl-CoA. Without it, these substrates accumulate, DNA synthesis stalls in rapidly dividing cells (blood, GI), and myelin production fails in neurons.",
      "key_insight": "The 'methyl trap' hypothesis: Without B12, folate becomes trapped as methyltetrahydrofolate and cannot participate in DNA synthesis, explaining why both deficiencies cause identical megaloblastic anemia but only B12 deficiency causes neurological symptoms.",
      "technical_details": "B12 serves as cofactor for two enzymes: (1) Methionine synthase - transfers methyl group from methylTHF to homocysteine; (2) Methylmalonyl-CoA mutase - converts methylmalonyl-CoA to succinyl-CoA. MMA elevation is specific to B12 deficiency while homocysteine is elevated in both B12 and folate deficiency."
