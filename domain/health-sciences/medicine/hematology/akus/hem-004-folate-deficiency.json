    "title": "Folate Deficiency",
    "summary": "Folate (vitamin B9) deficiency causes megaloblastic anemia identical to B12 deficiency through impaired DNA synthesis. However, unlike B12 deficiency, folate deficiency does NOT cause neurological manifestations. The body's folate stores are limited (3-4 months), so deficiency develops more rapidly than B12 deficiency.",

      "Causes megaloblastic anemia identical to B12 deficiency",
      "NO neurological symptoms - key differentiator from B12 deficiency",
      "Limited body stores deplete in 3-4 months vs 3-6 years for B12",
      "Elevated homocysteine but NORMAL methylmalonic acid (MMA)",
      "Common causes: poor diet, alcoholism, pregnancy, medications (methotrexate, phenytoin)"
    ],
    "statement": "Folate deficiency causes megaloblastic anemia through impaired thymidine synthesis and DNA replication, developing more rapidly than B12 deficiency due to limited body stores, and notably lacking the neurological manifestations seen with B12 deficiency.",
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Think of folate as the 'one-carbon shuttle' - it carries single carbon units needed to make the building blocks of DNA (thymidine). Without it, cells that divide rapidly (blood cells, GI epithelium) cannot replicate their DNA properly.",
      "key_insight": "Unlike B12 deficiency, folate deficiency does not affect myelin synthesis, so neurological symptoms are absent. The key differentiator is that MMA is normal in folate deficiency (only elevated in B12 deficiency).",
      "technical_details": "Tetrahydrofolate (THF) accepts and donates one-carbon units essential for: (1) Thymidine synthesis (dUMP → dTMP via thymidylate synthase), (2) Purine synthesis, (3) Methionine regeneration from homocysteine. Methotrexate blocks dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), preventing THF regeneration."
