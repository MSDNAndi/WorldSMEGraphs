    "title": "Diabetic Ketoacidosis",
    "summary": "Life-threatening metabolic emergency characterized by hyperglycemia, ketosis, and high anion gap metabolic acidosis due to absolute or relative insulin deficiency",
    "key_points": [
      "Diagnostic triad: Hyperglycemia (>250 mg/dL), ketonemia/ketonuria, metabolic acidosis (pH <7.3, HCO3 <18)",
      "Most common in T1DM but can occur in T2DM during stress (infections, MI, medications)",

    "statement": "Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA) is an acute, life-threatening metabolic complication of diabetes mellitus characterized by the triad of hyperglycemia, ketonemia, and high anion gap metabolic acidosis, requiring immediate recognition and aggressive management.",
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Without insulin, cells cannot use glucose for energy and switch to breaking down fat. This produces ketones (acidic byproducts) that accumulate, making the blood dangerously acidic while glucose paradoxically rises in the bloodstream unable to enter cells.",
      "key_insight": "DKA represents the metabolic extreme of insulin deficiency - the body behaves as if in a starvation state despite elevated blood glucose. Understanding this paradox (high glucose but starving cells) is key to understanding pathophysiology and treatment.",
      "technical_details": "Insulin deficiency combined with elevated counter-regulatory hormones (glucagon, cortisol, catecholamines, GH) causes: 1) Hepatic gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis (hyperglycemia), 2) Lipolysis releasing free fatty acids, 3) Hepatic ketogenesis producing beta-hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate, 4) Osmotic diuresis causing dehydration and electrolyte losses."
