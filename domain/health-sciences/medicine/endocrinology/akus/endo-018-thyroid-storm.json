      "Medical emergency with mortality 10-30% even with treatment",
      "Usually precipitated by infection, surgery, trauma, or iodine load in uncontrolled hyperthyroidism",
      "Burch-Wartofsky score >45 diagnostic; 25-44 suggests impending storm",

    "statement": "Thyroid storm is a life-threatening endocrine emergency representing extreme decompensated thyrotoxicosis with fever, severe tachycardia, altered mental status, and multi-organ dysfunction requiring immediate aggressive multimodal treatment.",
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Thyroid storm is hyperthyroidism in crisis - the body's metabolic engine is revving so high it's about to fail. The extreme hypermetabolic state generates dangerously high body temperature and puts unsustainable demands on the heart.",
      "key_insight": "Treatment of thyroid storm requires blocking thyroid hormone effects at multiple levels simultaneously: beta-blockers for adrenergic symptoms, antithyroid drugs to stop new hormone synthesis, iodine to block hormone release, and steroids to inhibit peripheral conversion. Order matters - iodine must come after antithyroid drugs.",
      "technical_details": "The pathophysiology involves massive catecholamine-like effects from thyroid hormone excess. There is no threshold T4/T3 level that defines storm; it's a clinical diagnosis. The Burch-Wartofsky Point Scale (BWPS) uses temperature, CNS effects, GI/hepatic dysfunction, cardiovascular dysfunction, and heart failure to score severity."
