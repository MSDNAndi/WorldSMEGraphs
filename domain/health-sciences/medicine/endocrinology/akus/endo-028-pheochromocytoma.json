    "title": "Pheochromocytoma",
    "summary": "Rare catecholamine-secreting tumor arising from chromaffin cells of the adrenal medulla causing episodic hypertension, headache, sweating, and palpitations",
    "key_points": [
      "Rule of 10s: 10% bilateral, 10% malignant, 10% extra-adrenal (paraganglioma), 10% familial",
      "Classic triad: Episodic headache, sweating, palpitations with hypertension",
      "Diagnosis: Plasma free metanephrines (most sensitive) or 24-hr urine metanephrines",
      "Imaging: CT or MRI after biochemical confirmation; MIBG scan for localization/metastases",
      "Preoperative alpha-blockade (phenoxybenzamine) BEFORE beta-blockade essential",
      "Genetic testing recommended for all patients (30-40% have germline mutations)",
      "Paragangliomas are extra-adrenal pheochromocytomas (sympathetic or parasympathetic ganglia)"

    "statement": "Pheochromocytoma is a rare catecholamine-secreting tumor of the adrenal medulla causing potentially life-threatening hypertension, requiring biochemical confirmation before imaging and meticulous preoperative preparation with alpha-blockade before surgical resection.",
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Pheochromocytomas are tumors that produce adrenaline and noradrenaline. When these catecholamines are released in surges, patients experience the 'fight or flight' response - rapid heart rate, high blood pressure, sweating, and anxiety - but inappropriately and unpredictably.",
      "key_insight": "The 'pheo' adage 'alpha before beta' is life-saving. Blocking beta-receptors before alpha allows unopposed alpha-mediated vasoconstriction during catecholamine surge, causing dangerous hypertensive crisis. Always alpha-block first for 10-14 days before surgery.",
      "technical_details": "Catecholamines (epinephrine, norepinephrine, dopamine) are metabolized to metanephrines (metanephrine, normetanephrine) by COMT. These metabolites are continuously produced by tumor tissue and are more sensitive/specific for diagnosis than parent catecholamines. Hereditary syndromes (MEN2, VHL, SDH mutations, NF1) account for 30-40% of cases."
