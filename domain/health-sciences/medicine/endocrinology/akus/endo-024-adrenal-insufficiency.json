    "summary": "Inadequate production of adrenal cortex hormones (cortisol ± aldosterone) causing fatigue, hypotension, electrolyte abnormalities, and potential life-threatening adrenal crisis",
    "key_points": [
      "Primary AI (Addison's): Adrenal gland destruction; low cortisol, high ACTH, ± low aldosterone",
      "Secondary AI: Pituitary ACTH deficiency; low cortisol, low/normal ACTH, aldosterone preserved",
      "Tertiary AI: Most common; hypothalamic suppression from chronic glucocorticoid use",
      "Autoimmune adrenalitis is most common cause of primary AI in developed countries",
      "Morning cortisol <3 μg/dL diagnostic; 3-18 μg/dL requires ACTH stimulation test",

    ],
    "statement": "Adrenal insufficiency is a potentially life-threatening condition caused by inadequate production of glucocorticoids (cortisol) with or without mineralocorticoids (aldosterone), requiring lifelong hormone replacement and stress dose adjustments.",
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "The adrenal glands are your body's stress response system. Without adequate cortisol, the body cannot mount appropriate responses to stress - blood pressure drops, blood sugar falls, and even minor illnesses can become life-threatening.",
      "key_insight": "The key to understanding adrenal insufficiency is the axis level: Primary AI destroys the adrenal gland itself (losing both cortisol AND aldosterone), while secondary/tertiary AI affects ACTH production (preserving aldosterone since it's regulated by renin-angiotensin). This distinction guides treatment.",
      "technical_details": "Primary AI causes elevated ACTH (loss of negative feedback) with elevated MSH causing hyperpigmentation. The cosyntropin (ACTH) stimulation test assesses adrenal reserve: cortisol should rise to >18-20 μg/dL at 30-60 minutes. Failure to respond indicates primary AI or longstanding secondary AI with adrenal atrophy."
