    "title": "Hyperosmolar Hyperglycemic State",

    "key_points": [
      "Glucose typically >600 mg/dL (often >1000 mg/dL)",
      "Serum osmolality >320 mOsm/kg with profound dehydration",
      "Minimal or absent ketosis (sufficient insulin to prevent ketogenesis)",

    "statement": "Hyperosmolar Hyperglycemic State (HHS) is an acute, life-threatening metabolic complication of Type 2 diabetes characterized by severe hyperglycemia, profound dehydration, and hyperosmolarity without significant ketoacidosis, carrying higher mortality than DKA.",
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "In HHS, there is just enough insulin to prevent fat breakdown (ketogenesis) but not enough to control glucose. The result is extreme hyperglycemia that draws water from cells via osmosis, causing severe dehydration and altered mental status.",
      "key_insight": "Unlike DKA where insulin is completely absent, HHS patients have residual insulin that prevents ketone formation. This allows glucose to rise much higher before symptoms force medical attention, resulting in more severe dehydration and higher mortality.",
      "technical_details": "The pathophysiology involves relative insulin deficiency with elevated counter-regulatory hormones causing hepatic gluconeogenesis and impaired peripheral glucose utilization. Residual insulin suppresses lipolysis and ketogenesis. Osmotic diuresis from glycosuria causes massive fluid and electrolyte losses. Decreased GFR from dehydration further impairs glucose excretion."
