      "Graves' disease is the most common cause (60-80% of cases)",
      "Suppressed TSH with elevated Free T4 and/or Free T3 confirms diagnosis",

    "statement": "Hyperthyroidism is a clinical syndrome resulting from excess thyroid hormone production or release, causing a hypermetabolic state with cardiovascular, neuromuscular, and metabolic manifestations requiring definitive treatment.",
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "If hypothyroidism is the body running too slow, hyperthyroidism is running too fast. The excess thyroid hormone accelerates metabolism, heart rate, and body temperature - like being stuck in constant overdrive.",
      "key_insight": "Distinguishing the cause of hyperthyroidism is essential for treatment selection. Graves' disease (autoimmune TSH receptor stimulation) requires antithyroid drugs or ablation. Thyroiditis (inflammatory hormone release) is self-limited and only requires supportive care.",
      "technical_details": "Thyroid hormone excess increases basal metabolic rate, protein catabolism, and thermogenesis. Cardiovascular effects include increased cardiac output, decreased systemic vascular resistance, and beta-adrenergic receptor upregulation. Radioactive iodine uptake (RAIU) scan differentiates high-uptake causes (Graves', toxic nodule) from low-uptake causes (thyroiditis, exogenous hormone)."
