    "key_points": [
      "Insulin resistance in peripheral tissues (muscle, adipose, liver) is the hallmark",

    "statement": "Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) is a chronic metabolic disorder characterized by insulin resistance and progressive beta cell dysfunction, leading to hyperglycemia and increased risk of micro- and macrovascular complications.",
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Think of insulin as a key opening cell doors for glucose. In T2DM, the locks become resistant - cells don't respond to insulin properly. The pancreas compensates by producing more insulin, but eventually exhausts and can't keep up.",
      "key_insight": "T2DM is fundamentally a disease of both insulin resistance AND progressive beta cell failure. Understanding this dual defect explains why patients often need therapy intensification over time.",
      "technical_details": "T2DM pathophysiology involves the 'ominous octet': 1) Decreased insulin secretion, 2) Increased glucagon secretion, 3) Increased hepatic glucose production, 4) Neurotransmitter dysfunction, 5) Increased lipolysis, 6) Increased renal glucose reabsorption, 7) Decreased muscle glucose uptake, 8) Decreased incretin effect."
