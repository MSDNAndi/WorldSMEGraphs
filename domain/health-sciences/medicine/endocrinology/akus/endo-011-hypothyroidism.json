    "summary": "Clinical syndrome of thyroid hormone deficiency characterized by slowed metabolism affecting virtually all organ systems, most commonly caused by Hashimoto's thyroiditis in iodine-sufficient areas",
    "key_points": [
      "Primary hypothyroidism (95%) due to thyroid gland failure; elevated TSH, low T4",
      "Secondary/central hypothyroidism (5%) due to pituitary or hypothalamic disease; low/normal TSH, low T4",
      "Hashimoto's thyroiditis is most common cause in iodine-sufficient regions",
      "Classic symptoms: fatigue, cold intolerance, weight gain, constipation, dry skin, bradycardia",

    "statement": "Hypothyroidism is a clinical syndrome resulting from deficiency of thyroid hormones, causing widespread slowing of metabolic processes and affecting virtually all organ systems, requiring lifelong thyroid hormone replacement therapy.",
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Thyroid hormone is the body's metabolic thermostat. When deficient, everything slows down - heart rate, gut motility, reflexes, mental processing, and heat production. Patients literally 'run cold' physically and metabolically.",
      "key_insight": "Diagnosing hypothyroidism requires understanding the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis. In primary hypothyroidism, the failing thyroid cannot respond to TSH, so TSH rises in attempt to stimulate more hormone. In central hypothyroidism, the problem is insufficient TSH production.",
      "technical_details": "Thyroid hormones (T3, T4) regulate basal metabolic rate, thermogenesis, protein synthesis, and tissue differentiation. T4 is the predominant circulating hormone, converted to active T3 in peripheral tissues by deiodinases. Autoimmune destruction (Hashimoto's) involves anti-TPO and anti-thyroglobulin antibodies with lymphocytic infiltration and gradual thyroid failure."
