    "statement": "Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM) is a chronic autoimmune metabolic disorder characterized by selective destruction of insulin-producing pancreatic beta cells, resulting in absolute insulin deficiency and hyperglycemia requiring lifelong insulin replacement therapy.",
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Imagine the pancreas as a factory producing insulin, the key that unlocks cells to allow glucose entry. In T1DM, the immune system mistakenly attacks and destroys this factory, eliminating insulin production entirely.",
      "key_insight": "Unlike Type 2 diabetes where insulin resistance is primary, T1DM involves complete loss of insulin production. This distinction is crucial because T1DM patients are absolutely dependent on exogenous insulin for survival.",
      "technical_details": "T1DM pathogenesis involves genetic susceptibility (HLA-DR3/DR4), environmental triggers (viral infections, dietary factors), and autoimmune mechanisms. Beta cell destruction is mediated primarily by CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes recognizing beta cell autoantigens (proinsulin, GAD65, IA-2, ZnT8). Clinical diabetes manifests when 80-90% of beta cells are destroyed."
