    "title": "Cushing Syndrome",
    "summary": "Clinical manifestations of prolonged glucocorticoid excess from exogenous steroids, pituitary ACTH overproduction (Cushing disease), ectopic ACTH, or adrenal tumors",
    "key_points": [
      "Most common cause is exogenous/iatrogenic glucocorticoid use",
      "Cushing disease = pituitary ACTH-secreting adenoma (most common endogenous cause)",
      "Classic features: central obesity, purple striae, proximal myopathy, easy bruising",
      "Screening tests: 24-hr urinary free cortisol, late-night salivary cortisol, 1-mg overnight DST",
      "ACTH level distinguishes ACTH-dependent (pituitary, ectopic) from ACTH-independent (adrenal)",
      "High-dose dexamethasone suppression and inferior petrosal sinus sampling localize source",

    ],
    "statement": "Cushing syndrome encompasses the clinical manifestations of prolonged glucocorticoid excess from any source, requiring systematic evaluation to identify etiology and guide targeted treatment.",
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Cortisol is the body's stress hormone. In normal amounts it's essential, but chronic excess causes the body to break down - muscles weaken, bones thin, fat redistributes centrally, blood sugar rises, and the immune system becomes impaired.",
      "key_insight": "The diagnostic approach follows a logical sequence: First confirm hypercortisolism (screening tests), then determine if it's ACTH-dependent or independent (ACTH level), then localize the source (imaging, high-dose DST, IPSS). Each step narrows the differential.",
      "technical_details": "The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis shows loss of normal diurnal rhythm and loss of negative feedback suppression. In Cushing disease, the pituitary adenoma retains partial negative feedback (suppresses with high-dose dexamethasone). Ectopic ACTH tumors typically do not suppress. CRH stimulation causes ACTH rise in pituitary Cushing but not ectopic sources."
