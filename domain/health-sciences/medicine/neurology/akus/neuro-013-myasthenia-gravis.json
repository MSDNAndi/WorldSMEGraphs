    "title": "Myasthenia Gravis",
    "summary": "Myasthenia gravis (MG) is an autoimmune disorder of the neuromuscular junction characterized by antibodies against acetylcholine receptors (AChR) or muscle-specific kinase (MuSK) causing fatigable weakness of skeletal muscles. Hallmarks include ptosis, diplopia, bulbar weakness, and proximal limb weakness that worsens with activity.",
    "key_points": [
      "Fatigable weakness is the hallmark: symptoms worsen with activity and improve with rest",
      "Ocular MG: ptosis and diplopia; may remain localized or generalize within 2 years",
      "AChR antibodies positive in 85% of generalized MG; MuSK antibodies in 5-10% of seronegative cases",
      "Thymoma in 10-15%; thymectomy indicated for thymoma and recommended for non-thymoma generalized MG",
      "Myasthenic crisis: respiratory failure requiring intubation; triggered by infection, surgery, medications",
      "Treatment: acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (pyridostigmine), immunosuppression, thymectomy, IVIG/plasmapheresis"
    ],
    "statement": "Myasthenia gravis is a treatable autoimmune disorder affecting neuromuscular transmission. Recognition of fatigable weakness pattern, appropriate antibody testing, and vigilance for myasthenic crisis are essential for management.",
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Normally, acetylcholine (ACh) released from motor nerve terminals binds postsynaptic AChR, triggering muscle contraction. In MG, antibodies block, internalize, or destroy AChR, reducing the number of functional receptors. With repeated nerve stimulation, ACh release decreases (normal presynaptic depletion), and with fewer receptors, the safety margin for transmission is lost, causing fatigable weakness.",
      "key_insight": "The fatigability pattern distinguishes MG from other causes of weakness. Symptoms worsen later in the day or with repeated use. Tensilon (edrophonium) test transiently improves weakness by inhibiting acetylcholinesterase. MuSK-positive MG has distinct phenotype with prominent bulbar and respiratory involvement.",
      "technical_details": "Diagnostic tests: AChR binding antibodies (sens 85% generalized, 50% ocular); if negative, test MuSK and LRP4 antibodies. EMG shows decremental response (>10%) on repetitive nerve stimulation. Single-fiber EMG (most sensitive) shows increased jitter. CT chest for thymoma in all patients."

  "clinical_features": {
    "pathophysiology": {
      "mechanism": "AChR antibodies are predominantly IgG1/IgG3 that activate complement, causing destruction of the postsynaptic membrane and loss of AChR. They also directly block ACh binding and increase receptor internalization. MuSK antibodies (IgG4, non-complement fixing) impair agrin-LRP4-MuSK signaling required for AChR clustering. Both reduce the safety factor for neuromuscular transmission.",
      "key_pathways": [
        "AChR antibodies → complement activation → postsynaptic membrane destruction",
        "AChR antibodies → receptor blockade and accelerated internalization → reduced AChR density",
        "MuSK antibodies → impaired AChR clustering → dispersed receptors → transmission failure",
        "Thymus abnormalities (hyperplasia, thymoma) → source of autoreactive B cells"
