    "title": "Cervical Spondylotic Myelopathy",
    "summary": "Cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM) is spinal cord dysfunction resulting from degenerative narrowing of the cervical spinal canal. It is the most common cause of spinal cord dysfunction in adults over 55. Presenting features include gait difficulty, hand clumsiness, and upper motor neuron signs. Surgical decompression is typically required for progressive or moderate-severe myelopathy.",
    "key_points": [
      "Most common cause of spinal cord dysfunction in older adults; from degenerative spondylosis",
      "Hallmark symptoms: gait difficulty, hand clumsiness, neck stiffness, rarely pain",
      "Signs: spastic gait, hyperreflexia, Hoffman sign, Babinski sign, hand weakness/atrophy",
      "MRI shows cord compression with or without T2 signal change (myelomalacia)",
      "Natural history: stepwise decline; rarely improves spontaneously",
      "Surgery indicated for moderate-severe myelopathy or progression; anterior vs posterior approach"
    ],
    "statement": "CSM is a progressive condition requiring early recognition and often surgical intervention to prevent irreversible spinal cord damage. The diagnosis should be considered in any older adult with gait difficulty and upper motor neuron signs.",
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Degenerative changes in the cervical spine (disc herniation, osteophytes, ligamentum flavum hypertrophy) narrow the spinal canal. When the cord is compressed, ischemia and mechanical damage cause myelopathy. Long-term compression leads to irreversible cord damage (gliosis, myelomalacia).",
      "key_insight": "Unlike radiculopathy (radiating arm pain), myelopathy presents with gait difficulty and hand incoordination. Pain is often minimal. The absence of pain can delay diagnosis. T2 hyperintensity in the cord on MRI indicates myelomalacia, which is a poor prognostic sign.",
      "technical_details": "Clinical assessment: modified Japanese Orthopaedic Association (mJOA) score grades severity (18 normal; 12-17 mild; 9-11 moderate; <9 severe). MRI findings: canal stenosis, cord compression, T2 signal change (poor prognostic factor), cord atrophy. Surgical options: anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF), posterior laminoplasty or laminectomy fusion."

  "clinical_features": {
    "pathophysiology": {
      "mechanism": "Cervical spondylosis causes canal stenosis through: (1) disc degeneration and herniation, (2) osteophyte formation (bone spurs), (3) ligamentum flavum hypertrophy, (4) facet joint hypertrophy. Cord compression leads to ischemia (vascular compromise) and direct mechanical injury. Chronic compression causes demyelination, axonal loss, and gliosis (myelomalacia).",

        "Degenerative changes → cervical canal stenosis → cord compression",
