    "title": "Status Epilepticus",
    "summary": "Status epilepticus (SE) is a life-threatening neurological emergency defined as a seizure lasting >5 minutes or multiple seizures without recovery between. It requires immediate treatment with benzodiazepines followed by second-line agents and consideration of anesthetic agents for refractory cases.",
    "key_points": [
      "Definition: Seizure >5 min OR ≥2 seizures without return to baseline (operational)",
      "Traditional definition: >30 min; neuronal injury begins at 30-60 min",
      "First-line: IV lorazepam 4mg or IM midazolam 10mg (if no IV access)",
      "Second-line: IV fosphenytoin, levetiracetam, or valproate",
      "Refractory SE: Continuous seizures despite two AEDs; requires anesthetic infusion",
      "Mortality 20-30% in adults; higher with prolonged duration and older age"
    ],
    "statement": "Status epilepticus is a seizure lasting beyond 5 minutes requiring emergent benzodiazepine treatment, second-line antiepileptic drugs, and consideration of anesthetic agents for refractory cases to prevent permanent neurological injury.",
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Think of status epilepticus as a brain 'electrical fire' that, unlike normal seizures, doesn't self-extinguish. The longer it burns, the more permanent damage occurs. First responders use benzodiazepines as a 'fire extinguisher,' but if that doesn't work, progressively stronger agents are needed to stop the fire before irreversible brain injury occurs.",
      "key_insight": "TIME IS BRAIN in status epilepticus. The 5-minute operational definition exists because benzodiazepines become less effective as seizures continue (GABA receptor internalization), and neuronal injury accelerates after 30 minutes. The treatment protocol should be memorized and executed rapidly.",
      "technical_details": "With prolonged seizures, GABA-A receptors internalize, reducing benzodiazepine efficacy. NMDA receptors move to the surface, increasing excitotoxicity. Systemic complications include hyperthermia, rhabdomyolysis, acidosis, pulmonary edema. EEG monitoring is essential to detect non-convulsive SE and confirm seizure termination."
