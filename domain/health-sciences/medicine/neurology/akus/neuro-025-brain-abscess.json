    "statement": {
      "text": "Brain abscess is a focal suppurative infection of the brain parenchyma that presents with headache, focal neurological deficits, fever, and signs of increased intracranial pressure. MRI typically shows a ring-enhancing lesion with central restricted diffusion and surrounding vasogenic edema. Treatment requires prolonged IV antibiotics (6-8 weeks) and often surgical intervention for lesions >2.5cm, diagnostic uncertainty, or failure to improve. Common organisms include Streptococci, Staphylococci, and anaerobes, often polymicrobial.",
      "formal": "Brain Abscess = Ring-enhancing lesion + Central DWI restriction + Focal deficits ± Fever + Source identification"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "A brain abscess forms when bacteria seed the brain tissue (from nearby infection or via bloodstream), triggering an intense inflammatory response that walls off the infection into an encapsulated pus-filled cavity. The 'ring' on MRI represents the vascular capsule trying to contain the infection. Unlike tumors, abscesses restrict diffusion on MRI because the thick pus has limited water movement - a key distinguishing feature.",
      "key_insight": "The evolution from cerebritis to encapsulated abscess takes 2-3 weeks. Early cerebritis may not show classic ring enhancement - look for ill-defined enhancement. The capsule is typically thinner on the ventricular (medial) side due to decreased blood supply, making intraventricular rupture a devastating complication with 80% mortality.",
      "technical_details": "DWI showing restricted diffusion in the abscess center (bright on DWI, dark on ADC) distinguishes abscess from necrotic tumor (which typically does not restrict). MR spectroscopy shows amino acid peaks (succinate, acetate, lactate) from anaerobic bacterial metabolism. Immunocompromised patients may have atypical organisms (Toxoplasma, Aspergillus, Nocardia) requiring different empiric coverage."
