    "key_points": [
      "Circadian rhythm is controlled by suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) - the master clock",
      "Recovery rate: ~1 day per time zone crossed (faster westward, slower eastward)",
      "Eastward travel is harder: advancing the clock is more difficult than delaying",
      "Light exposure is the most powerful circadian entrainment tool (zeitgeber)",
      "Strategic melatonin use (0.5-3mg) can accelerate adaptation",
      "Jet lag impairs memory consolidation, attention, and decision-making",
      "Pre-adaptation (shifting sleep schedule before travel) reduces symptoms"
    ],
    "statement": {
      "text": "Jet lag (circadian dysrhythmia) occurs when rapid transmeridian travel desynchronizes the internal circadian clock, controlled by the suprachiasmatic nucleus, from the external light-dark cycle. This misalignment impairs sleep quality, cognitive performance, and physiological function. Strategic light exposure and melatonin timing can accelerate re-entrainment.",
      "formal": "Jet Lag Severity ∝ (Time Zones Crossed × Direction Factor); Recovery ≈ 1 day/zone; Eastward > Westward difficulty"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Your body runs on a 24-hour internal clock synchronized to your home time zone by the master pacemaker in your hypothalamus (SCN). When you fly across time zones, your internal clock and the external world are out of sync. Your body needs time (roughly one day per hour of time difference) to reset through light exposure.",
      "key_insight": "The direction of travel matters: traveling west 'extends' your day (easier to stay up late), while traveling east 'shortens' it (harder to fall asleep earlier). This asymmetry reflects the natural tendency of the human circadian system to run slightly longer than 24 hours."
