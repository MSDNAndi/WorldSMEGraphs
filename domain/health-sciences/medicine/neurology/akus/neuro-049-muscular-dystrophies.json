    "title": "Muscular Dystrophies",
    "summary": "Muscular dystrophies are a group of inherited disorders characterized by progressive muscle weakness and degeneration. Major types include Duchenne (DMD) and Becker (BMD) dystrophy from dystrophin mutations, myotonic dystrophy, facioscapulohumeral (FSHD), and limb-girdle muscular dystrophies (LGMD). Diagnosis relies on clinical pattern, CK levels, genetic testing, and sometimes muscle biopsy.",
    "key_points": [
      "Duchenne: X-linked, absent dystrophin, onset age 3-5, wheelchair by 12, death by 20s-30s without treatment",
      "Becker: X-linked, reduced dystrophin, milder course, ambulatory into adulthood",
      "Myotonic dystrophy type 1: autosomal dominant CTG repeat, myotonia + multisystem involvement",
      "FSHD: chromosome 4q35, face/shoulder/arm weakness, scapular winging",
      "LGMD: heterogeneous group (>30 subtypes), proximal weakness, variable CK elevation",
      "Treatment: corticosteroids for DMD, gene-targeted therapies emerging (exon skipping, gene replacement)"
    ],
    "statement": "Muscular dystrophies are progressive genetic disorders with distinct inheritance patterns, clinical phenotypes, and increasingly specific treatments. Recognition of clinical patterns guides genetic testing and multidisciplinary management.",
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Dystrophin is a structural protein linking the muscle cell cytoskeleton to the extracellular matrix. When absent (DMD) or defective (BMD), muscle fibers are mechanically fragile and damaged during contraction. Over time, repeated cycles of damage and incomplete repair lead to fibrosis and fatty replacement.",
      "key_insight": "The reading frame rule explains DMD vs BMD severity: frameshift mutations cause complete dystrophin absence (DMD); in-frame deletions allow some functional dystrophin production (BMD). This understanding led to exon-skipping therapies that restore the reading frame.",
      "technical_details": "DMD: absent dystrophin on immunostaining, CK >10,000, genetic testing confirms. Myotonic dystrophy: CTG repeat >50 (normal <37); anticipation phenomenon. FSHD: D4Z4 repeat contraction to 1-10 repeats on permissive haplotype. Genetic testing is now first-line before muscle biopsy."

  "clinical_features": {
    "pathophysiology": {
      "mechanism": "In dystrophinopathies, absence or dysfunction of dystrophin disrupts the dystrophin-associated glycoprotein complex linking cytoskeleton to ECM. Without this structural support, sarcolemma is damaged during contraction, allowing calcium influx, which triggers proteolysis and necrosis. Repeated damage exhausts regenerative capacity, leading to fibrosis and fatty replacement.",
      "key_pathways": [
        "Dystrophin mutation → absent/dysfunctional dystrophin → DAGC destabilization",
        "Sarcolemmal fragility → contraction-induced damage → calcium influx",
        "Calcium overload → proteolysis → muscle fiber necrosis → CK elevation",
        "Repeated damage → regenerative failure → fibrosis/fatty replacement"
      ],
      "clinical_significance": "Understanding molecular pathogenesis has enabled targeted therapies: exon-skipping (eteplirsen for exon 51), gene replacement (micro-dystrophin), and emerging CRISPR approaches."
