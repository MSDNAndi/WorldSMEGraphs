    "title": "Trigeminal Neuralgia",
    "summary": "Trigeminal neuralgia (TN) is a facial pain disorder characterized by sudden, brief, unilateral, electric shock-like paroxysms in the distribution of one or more trigeminal nerve branches, typically triggered by innocuous stimuli. Carbamazepine is first-line treatment, with microvascular decompression for refractory cases.",
    "key_points": [
      "Classic TN: sudden, severe, lancinating pain lasting seconds to 2 minutes",
      "V2 (maxillary) and V3 (mandibular) most commonly affected",
      "Triggered by light touch, chewing, talking, cold wind",
      "Carbamazepine or oxcarbazepine is first-line treatment",
      "MRI with dedicated neurovascular sequences to exclude secondary causes",
      "Microvascular decompression for medically refractory cases"
    ],
    "statement": "Trigeminal neuralgia is characterized by recurrent paroxysms of unilateral facial pain in the trigeminal distribution, typically triggered by innocuous stimuli, caused by neurovascular compression or secondary pathology, and treated with anticonvulsants or surgical decompression.",
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Imagine the trigeminal nerve as a frayed electrical wire. When something touches the frayed area - even a gentle breeze or brushing teeth - it short-circuits and sends searing pain signals. That's why patients describe 'electric shocks' triggered by harmless activities.",
      "key_insight": "The distinction between classic (Type 1) and Type 2 TN is clinically important: Type 1 has discrete attacks with pain-free intervals; Type 2 has constant background pain with superimposed paroxysms. This affects treatment selection and prognosis.",
      "technical_details": "Neurovascular compression, typically by the superior cerebellar artery at the root entry zone, causes focal demyelination. This creates ephaptic transmission (cross-talk) between fibers, explaining why light touch (Aβ fibers) triggers pain (Aδ/C fiber activation). MRI with FIESTA/CISS sequences visualizes the offending vessel."
