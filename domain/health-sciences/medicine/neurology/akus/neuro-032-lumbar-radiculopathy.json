    "title": "Lumbar Radiculopathy",
    "summary": "Lumbar radiculopathy is a condition caused by compression or irritation of lumbar nerve roots, resulting in radicular pain, sensory changes, and/or weakness in a dermatomal distribution. L4-L5 and L5-S1 disc herniations are most common. Diagnosis is clinical with MRI confirmation when needed. Most cases resolve with conservative management.",
    "key_points": [
      "L5 and S1 radiculopathies account for ~90% of cases",
      "Straight leg raise (SLR) sensitive for L5/S1; femoral stretch for L2-L4",
      "Red flags: cauda equina syndrome, progressive weakness, saddle anesthesia",
      "MRI indicated if symptoms persist >6 weeks, red flags, or considering surgery",
      "80-90% improve with conservative treatment within 6-12 weeks",
      "Surgery (discectomy) if severe/progressive deficit or failed conservative care"
    ],
    "statement": "Lumbar radiculopathy is dysfunction of a lumbar nerve root causing dermatomal pain, sensory loss, and/or myotomal weakness, most commonly from disc herniation, diagnosed clinically with provocative maneuvers and confirmed by MRI when surgery is considered.",
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Imagine a nerve root as a cable exiting the spine. When a bulging disc pinches this cable, the entire territory it supplies lights up with pain, numbness, or weakness. The L5 nerve controls ankle dorsiflexion - so when L5 is pinched, you get a foot drop and pain shooting down the lateral leg.",
      "key_insight": "The clinical localization is the key skill: each nerve root has specific motor, sensory, and reflex findings. L4 = knee extension + patellar reflex; L5 = ankle dorsiflexion + no good reflex; S1 = ankle plantarflexion + ankle reflex. Pain radiating past the knee suggests true radiculopathy.",
      "technical_details": "Disc herniation typically occurs posterolaterally, compressing the traversing root (L4-L5 disc compresses L5 root). Far lateral herniation compresses the exiting root (L4-L5 disc compresses L4 root). The SLR stretches L5/S1 roots and is positive if pain reproduced at 30-70° of elevation."
