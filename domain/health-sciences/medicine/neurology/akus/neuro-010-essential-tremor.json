    "summary": "Essential tremor is the most common movement disorder, characterized by action tremor (postural and kinetic) primarily affecting the hands, often with head or voice involvement. It improves with alcohol and worsens with stress. Unlike Parkinson disease, it is bilateral, symmetric, and lacks rigidity, bradykinesia, and postural instability. First-line treatments include propranolol and primidone.",
    "key_points": [
      "Most common movement disorder; 10× more common than Parkinson disease",
      "Action tremor (postural and kinetic); NOT rest tremor",
      "Bilateral and relatively symmetric; hands most commonly affected",
      "Often affects head ('no-no' or 'yes-yes' movement) and voice",
      "Improves with alcohol (diagnostically useful but not therapeutic)",
      "Worsens with stress, caffeine, fatigue",
      "First-line: propranolol (beta-blocker) or primidone (anticonvulsant)",
      "DBS of ventral intermediate nucleus (VIM) for refractory cases"
    ],
    "statement": "Essential tremor is a progressive, often familial tremor disorder that primarily affects the upper extremities during action. While sometimes called 'benign,' it can significantly impair quality of life. Understanding its distinction from Parkinson disease is crucial, as the pathophysiology, treatment, and prognosis differ substantially.",
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Think of essential tremor as the cerebellum's 'brake pedal' not working properly. When you try to hold something steady or reach for a target, the cerebellum normally dampens oscillations and provides smooth movement. In essential tremor, this dampening fails, causing a rhythmic oscillation that's worst during the action itself.",
      "key_insight": "The key distinction from Parkinson disease is the type of tremor: essential tremor is an ACTION tremor (present during movement and holding positions) while Parkinson tremor is a RESTING tremor (present at rest, suppressed during movement). Also, essential tremor is bilateral from the start, while Parkinson typically starts unilaterally.",
      "technical_details": "The underlying pathophysiology involves the cerebello-thalamo-cortical circuit. GABAergic dysfunction and abnormal oscillatory activity in the inferior olive and cerebellum generate the tremor. Postmortem studies show Purkinje cell loss and torpedoes (swollen axons). The VIM nucleus of the thalamus is the target for DBS because it is a key relay in this circuit."
