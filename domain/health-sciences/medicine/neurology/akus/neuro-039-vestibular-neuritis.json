    "title": "Vestibular Neuritis",
    "summary": "Vestibular neuritis is an acute peripheral vestibular syndrome caused by inflammation of the vestibular nerve, presenting with acute onset severe vertigo, nausea, vomiting, and gait instability lasting days to weeks. Unlike labyrinthitis, hearing is preserved. Treatment is supportive with vestibular rehabilitation.",
    "key_points": [
      "Acute onset vertigo lasting days; typically post-viral; hearing preserved (unlike labyrinthitis)",
      "Unidirectional horizontal-torsional nystagmus beating away from affected ear; suppressed by fixation",
      "HINTS exam differentiates from central causes: peripheral = HI-negative, N-unidirectional, TS-negative",
      "Head impulse test positive (catch-up saccade) toward affected side indicates peripheral lesion",
      "Treatment: symptomatic (meclizine, ondansetron) acutely; vestibular rehabilitation for recovery",
      "Prognosis: most recover; 50% have residual vestibular hypofunction; some develop BPPV later"
    ],
    "statement": "Vestibular neuritis is a common cause of acute vertigo that can mimic posterior circulation stroke. The HINTS exam is critical for distinguishing peripheral from central causes at bedside.",
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "The vestibular nerve normally provides symmetric input from both labyrinths. Acute inflammation of one vestibular nerve creates sudden asymmetry, interpreted by the brain as rotation (vertigo). The brain receives normal input from one side and reduced input from the affected side, generating nystagmus beating toward the stronger (normal) side.",
      "key_insight": "HINTS exam is more sensitive than early MRI for posterior circulation stroke in acute vestibular syndrome. A 'peripheral' pattern (positive head impulse, direction-fixed nystagmus, no skew) essentially rules out stroke. A 'central' pattern (negative head impulse, direction-changing nystagmus, skew deviation) mandates stroke workup.",
      "technical_details": "Head Impulse Test (HI): brisk head rotation toward affected side produces catch-up saccade (positive = peripheral). Nystagmus (N): direction-fixed, horizontal-torsional, beats away from lesion (peripheral). Test of Skew (TS): alternating cover test; vertical deviation suggests central. HINTS: HI-N-TS; one central finding = stroke until proven otherwise."

  },
  "clinical_features": {
    "pathophysiology": {
      "mechanism": "Vestibular neuritis is thought to result from viral inflammation (likely HSV-1 reactivation) of the vestibular nerve, particularly the superior division. Acute damage causes sudden loss of tonic vestibular input from one side. The vestibular nuclei receive asymmetric input, generating the sensation of rotation and nystagmus. Over days to weeks, central compensation restores balance.",
      "key_pathways": [
        "Viral infection/reactivation → vestibular nerve inflammation",
        "Sudden unilateral vestibular hypofunction → asymmetric input to vestibular nuclei",
        "Asymmetric vestibular nuclei activity → nystagmus + vertigo",
        "Central compensation over weeks → gradual recovery"
      ],
      "clinical_significance": "Vestibular neuritis is benign but causes significant morbidity. The main clinical challenge is distinguishing it from posterior circulation stroke, which can present identically but requires emergent treatment."
