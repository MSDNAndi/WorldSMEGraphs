    "title": "Peripheral Neuropathy",
    "summary": "Peripheral neuropathy is dysfunction of peripheral nerves causing sensory, motor, and/or autonomic symptoms. It is classified by fiber type (large vs small fiber), distribution (length-dependent vs non-length-dependent), pathology (axonal vs demyelinating), and etiology. Diabetes is the most common cause; systematic workup identifies treatable causes.",
    "key_points": [
      "Diabetes and prediabetes account for ~50% of cases",
      "Length-dependent (stocking-glove) pattern is most common",
      "Distinguish axonal (gradual, distal weakness) from demyelinating (proximal, areflexia) on NCS/EMG",
      "Small fiber neuropathy: burning pain, autonomic symptoms; normal NCS; diagnose by skin biopsy",
      "Initial workup: glucose, HbA1c, B12, TSH, SPEP; expand based on clinical suspicion",
      "Treat underlying cause; neuropathic pain responds to gabapentinoids, TCAs, SNRIs"
    ],
    "statement": "Peripheral neuropathy is a disorder of peripheral nerves classified by distribution, fiber type, pathophysiology, and etiology, with diabetes being the most common cause, requiring systematic evaluation to identify treatable conditions and appropriate symptomatic management.",
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Peripheral nerves are like the wiring connecting your brain to your body. When this wiring is damaged, signals get scrambled - you might feel numbness, tingling, burning, or weakness. The 'stocking-glove' pattern occurs because the longest nerves (going to feet/hands) are most vulnerable.",
      "key_insight": "The NCS/EMG distinction between axonal and demyelinating neuropathy is crucial: axonal (reduced amplitudes, normal velocities) suggests toxic/metabolic causes, while demyelinating (slow velocities, conduction block) suggests inflammatory or hereditary causes that may be treatable.",
      "technical_details": "Large fiber neuropathy affects Aα (proprioception) and Aβ (touch) fibers causing numbness, imbalance, and areflexia. Small fiber neuropathy affects Aδ (cold, sharp pain) and C fibers (warm, dull pain, autonomic) causing burning dysesthesias and autonomic dysfunction with normal NCS."
