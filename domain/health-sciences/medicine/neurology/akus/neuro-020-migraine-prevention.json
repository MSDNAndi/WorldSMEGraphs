    "title": "Migraine Prevention Therapy",
    "summary": "Migraine prevention aims to reduce attack frequency, severity, and duration when patients have ≥4 headache days/month, significant disability, or failure of acute treatments. Options include oral preventives (beta-blockers, anticonvulsants, antidepressants), CGRP monoclonal antibodies, and non-pharmacologic approaches (biofeedback, cognitive behavioral therapy).",
    "key_points": [
      "Indication: ≥4 migraine days/month, significant disability, overuse of acute medications, or failure/contraindication to acute therapy",
      "First-line oral options: propranolol, topiramate, amitriptyline, valproate; evidence-based efficacy",
      "CGRP monoclonal antibodies (erenumab, fremanezumab, galcanezumab): effective, well-tolerated, monthly or quarterly dosing",
      "OnabotulinumtoxinA: approved for chronic migraine (≥15 headache days/month); specific injection protocol",
      "Lifestyle modifications: regular sleep, hydration, stress management, avoiding triggers",
      "Success defined as ≥50% reduction in migraine days after 2-3 months of adequate trial"
    ],
    "statement": "Effective migraine prevention reduces disease burden and improves quality of life. Treatment selection should be individualized based on comorbidities, side effect profiles, patient preferences, and insurance coverage.",
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Preventive medications work through various mechanisms to raise the migraine threshold, making attacks less likely to occur. Beta-blockers reduce sympathetic activity; topiramate modulates ion channels; amitriptyline affects serotonin/norepinephrine; CGRP antibodies block a key migraine signaling molecule released during attacks.",
      "key_insight": "CGRP monoclonal antibodies represent a paradigm shift - they are the first migraine-specific preventive therapy. Unlike oral preventives with broad mechanisms and significant side effects, CGRP antibodies target migraine pathophysiology directly with excellent tolerability. However, cost and access remain barriers.",
      "technical_details": "Adequate trial: 2-3 months at target dose before determining efficacy. Start low, titrate slowly for oral preventives. Goal is ≥50% reduction in migraine days. CGRP antibodies: erenumab (70-140mg SC monthly), fremanezumab (225mg monthly or 675mg quarterly), galcanezumab (240mg loading then 120mg monthly)."

  "clinical_features": {
    "pathophysiology": {
      "mechanism": "Migraine involves trigeminal activation with release of CGRP and other neuropeptides, causing neurogenic inflammation and pain. Preventive therapies either reduce cortical excitability (anticonvulsants), modulate neurotransmitter systems (antidepressants, beta-blockers), or directly block CGRP signaling (monoclonal antibodies). The goal is to increase the threshold for triggering migraine attacks.",

        "Beta-blockers: reduce sympathetic activity, possibly affecting trigeminovascular system",
