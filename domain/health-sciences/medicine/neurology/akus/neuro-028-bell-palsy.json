    "statement": {
      "text": "Bell palsy is an acute idiopathic peripheral facial nerve (CN VII) palsy resulting in unilateral facial weakness affecting both upper and lower facial muscles. It is the most common cause of acute facial paralysis, presumed to be caused by herpes simplex virus reactivation in the geniculate ganglion. Early treatment with corticosteroids within 72 hours of onset significantly improves complete recovery rates. The prognosis is generally favorable with 70% achieving complete recovery spontaneously and 85% with steroid treatment.",
      "formal": "Bell Palsy = Acute unilateral facial weakness (upper + lower) + No identifiable cause + Exclusion of central lesion"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "The facial nerve takes a long, winding path through a narrow bony canal in the skull (the facial canal). When the nerve swells - likely from viral reactivation - it gets compressed within this tight space, leading to dysfunction. Understanding that it's a peripheral nerve problem explains why the entire side of the face is weak (forehead included), unlike strokes which spare the forehead due to bilateral cortical innervation of upper facial muscles.",
      "key_insight": "The critical clinical distinction is upper vs lower motor neuron facial weakness. In Bell palsy (LMN), the entire hemifacial weakness occurs because the facial nerve directly innervates all ipsilateral facial muscles. In central (UMN) lesions like stroke, the forehead is spared because the forehead muscles receive bilateral cortical input, so the contralateral hemisphere can compensate.",
      "technical_details": "The facial nerve carries motor fibers to facial muscles, parasympathetic fibers to lacrimal and salivary glands (via greater petrosal and chorda tympani), special sensory fibers for taste from anterior 2/3 of tongue (chorda tympani), and general sensory from external auditory canal. Depending on lesion location within the facial canal, patients may have hyperacusis (stapedius weakness), decreased lacrimation, or taste disturbance in addition to facial weakness."
