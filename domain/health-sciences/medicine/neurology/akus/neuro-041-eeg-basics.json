    "statement": {
      "text": "Electroencephalography (EEG) is a non-invasive neurophysiological technique that records electrical activity generated by the cerebral cortex through electrodes placed on the scalp according to the international 10-20 system. It is the primary diagnostic tool for epilepsy, providing evidence of seizure activity and epileptiform abnormalities, and is essential for evaluating encephalopathy, altered consciousness, brain death determination, and monitoring in the ICU setting.",
      "formal": "EEG = Scalp recording of cortical electrical activity (1-70 Hz) | Epileptiform = Spikes (<70ms) or Sharp waves (70-200ms) | PDR = 8-13 Hz alpha"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "The EEG detects the electrical 'conversation' happening across millions of brain cells. When neurons fire in synchronized patterns, their combined signals are strong enough to detect at the scalp. Think of it like listening to a stadium crowd - you can't hear individual voices, but you can detect when everyone cheers together. Abnormal patterns occur when groups of neurons fire too synchronously (seizures) or too slowly (encephalopathy).",
      "key_insight": "The EEG records postsynaptic potentials, not action potentials - it reflects the net effect of excitatory and inhibitory inputs on cortical pyramidal neurons. This is why EEG primarily reflects cortical activity and has limited sensitivity for deep structures. Epileptiform discharges represent hypersynchronous neuronal firing that may or may not produce clinical seizures.",
      "technical_details": "Signal amplitude is typically 10-100 microvolts, requiring significant amplification. The 10-20 system ensures standardized electrode placement based on skull landmarks (nasion, inion, preauricular points). Montages (bipolar, referential) affect waveform appearance. Digital EEG allows post-hoc remontaging and quantitative analysis. High-frequency activity (>30 Hz) and low-frequency activity (<1 Hz) can be filtered to reduce artifact."
