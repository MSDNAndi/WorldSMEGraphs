    "key_points": [
      "Most common primary headache (lifetime prevalence 30-78%)",

    "statement": {
      "text": "Tension-type headache (TTH) is the most common primary headache disorder, characterized by bilateral, pressing or tightening (non-pulsating) pain of mild-to-moderate intensity that is not aggravated by routine physical activity and is not associated with nausea. Unlike migraine, patients can typically continue daily activities. TTH is classified as episodic (infrequent or frequent) or chronic based on frequency. First-line treatment for episodic TTH includes simple analgesics (NSAIDs, acetaminophen), while chronic TTH may benefit from preventive therapy with amitriptyline.",
      "formal": "TTH = Bilateral + Pressing/tightening + Mild-moderate + NOT aggravated by activity + NO nausea + NOT both photophobia AND phonophobia"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Tension-type headache is the 'everyday' headache most people have experienced - a dull, diffuse pressure as if a band is wrapped around the head. Unlike migraine, it doesn't throb, doesn't cause nausea, and doesn't force you to stop what you're doing. The name 'tension' historically suggested muscle tension as the cause, but the pathophysiology is now understood to be more complex, involving both peripheral and central sensitization mechanisms.",
      "key_insight": "The key diagnostic feature is what TTH LACKS: no throbbing, no nausea, no significant disability from the pain, no worsening with activity. This 'featureless' headache is diagnosed when migraine features are absent. Chronic TTH (≥15 days/month) can be quite debilitating despite mild individual attacks due to the cumulative burden.",
      "technical_details": "Peripheral mechanisms include myofascial pain (increased pericranial muscle tenderness) and nociceptor sensitization. Central mechanisms include sensitization of second-order neurons in the trigeminal nucleus caudalis and dysfunction of supraspinal pain modulation. Chronic TTH may represent a continuum with chronic migraine, sharing central sensitization features."
