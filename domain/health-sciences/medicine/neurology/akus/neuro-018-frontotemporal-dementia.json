    "title": "Frontotemporal Dementia",
    "summary": "Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is a clinically and pathologically heterogeneous group of neurodegenerative disorders primarily affecting the frontal and temporal lobes, characterized by progressive changes in behavior, personality, and/or language, typically with younger onset (45-65 years) and relative sparing of memory early in the disease course.",
    "key_points": [
      "Second most common cause of early-onset dementia (after Alzheimer's)",
      "Three main clinical variants: behavioral (bvFTD), semantic (svPPA), nonfluent (nfvPPA)",
      "bvFTD: disinhibition, apathy, loss of empathy, compulsive behaviors",
      "Memory relatively preserved early; personality/behavior changes predominate",
      "30-50% have genetic cause (C9orf72, MAPT, GRN mutations)",
      "MRI shows focal frontal and/or temporal atrophy; 'knife-edge' gyri"
    ],
    "statement": "Frontotemporal dementia is a neurodegenerative syndrome characterized by progressive deterioration of behavior, personality, and/or language due to selective frontal and temporal lobe degeneration, with typically younger onset and initial preservation of episodic memory.",
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "While Alzheimer's attacks memory first, FTD attacks the parts of the brain that make us 'who we are' - our personality, social behavior, and language. A patient with FTD might forget social rules, act inappropriately, or lose the meaning of words, while still remembering their grandchildren's names.",
      "key_insight": "The three clinical variants reflect different anatomical patterns: behavioral variant (frontal lobe) causes disinhibition and apathy; semantic variant (anterior temporal) causes loss of word/object meaning; nonfluent variant (left perisylvian) causes effortful, agrammatic speech.",
      "technical_details": "FTD pathology is classified as FTLD-tau (4R or 3R tauopathies including Pick's disease, PSP, CBD), FTLD-TDP (types A-E), or FTLD-FUS. C9orf72 hexanucleotide repeat expansion is the most common genetic cause and can present with FTD, ALS, or both."
