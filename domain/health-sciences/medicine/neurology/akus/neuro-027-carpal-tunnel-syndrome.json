    "title": "Carpal Tunnel Syndrome",
    "summary": "Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is the most common entrapment neuropathy, caused by compression of the median nerve at the wrist within the carpal tunnel. It presents with nocturnal paresthesias in the median nerve distribution and, if severe, thenar weakness. Diagnosis is clinical with NCS/EMG confirmation. Treatment ranges from splinting to surgical release.",
    "key_points": [
      "Most common entrapment neuropathy; median nerve compression at wrist",
      "Classic presentation: nocturnal hand numbness/tingling awakening patient",
      "Sensory symptoms in thumb, index, middle, and radial half of ring finger",
      "Phalen test (wrist flexion) and Tinel sign (tapping over carpal tunnel) are provocative",
      "NCS shows prolonged distal sensory latency across the wrist",
      "Splinting for mild-moderate; carpal tunnel release for severe or refractory"
    ],
    "statement": "Carpal tunnel syndrome is compression of the median nerve at the wrist causing sensory symptoms in the median distribution and thenar weakness when severe, diagnosed clinically and confirmed by NCS, and treated with splinting or surgical decompression.",
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "The carpal tunnel is like a crowded subway car with the median nerve as one passenger. When the tunnel gets even slightly smaller (inflammation, fluid, repetitive strain), the nerve gets squeezed. This causes the classic symptoms of numbness and tingling, worse at night because wrist position during sleep further compresses the tunnel.",
      "key_insight": "Nocturnal symptoms are the key clinical clue: patients wake at night shaking their hands to relieve numbness ('flick sign'). This happens because wrist flexion during sleep narrows the carpal tunnel. Weakness is a late finding indicating severe compression with axonal loss.",
      "technical_details": "The carpal tunnel is bounded by carpal bones and the transverse carpal ligament. Contents: 9 flexor tendons + median nerve. Any space-occupying process or volume increase causes nerve compression. NCS shows prolonged distal sensory latency (>3.5ms) and prolonged distal motor latency (>4.2ms) across the wrist."
