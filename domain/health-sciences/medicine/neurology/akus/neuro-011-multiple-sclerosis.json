    "summary": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic immune-mediated demyelinating disease of the central nervous system characterized by lesions disseminated in space and time. The relapsing-remitting form (RRMS) is most common. Diagnosis uses the McDonald criteria integrating clinical findings and MRI. Disease-modifying therapies reduce relapses and disability progression.",

      "CNS demyelination with axonal injury; spares peripheral nervous system",
      "Relapsing-remitting (RRMS) in 85%; secondary progressive (SPMS) develops later",
      "McDonald criteria: dissemination in space (DIS) + dissemination in time (DIT)",

    "statement": "Multiple sclerosis is a chronic immune-mediated demyelinating disease of the CNS diagnosed by demonstrating lesions disseminated in space and time, treated with disease-modifying therapies to reduce relapse frequency and delay disability progression.",
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Imagine the CNS as an electrical system with insulated wires (myelin). In MS, the immune system attacks this insulation at multiple random spots throughout the brain and spinal cord. Some attacks heal partially; others leave permanent damage. The key is that attacks happen in different places at different times.",
      "key_insight": "The concept of 'dissemination in space AND time' is the diagnostic cornerstone. A single lesion isn't MS; multiple lesions in one location isn't MS. You need BOTH - lesions in multiple CNS areas that developed at different time points - to diagnose MS confidently.",
      "technical_details": "MS lesions are perivenular inflammatory infiltrates with T-cell, B-cell, and macrophage involvement causing demyelination and ultimately axonal transection. Oligoclonal bands in CSF (present in 95%) indicate intrathecal IgG synthesis. High-efficacy DMTs (natalizumab, ocrelizumab) may halt NEDA (no evidence of disease activity) in many patients."
