    "title": "Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension (Pseudotumor Cerebri)",
    "summary": "Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is a disorder of elevated intracranial pressure without identifiable cause, presenting with headache, papilledema, and visual symptoms. It predominantly affects obese women of childbearing age. Without treatment, progressive vision loss may occur.",
    "key_points": [
      "Classic patient: obese female of childbearing age with headache and papilledema",
      "Criteria: elevated opening pressure (>25 cm H2O), normal CSF composition, no structural cause on imaging",
      "Visual symptoms: transient visual obscurations, visual field defects (enlarged blind spot, peripheral constriction)",
      "Modified Dandy criteria: papilledema, normal neurologic exam (except CN VI palsy), elevated ICP, normal CSF, no secondary cause",
      "Treatment: weight loss (most effective long-term), acetazolamide, surgical options for refractory cases",
      "Monitoring: serial visual field testing and fundoscopy to detect progression"
    ],
    "statement": "IIH is a potentially blinding condition requiring prompt recognition and treatment. The primary goal is preservation of vision through reduction of intracranial pressure and weight loss.",
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Elevated ICP without a mass lesion creates symptoms through pressure on pain-sensitive structures (headache) and compression of the optic nerve (papilledema, visual loss). The mechanism is thought to involve impaired CSF absorption at arachnoid granulations, possibly related to increased intracranial venous pressure.",
      "key_insight": "Despite being called 'benign,' IIH can cause permanent vision loss. Visual field testing, not headache severity, guides treatment urgency. Fulminant IIH with rapid vision loss requires emergent intervention.",
      "technical_details": "Opening pressure on LP: normal <20 cm H2O (adults); IIH >25 cm H2O. MRI findings: empty sella, flattening of posterior globe, distension of optic nerve sheath, transverse sinus stenosis. Visual field defects: enlarged blind spot (earliest), peripheral constriction, nasal step."

      "papilledema": "Optic disc swelling due to elevated ICP; bilateral; indicates risk of vision loss",
      "transient_visual_obscurations": "Brief episodes of vision loss lasting seconds, often with posture change; classic IIH symptom",

  "clinical_features": {
    "pathophysiology": {
      "mechanism": "The exact mechanism is unknown. Proposed theories include: (1) Reduced CSF absorption at arachnoid granulations, (2) Increased intracranial venous pressure (transverse sinus stenosis), (3) Abnormal CSF dynamics. Obesity and weight gain are strongly associated, possibly through increased intrathoracic/intra-abdominal pressure affecting venous drainage. Elevated ICP transmits along optic nerve sheath, causing papilledema and axonal damage.",
      "key_pathways": [
        "Obesity/weight gain → increased intracranial venous pressure → impaired CSF absorption",
        "Impaired CSF absorption → elevated ICP",
        "Elevated ICP → transmitted to optic nerve sheath → papilledema",
        "Chronic papilledema → axonal damage → progressive visual field loss"
      ],
      "clinical_significance": "Untreated IIH can cause permanent vision loss. Risk factors for poor visual outcome: male sex, African American race, severe papilledema, anemia, sleep apnea. Weight loss of 5-10% can be curative."
