    "summary": "The neurophysiology of sleep stages, adenosine clearance, and evidence-based protocols for brief naps that restore cognitive function",
    "key_points": [
      "Optimal brief nap duration: 10-20 minutes (avoids deep sleep and sleep inertia)",
      "Sleep architecture: NREM Stage 1-2 provides cognitive benefit without deep sleep entry",
      "Benefits appear immediately upon waking with minimal grogginess",
      "NASA study: 26-minute nap improved pilot performance by 34% and alertness by 54%",
      "Naps reduce cortisol and blood pressure; improve mood and creativity",
      "Best timing: early afternoon (1-3 PM) aligns with natural circadian dip",
      "Longer naps (30+ min) risk sleep inertia - impaired function upon waking"
    ],
    "statement": {
      "text": "Strategic brief napping (10-20 minutes) provides cognitive restoration by allowing progression through NREM Stage 1-2 sleep without entering slow-wave sleep. This duration maximizes benefits (improved alertness, memory, mood) through adenosine clearance while avoiding sleep inertia. Understanding sleep architecture enables optimization of nap protocols.",
      "formal": "Power Nap (10-20 min) → Stage 1-2 NREM → Adenosine Clearance → Cognitive Restoration + Alertness ↑ + No Sleep Inertia"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "A strategic nap is like a quick reboot for your brain. Just as restarting a sluggish computer clears memory issues and improves performance, a brief nap clears adenosine (the tiredness chemical) and refreshes neural circuits. The trick is waking before you fall into deep sleep, which would make you groggy.",
      "key_insight": "Sleep inertia (post-nap grogginess) is the key variable. Naps under 20 minutes stay in light sleep stages and allow quick rebound. Once you cross into slow-wave deep sleep (~30+ minutes), you'll feel worse before you feel better. The 15-20 minute sweet spot gives maximum benefit with minimum cost."
