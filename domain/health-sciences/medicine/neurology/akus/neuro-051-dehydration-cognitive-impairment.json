      "intuition": "Think of your brain like a computer - it needs adequate cooling (blood flow) and the right chemical environment to process efficiently. Water is the medium for all brain chemistry. When dehydrated, neurons work harder to accomplish the same tasks, leading to mental fatigue and reduced performance.",
