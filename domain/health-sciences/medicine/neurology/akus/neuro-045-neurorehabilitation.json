    "summary": "Neurorehabilitation is a multidisciplinary approach to maximize functional recovery after neurological injury. It encompasses physical, occupational, speech, and cognitive therapy tailored to specific deficits. Neuroplasticity forms the biological basis for recovery, with intensive, task-specific, repetitive practice driving neural reorganization and functional improvement.",
    "key_points": [
      "Multidisciplinary team: PT, OT, SLP, neuropsychology, nursing, social work",
      "Neuroplasticity: Neural reorganization enables recovery; use-dependent plasticity",
      "Intensity matters: More therapy hours correlate with better outcomes",
      "Task-specific training: Practice functional tasks relevant to daily life",
      "Spasticity management: Stretching, splinting, botulinum toxin, intrathecal baclofen",
      "Constraint-induced movement therapy (CIMT): Restrains unaffected limb to force use of affected limb"
    ],
    "statement": "Neurorehabilitation leverages neuroplasticity through intensive, task-specific, multidisciplinary therapy to maximize functional recovery after stroke, TBI, spinal cord injury, and other neurological conditions.",
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Think of the brain after injury like a city with damaged roads. Neurorehabilitation is like the city rerouting traffic and building new roads around the damage. The more you practice a route (repetitive task-specific training), the better and faster that new road becomes (neuroplasticity). If you don't use it, the road falls into disrepair (use it or lose it).",
      "key_insight": "Recovery follows a predictable time course: most rapid recovery occurs in the first 3 months, with continued but slower gains over 6-12 months. The 'critical period' after injury represents a window of enhanced plasticity. Therapy intensity during this period has the greatest impact on long-term outcomes.",
      "technical_details": "Neuroplasticity mechanisms include: axonal sprouting, unmasking of latent pathways, long-term potentiation, synaptogenesis. Motor learning principles apply: massed vs distributed practice, whole vs part task training, explicit vs implicit learning. Brunnstrom stages describe motor recovery after stroke."
