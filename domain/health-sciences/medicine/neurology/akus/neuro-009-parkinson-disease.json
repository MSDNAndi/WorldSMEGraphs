    "title": "Parkinson Disease",
    "summary": "Parkinson disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder caused by loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta. It presents with the cardinal motor features of bradykinesia, rigidity, resting tremor, and postural instability, along with numerous non-motor symptoms. Treatment centers on dopamine replacement therapy.",
    "key_points": [
      "Cardinal features: Bradykinesia (required) + rest tremor, rigidity, or postural instability",
      "Pathology: Loss of dopaminergic neurons in substantia nigra; Lewy bodies with α-synuclein",
      "Asymmetric onset is typical and supports diagnosis",
      "Non-motor symptoms: REM sleep behavior disorder, anosmia, constipation, depression",
      "Levodopa/carbidopa is most effective treatment; start when functionally impaired",
      "Motor complications (wearing off, dyskinesias) develop after 5-10 years of levodopa"
    ],
    "statement": "Parkinson disease is a progressive dopaminergic neurodegenerative disorder presenting with bradykinesia and other motor/non-motor features, managed with dopamine replacement therapy while addressing motor complications.",
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Think of the brain's motor system as an orchestra where dopamine is the conductor. In Parkinson's, the conductor (dopamine-producing cells) gradually dies, causing the orchestra to play slowly (bradykinesia), stiffly (rigidity), and shakily (tremor). Levodopa temporarily provides a substitute conductor, but over time the remaining musicians become less responsive.",
      "key_insight": "BRADYKINESIA must be present for diagnosis - it's not just slowness but progressive reduction in amplitude and speed with repetitive movements (decrement). A patient with only tremor does NOT have Parkinson disease. Also, response to levodopa is supportive of diagnosis; poor response suggests parkinsonism-plus syndrome.",
      "technical_details": "Symptoms appear when 60-80% of striatal dopamine is lost. Direct pathway (D1) promotes movement; indirect pathway (D2) inhibits. Dopamine loss causes indirect pathway overactivity. α-synuclein aggregates form Lewy bodies and spread in a prion-like manner (Braak staging)."
