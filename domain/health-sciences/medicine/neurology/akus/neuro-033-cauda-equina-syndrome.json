    "title": "Cauda Equina Syndrome",
    "summary": "Cauda equina syndrome (CES) is a neurosurgical emergency caused by compression of the lumbosacral nerve roots below the conus medullaris. It presents with saddle anesthesia, bowel/bladder dysfunction, lower extremity weakness, and low back pain. Urgent surgical decompression within 24 hours provides optimal bladder recovery, with even earlier surgery (6-12 hours) recommended for complete CES.",
    "key_points": [
      "Surgical emergency: Decompression within 24 hours for optimal bladder recovery; earlier for complete CES",
      "Classic presentation: Saddle anesthesia + urinary retention/incontinence + bilateral leg weakness",
      "Most common cause: Large central disc herniation at L4-L5 or L5-S1",
      "Post-void residual >100-200mL indicates bladder dysfunction",
      "MRI lumbar spine is diagnostic; order emergently if CES suspected",
      "Incomplete CES (urinary difficulties) has better prognosis than complete CES (retention)"
    ],
    "statement": "Cauda equina syndrome requires emergent recognition and surgical decompression within 24-48 hours to preserve bowel, bladder, and motor function in this devastating but potentially reversible condition.",
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "The cauda equina ('horse's tail') is where the spinal cord ends and individual nerve roots continue down through the lumbar spine like loose wires in a cable. If something compresses these wires (like a large herniated disc), multiple functions are affected simultaneously - bladder, bowels, legs, and sensation in the 'saddle' area where you'd sit on a horse.",
      "key_insight": "The key to CES is RECOGNIZING IT EARLY. Ask every patient with severe back pain about urinary symptoms, saddle numbness, and bilateral leg symptoms. Urinary RETENTION (can't urinate) is more specific than incontinence. Once bladder function is completely lost, recovery is poor even with surgery - timing is critical.",
      "technical_details": "The conus medullaris ends at L1-L2; below this, only cauda equina nerve roots exist. CES affects S2-S4 roots (bladder, bowel, sexual function, saddle sensation) plus variable lumbar roots (leg weakness/numbness). MRI shows central disc herniation, tumor, abscess, or hematoma compressing nerve roots."
