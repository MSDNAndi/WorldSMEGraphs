      "text": "Huntington disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder caused by CAG trinucleotide repeat expansion in the huntingtin (HTT) gene. It presents with a triad of progressive movement disorder (typically chorea), cognitive decline, and psychiatric disturbance, usually manifesting in mid-adult life. Genetic testing is diagnostic (≥40 CAG repeats = full penetrance). MRI shows characteristic caudate nucleus atrophy. Currently no disease-modifying treatment exists; management is symptomatic with a multidisciplinary approach.",
      "formal": "HD = CAG ≥40 repeats in HTT + (Chorea + Cognitive decline + Psychiatric symptoms) + Autosomal dominant inheritance"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Huntington disease is caused by a 'stutter' in the DNA - the triplet CAG is repeated too many times in the huntingtin gene. The resulting mutant protein is toxic to neurons, especially in the basal ganglia (which controls movement) and cortex (which controls thinking). As these brain areas degenerate over 15-20 years, patients develop uncontrollable dancing movements (chorea), lose cognitive abilities, and often experience depression and behavioral changes.",
      "key_insight": "The phenomenon of genetic anticipation is clinically significant: the CAG repeat can expand when passed from parent to child, especially from fathers. This causes successive generations to develop symptoms at younger ages with more severe disease. Juvenile HD (onset <20 years) has a different phenotype dominated by rigidity rather than chorea, often with faster progression.",
      "technical_details": "The huntingtin protein with expanded polyglutamine tract (polyQ) forms intracellular aggregates that impair normal cellular functions including transcription, mitochondrial function, and protein degradation. Medium spiny neurons in the striatum (caudate and putamen) are particularly vulnerable. Neuropathological grading (Vonsattel grades 0-4) correlates with striatal degeneration severity."
