    "title": "Meniere Disease",
    "summary": "Meniere disease is an inner ear disorder characterized by episodic vertigo, fluctuating sensorineural hearing loss, tinnitus, and aural fullness. It results from endolymphatic hydrops (excess endolymph fluid). Attacks last 20 minutes to 12 hours and recur unpredictably. Management includes dietary sodium restriction, diuretics, and procedures for refractory cases.",
    "key_points": [
      "Classic tetrad: Episodic vertigo (20 min-12 hr) + fluctuating hearing loss + tinnitus + aural fullness",
      "Pathophysiology: Endolymphatic hydrops - excess fluid in endolymphatic compartment",
      "Unilateral initially in most; becomes bilateral in 30-50% over time",
      "Low-frequency sensorineural hearing loss early; progresses to all frequencies",
      "First-line: Low-salt diet (≤2g/day) + thiazide diuretics",
      "Refractory: Intratympanic gentamicin (chemical labyrinthectomy) or surgery"
    ],
    "statement": "Meniere disease is an idiopathic inner ear disorder causing episodic vertigo, hearing loss, tinnitus, and fullness, attributed to endolymphatic hydrops, and managed with salt restriction, diuretics, and interventional procedures for refractory cases.",
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Imagine the inner ear as a water balloon with two fluid compartments. In Meniere's, excess fluid (endolymph) builds up and creates periodic ruptures in the membrane separating these compartments, like pressure waves when a dam bursts. Each rupture causes a vertigo attack, and repeated ruptures progressively damage the hearing and balance organs.",
      "key_insight": "Meniere's causes EPISODIC vertigo (attacks with symptom-free intervals), NOT constant dizziness. The hearing loss FLUCTUATES early in the disease (worse during attacks, improves between) but becomes permanent as the disease progresses. Low-frequency hearing loss is characteristic early.",
      "technical_details": "Endolymphatic hydrops causes distension of Reissner's membrane and ruptures allowing potassium-rich endolymph to mix with perilymph, temporarily paralyzing vestibular and cochlear hair cells. AAO-HNS criteria require ≥2 vertigo episodes (20min-12hr) + audiometrically documented fluctuating sensorineural hearing loss."
