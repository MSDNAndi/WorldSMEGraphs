    "title": "Cluster Headache",
    "summary": "Cluster headache is a trigeminal autonomic cephalalgia characterized by severe unilateral orbital/periorbital pain with ipsilateral autonomic features (lacrimation, conjunctival injection, nasal congestion). Attacks occur in clusters lasting weeks to months, with pain-free remission periods. Treatment involves high-flow oxygen and triptans for acute attacks, with verapamil as first-line prevention.",
    "key_points": [
      "Severe unilateral orbital/periorbital pain lasting 15-180 minutes",
      "Ipsilateral autonomic features: Lacrimation, rhinorrhea, conjunctival injection, ptosis, miosis",
      "Circadian pattern: Attacks often at same time daily, frequently nocturnal",
      "Male predominance (3:1); smoking is major risk factor",
      "Acute: High-flow oxygen (12-15 L/min) or sumatriptan SC/nasal",
      "Prevention: Verapamil first-line; galcanezumab approved for episodic cluster"
    ],
    "statement": "Cluster headache is a severe unilateral headache with autonomic features occurring in clusters, treated acutely with oxygen or triptans and prevented with verapamil.",
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Think of cluster headache as an 'alarm clock' headache that strikes like clockwork at the same time each day during a cluster period. The trigeminal nerve fires causing excruciating pain around the eye, while the parasympathetic system activates causing tearing and nasal congestion. Unlike migraineurs who lie still in dark rooms, cluster patients pace restlessly because movement doesn't worsen the pain.",
      "key_insight": "Cluster headache is often called 'suicide headache' due to its severity. The KEY distinguishing feature is RESTLESSNESS during attacks - patients pace, rock, or bang their heads. Migraineurs prefer to lie still. Also, cluster has IPSILATERAL autonomic features while migraine may have bilateral or no autonomic symptoms.",
      "technical_details": "Hypothalamic activation (posterior hypothalamus) drives circadian periodicity. Trigeminovascular activation causes pain. Parasympathetic activation (superior salivatory nucleus) causes autonomic features. Functional imaging shows ipsilateral posterior hypothalamic activation during attacks."
