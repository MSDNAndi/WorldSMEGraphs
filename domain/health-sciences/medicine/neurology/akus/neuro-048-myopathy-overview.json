    "statement": {
      "text": "Myopathy is a general term for diseases of skeletal muscle characterized by weakness without sensory loss, typically affecting proximal muscles more than distal. Patients present with difficulty climbing stairs, rising from chairs, and reaching overhead. Laboratory evaluation shows elevated creatine kinase, EMG demonstrates myopathic motor units, and muscle biopsy provides definitive diagnosis. Myopathies are classified as inflammatory (treatable), genetic/dystrophic, toxic/metabolic, or endocrine.",
      "formal": "Myopathy = Proximal weakness + Elevated CK + Myopathic EMG + No sensory loss | Classification = Inflammatory | Genetic | Toxic | Endocrine"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "In myopathy, the muscle fibers themselves are damaged or dysfunctional, while the nerves supplying them remain intact. This explains why patients have weakness but no numbness (sensory fibers are fine) and why the largest muscles (proximal, used for big movements) are typically affected first. When muscle cells break down, they release their contents (CK) into the blood, making CK a useful marker.",
      "key_insight": "The proximal > distal weakness pattern is key for distinguishing myopathy from neuropathy (which typically shows distal > proximal). However, some myopathies (like myotonic dystrophy, inclusion body myositis) have distal involvement, so clinical context matters. The combination of weakness pattern, CK level, EMG findings, and muscle biopsy allows accurate classification.",
      "technical_details": "EMG in myopathy shows early recruitment of small, brief, polyphasic motor unit potentials because individual muscle fibers are damaged (reducing motor unit amplitude) but the number of motor units is preserved (early recruitment). Muscle biopsy can distinguish inflammatory (lymphocyte infiltration), dystrophic (fiber size variation, fibrosis), metabolic (storage material), and mitochondrial (ragged red fibers) myopathies."
