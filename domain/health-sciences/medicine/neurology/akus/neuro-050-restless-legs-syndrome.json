    "title": "Restless Legs Syndrome",
    "summary": "Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a sensorimotor disorder characterized by an irresistible urge to move the legs, typically accompanied by uncomfortable sensations that worsen during rest and in the evening/night, and are temporarily relieved by movement. Iron deficiency is a key modifiable factor, and dopamine agonists are first-line treatment.",
    "key_points": [
      "Four essential diagnostic criteria: urge to move legs, worse at rest, relief with movement, circadian pattern",
      "Associated with iron deficiency - check ferritin and treat if <75 μg/L",
      "Dopamine agonists (pramipexole, ropinirole) or alpha-2-delta ligands (gabapentin, pregabalin) are first-line",
      "Augmentation is a major complication of long-term dopaminergic therapy",
      "Strongly associated with periodic limb movements of sleep (PLMS)",
      "Screen for secondary causes: iron deficiency, uremia, pregnancy, neuropathy"
    ],
    "statement": "Restless legs syndrome is a sensorimotor disorder diagnosed by the urge to move the legs accompanied by uncomfortable sensations, circadian worsening in evening/night, symptom provocation by rest, and relief with movement.",
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Imagine trying to sit still while your legs feel like they have 'electricity' running through them. The discomfort is deep, hard to describe, and the only relief is moving. Now imagine this happens every evening when you try to relax or sleep - that's RLS.",
      "key_insight": "RLS is fundamentally a dopamine and iron disorder. Brain iron is essential for dopamine synthesis (iron is a cofactor for tyrosine hydroxylase). Even 'normal' serum ferritin (<75) may indicate brain iron deficiency - hence the higher treatment threshold.",
      "technical_details": "The pathophysiology involves reduced brain iron in substantia nigra and other regions, leading to dopaminergic dysfunction. Spinal cord hyperexcitability contributes to sensory symptoms. PLMS occur in 80-90% of RLS patients and are recorded on polysomnography as repetitive leg movements during sleep."
