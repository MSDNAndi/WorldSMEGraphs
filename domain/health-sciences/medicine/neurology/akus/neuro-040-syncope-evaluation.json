    "title": "Syncope Evaluation",
    "summary": "Syncope is transient loss of consciousness due to cerebral hypoperfusion, with spontaneous complete recovery. Evaluation aims to distinguish benign reflex syncope from potentially life-threatening cardiac syncope. Initial assessment includes history, physical exam with orthostatic vitals, and ECG. Risk stratification guides further workup and disposition.",
    "key_points": [
      "Three categories: Reflex (vasovagal, situational), Orthostatic, Cardiac (most dangerous)",
      "History is most important: Triggers, prodrome, position, witnesses, recovery",
      "ECG in all patients - may reveal arrhythmia or structural heart disease",
      "Cardiac syncope: Exertional, supine, palpitations, family history sudden death",
      "Risk stratification: Age, heart failure, structural heart disease, abnormal ECG",
      "Tilt table test for recurrent unexplained syncope when reflex suspected"
    ],
    "statement": "Syncope evaluation focuses on distinguishing benign reflex syncope from potentially fatal cardiac syncope through history, examination, ECG, and risk stratification to guide appropriate workup and management.",
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Think of syncope as the brain's 'power outage' from not getting enough blood. The key question is: why did the power go out? Was it a simple blown fuse (vasovagal - blood vessels dilated too much) or is there a problem with the main generator (heart arrhythmia or structural disease)?",
      "key_insight": "HISTORY is the most powerful diagnostic tool - 45% of cases diagnosed by history alone. Key features: What was the patient doing (standing, exertion, supine)? Were there prodromal symptoms (warmth, nausea = vasovagal)? Witness account of duration and any convulsive movements (prolonged syncope can cause brief 'convulsive syncope').",
      "technical_details": "Syncope requires transient global cerebral hypoperfusion. Mean arterial pressure drops to ~60mmHg or cerebral perfusion stops for 6-8 seconds to cause LOC. Reflex syncope involves cardioinhibitory (bradycardia) and/or vasodepressor (hypotension) responses. Cardiac output = stroke volume × heart rate; cardiac syncope results from sudden drop in either."
