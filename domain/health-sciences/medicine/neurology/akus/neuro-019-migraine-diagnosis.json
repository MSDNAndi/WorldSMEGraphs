    "summary": "Migraine is a primary headache disorder characterized by recurrent episodes of moderate-to-severe, typically unilateral pulsating headache lasting 4-72 hours, accompanied by nausea, photophobia, and/or phonophobia. Diagnosis is clinical using ICHD-3 criteria. Migraine with aura includes reversible neurological symptoms preceding or accompanying the headache.",
    "key_points": [
      "ICHD-3 criteria: ≥5 attacks lasting 4-72 hours with specific features",
      "Unilateral location, pulsating quality, moderate-severe intensity, aggravation by activity",
      "Associated with nausea/vomiting and/or photophobia + phonophobia",
      "Aura: reversible visual, sensory, or speech symptoms (typically 5-60 min)",
      "Red flags (SNOOP) require neuroimaging to exclude secondary causes",
      "Affects 15% of population; 3:1 female predominance"
    ],
    "statement": "Migraine is a primary neurovascular headache disorder diagnosed clinically by characteristic attack features including unilateral pulsating pain, duration 4-72 hours, and associated autonomic symptoms, with or without preceding aura.",
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Think of migraine as a 'brain electrical storm' that sensitizes pain pathways. The trigeminal system becomes hyperexcitable, releasing neuropeptides (CGRP) that cause neurogenic inflammation and vasodilation. The brain essentially misinterprets normal signals as painful.",
      "key_insight": "Migraine is NOT just a headache - it's a complex neurological disorder with prodrome (hours before), aura (if present), headache, and postdrome phases. Understanding the full attack helps with early treatment and recognition of atypical presentations.",
      "technical_details": "Cortical spreading depression (CSD) underlies aura - a wave of neuronal depolarization followed by suppression spreading across cortex at 2-5mm/min. CSD activates trigeminal afferents, releasing CGRP and causing central sensitization. Triptans work by 5-HT1B/1D agonism, causing vasoconstriction and inhibiting neuropeptide release."
