      "text": "Transient ischemic attack (TIA) is a transient episode of neurologic dysfunction caused by focal brain, spinal cord, or retinal ischemia without acute infarction. TIA is a warning sign with high short-term stroke risk (5-10% at 48 hours), requiring urgent evaluation and secondary prevention.",

    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "A TIA is like a 'warning stroke' - the brain briefly loses blood supply but recovers before permanent damage. The danger is that the same mechanism (clot, stenosis) that caused the TIA can cause a complete stroke soon after.",
      "key_insight": "The old definition (symptoms <24 hours) is outdated. Modern imaging shows many patients with brief symptoms still have DWI-positive infarcts. The new tissue-based definition focuses on whether there's permanent injury, regardless of symptom duration."
