    "title": "Alzheimer Disease",
    "summary": "Alzheimer disease is the most common cause of dementia, characterized by insidious onset of memory impairment (especially episodic memory) followed by progressive decline in other cognitive domains. Pathologically defined by amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, it has limited but meaningful symptomatic treatments and is a focus of intensive disease-modifying therapy research.",
    "key_points": [
      "Most common cause of dementia (60-80% of cases)",
      "Hallmark: early episodic memory loss with preserved remote memory initially",
      "Pathology: amyloid-beta plaques (extracellular) and tau tangles (intracellular)",
      "APOE ε4 allele is strongest genetic risk factor for late-onset AD",
      "Diagnosis primarily clinical; biomarkers (CSF, PET) increasingly used",

      "Memantine (NMDA antagonist) for moderate-severe disease",
      "New anti-amyloid therapies (aducanumab, lecanemab) for early disease"
    ],
    "statement": "Alzheimer disease represents a major public health challenge as populations age worldwide. Understanding its clinical presentation, pathophysiology, and management is essential for all clinicians, as early recognition allows for symptomatic treatment, advance care planning, and potential enrollment in disease-modifying therapy trials.",
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Think of Alzheimer disease as a 'filing cabinet' problem in the brain. The hippocampus, which files new memories, is affected early, so patients can't form new memories (anterograde amnesia) even though old memories filed long ago remain accessible. As the disease spreads, other brain functions fail progressively.",
      "key_insight": "The amyloid cascade hypothesis suggests that accumulation of amyloid-beta initiates a cascade leading to tau pathology, neuroinflammation, synaptic dysfunction, and neuronal death. While amyloid-targeting therapies have shown plaque clearance, clinical benefit remains modest, suggesting the pathophysiology is more complex than initially thought.",
      "technical_details": "Amyloid precursor protein (APP) is cleaved by β-secretase and γ-secretase to produce amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptides. Aβ42 is particularly prone to aggregation into oligomers and fibrils. Tau is a microtubule-associated protein; hyperphosphorylation causes it to aggregate into neurofibrillary tangles. The spreading pattern of tau pathology (Braak staging) correlates better with clinical symptoms than amyloid burden."
