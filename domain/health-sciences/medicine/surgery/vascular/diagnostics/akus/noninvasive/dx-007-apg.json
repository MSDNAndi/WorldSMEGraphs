    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "APG wraps an air-filled cuff around your calf to measure how much it swells and shrinks with different positions and exercise. This tells us how well blood drains from the leg and how effectively the muscle pump works.",
      "key_insight": "APG provides functional venous assessment that duplex cannot: it measures the net effect of reflux AND obstruction AND muscle pump on venous hemodynamics. The venous filling index (VFI) is the key reflux parameter.",
      "technical_details": "Technique: calibrated air cuff on calf, measure volume changes. Parameters: (1) Venous Volume (VV) - total venous capacity, (2) Venous Filling Index (VFI) - reflux severity (normal <2mL/sec, severe >7mL/sec), (3) Ejection Fraction (EF) - calf pump function (normal >60%), (4) Residual Volume Fraction (RVF) - ambulatory venous pressure (normal <35%). Indications: quantifying severity, assessing treatment outcomes, evaluating mixed disease."
