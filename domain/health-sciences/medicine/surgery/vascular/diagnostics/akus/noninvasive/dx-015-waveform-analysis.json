      "text": "Doppler waveform analysis classifies arterial flow patterns as triphasic (normal), biphasic (mild disease or normal distal vessels), or monophasic (significant proximal disease), based on the presence or absence of flow reversal and forward diastolic flow components, providing qualitative assessment of vascular hemodynamics.",
      "formal": "Waveform: Triphasic(Systole + Reversal + Diastole) → Biphasic(Systole + Diastole) → Monophasic(Continuous_Forward)"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "A normal artery pulse has three parts to its wave: a sharp forward push (systole), a brief backward flow (reversal from vessel recoil), and a small forward flow (diastole). As arteries get blocked, the wave changes - first losing the reversal (biphasic), then becoming a flat continuous flow (monophasic).",
      "key_insight": "The loss of flow reversal indicates either disease proximal to the sampling site OR high resistance distal bed. Context matters: biphasic in the common femoral suggests inflow disease; biphasic in distal vessels is often normal. Monophasic waveforms with low velocity indicate severe disease requiring intervention.",
      "technical_details": "Triphasic waveform: rapid systolic upstroke, brief early diastolic flow reversal (caused by peripheral resistance and elastic recoil), forward diastolic flow (compliant vessel capacitance). Normal in high-resistance beds (limb arteries at rest). Biphasic: loss of reversal component; seen in mild-moderate disease OR in low-resistance beds (post-exercise, distal arteries, after vasodilation). Monophasic: continuous forward flow, no reversal; indicates significant proximal stenosis/occlusion causing arterial damping. Additional features: spectral broadening (turbulence), tardus-parvus (delayed upstroke, reduced amplitude distal to stenosis), high-velocity jets at stenosis site."
