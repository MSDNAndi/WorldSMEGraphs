    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "PPG shines a light into your skin and measures how much bounces back. When blood pulses through, the amount of light absorbed changes. This creates a wave pattern that tells us about blood flow to the digits.",
      "key_insight": "PPG-derived toe pressures are invaluable when ankle pressures are falsely elevated due to medial arterial calcification (common in diabetics). Toe pressure >30mmHg suggests adequate perfusion for healing.",
      "technical_details": "Mechanism: LED emits infrared light (940nm), photodetector measures reflected light which varies with blood volume. Applications: (1) Waveform analysis - normal vs blunted vs flat, (2) Toe systolic pressure with cuff occlusion, (3) Venous reflux evaluation. Toe pressure: place cuff on proximal phalanx, inflate until PPG signal lost, deflate until signal returns. Normal toe pressure >70% of brachial. Healing threshold: >30mmHg."
