      "text": "Pulse volume recording (PVR) is a noninvasive plethysmographic technique that measures volume changes in the limb with each cardiac cycle using air-filled cuffs, generating waveforms that assess arterial perfusion quality and localize disease levels independent of vessel calcification.",
      "formal": "PVR = Air_Plethysmography + Volume_Changes + Waveform_Analysis + Calcification_Independent"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "PVR is like taking the blood pressure cuff principle and using it to measure how much the leg swells with each heartbeat. A healthy artery makes a nice sharp wave; a blocked artery makes a flat, rounded wave. Unlike ABI, it works even when arteries are heavily calcified.",
      "key_insight": "PVR is invaluable in diabetic and dialysis patients with calcified arteries where ABI is falsely elevated. The waveform morphology (rather than just the amplitude) provides qualitative assessment of proximal inflow. PVR at multiple levels (thigh, calf, ankle, digit) localizes disease to specific segments.",
      "technical_details": "Air-filled cuffs are placed at standardized levels (high thigh, above knee, below knee, ankle, metatarsal, digit). Cuffs are inflated to 65 mmHg to sense limb volume changes. Normal waveform: rapid upslope, sharp peak (dicrotic notch on downslope), amplitude >15mm at chart speed 25mm/sec. Abnormal patterns: loss of dicrotic notch (mild), flattened peak (moderate), flattened and delayed (severe), flat (critical/occluded). Amplitude <5mm indicates severe disease. Advantages: not affected by calcification (measures volume, not pressure), qualitative assessment of waveform, localizes disease level. Limitations: qualitative, operator-dependent, affected by cardiac output."
