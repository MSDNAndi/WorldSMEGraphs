    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "SPP answers the question: how hard do you have to push on the skin to stop blood from flowing? If blood flow resumes even with light pressure (high SPP), the skin has good perfusion and will likely heal.",
      "key_insight": "SPP directly measures skin microcirculation, making it more predictive of wound healing than proximal pressures (ABI/toe pressure). It is particularly valuable for amputation level selection and predicting surgical site healing.",
      "technical_details": "Technique: laser Doppler probe placed on skin, blood pressure cuff proximal, inflate to occlude then slowly deflate. SPP = pressure at which laser Doppler signal returns. Normal: >50mmHg. Healing thresholds: >40mmHg generally heals, 30-40mmHg borderline, <30mmHg unlikely without revascularization. Advantages: unaffected by vessel calcification, measures actual skin perfusion. Limitations: operator dependent, affected by edema, requires specialized equipment."
