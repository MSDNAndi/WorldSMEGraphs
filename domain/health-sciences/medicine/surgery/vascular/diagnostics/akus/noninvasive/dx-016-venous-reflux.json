    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "To check if vein valves work, you squeeze the calf to push blood up, then release and watch if it flows backward. Normal valves snap shut in less than half a second. Incompetent valves let blood fall back down, creating prolonged reverse flow.",
      "key_insight": "Reflux duration thresholds differ by vein type. Superficial veins (GSV/SSV) use 0.5 second cutoff while deep veins use 1.0 second because deep veins normally have longer valve closure times.",
      "technical_details": "Technique: patient standing, duplex probe on vein segment, elicit reflux by calf compression release or Valsalva (proximal segments). Measure: peak reflux velocity, reflux duration. Thresholds: superficial veins >0.5 sec, deep veins >1.0 sec, perforators >0.5 sec with diameter >3.5mm. Severity: correlates with reflux duration and number of segments involved. Documentation: map all incompetent segments for treatment planning."
