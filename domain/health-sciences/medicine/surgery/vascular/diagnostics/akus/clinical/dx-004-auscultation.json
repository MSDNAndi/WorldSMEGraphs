      "text": "Vascular auscultation detects bruits caused by turbulent blood flow through stenotic arteries, with bruit presence generally indicating 50-90% stenosis, though absence does not exclude significant disease.",
      "formal": "Bruit: Turbulent_Flow → Audible_Sound → Stenosis 50-90%"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "A bruit is the sound of blood rushing through a narrowed pipe - like water whistling through a kinked garden hose. You hear it when there's enough narrowing to cause turbulence but not so much that flow stops completely.",
      "key_insight": "Bruits disappear with very tight stenosis (>95%) because flow is too slow to generate turbulence. A previous bruit that disappears may indicate disease progression, not improvement.",
      "technical_details": "Locations: carotid bifurcation, supraclavicular (subclavian), periumbilical (aorta/visceral), flank (renal), groin (femoral). Technique: light pressure with diaphragm, quiet room. Characteristics: timing (systolic vs continuous), pitch, radiation. Sensitivity: 60-70% for significant stenosis. Pitfalls: transmitted cardiac murmurs, venous hums, normal transmitted sounds in thin patients."
