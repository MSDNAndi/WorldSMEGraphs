    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Taking a vascular history is like detective work - you're gathering clues about blood flow problems. The pattern of symptoms (where, when, what makes it better/worse) points to whether the problem is arterial, venous, or lymphatic.",
      "key_insight": "Classic claudication is reproducible at a consistent walking distance, relieved by rest (not position change), and indicates arterial disease. Venous claudication is a bursting sensation relieved by elevation. Neurogenic claudication requires sitting (not just stopping) for relief.",
      "technical_details": "Arterial symptoms: claudication (walking distance, incline effect), rest pain (hanging leg over bed), tissue loss. Venous symptoms: heaviness, swelling worse with standing, relief with elevation. Risk factors: smoking, diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, family history. Functional assessment: impact on work, hobbies, daily activities. Previous interventions: prior bypass, angioplasty, amputations. Medications: antiplatelets, anticoagulants, statins, claudication drugs."
