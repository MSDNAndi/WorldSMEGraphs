      "text": "Systematic pulse examination is the cornerstone of vascular assessment, evaluating arterial flow at standardized anatomic locations using palpation graded 0-4, with comparison to contralateral pulses and integration with Doppler assessment to characterize peripheral arterial disease severity and localize occlusions.",
      "formal": "Pulse_Exam = Palpation(Bilateral_Comparison) + Grading(0-4) + Doppler_Confirmation"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Checking pulses is like testing water pressure at different points along a plumbing system. If the pulse is weak or absent at a certain point, there's likely a blockage upstream. By checking pulses at multiple levels and comparing sides, you can map where the blockages are.",
      "key_insight": "Pulse examination has limitations - 25-30% interobserver variability and difficulty in edematous or obese patients. Always confirm with handheld Doppler and ankle-brachial index. A 'palpable pulse' does not exclude significant stenosis; Doppler waveform quality provides additional information.",
      "technical_details": "Standard pulse locations: radial (lateral wrist), ulnar (medial wrist), brachial (antecubital fossa), carotid (sternocleidomastoid border), femoral (below inguinal ligament at mid-point), popliteal (popliteal fossa with knee flexed), dorsalis pedis (lateral to EHL tendon), posterior tibial (posterior to medial malleolus). Grading: 0 = absent, 1+ = diminished (barely palpable), 2+ = normal, 3+ = increased, 4+ = bounding (aneurysmal). Absent dorsalis pedis is normal variant in 5-10%. Temperature and capillary refill supplement assessment. Handheld Doppler signals: triphasic (normal), biphasic (mild-moderate disease), monophasic (severe disease), absent (occlusion)."
