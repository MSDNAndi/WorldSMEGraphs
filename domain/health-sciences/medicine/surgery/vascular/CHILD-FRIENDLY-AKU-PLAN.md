## Implementation Notes

### Cross-Domain References

Each AKU should reference:
- **Native domain**: health-sciences/medicine/surgery/vascular
- **Cross-domain applications**: 
  - Education/early-childhood (teaching methods)
  - Psychology/child-development (age-appropriate explanations)

### Audience Level Specifications

**4-year-old level**:
- Very simple sentences (3-5 words)
- Concrete examples only
- Heavy use of analogies to familiar objects
- No abstract concepts
- Lots of repetition

**Child level (5-6)**:
- Simple sentences (5-10 words)
- Can handle slightly more complex ideas
- Still needs analogies
- Can understand simple cause-and-effect
- Beginning to grasp how things work

### Visual Requirements

Every AKU must include:
1. **Simple diagram** - Bright colors, minimal detail
2. **Analogy visual** - Showing the comparison (e.g., roads for vessels)
3. **Character illustration** - Child or friendly doctor
4. **Safety note** - Nothing scary or clinical

### Language Guidelines

**DO use**:
- Simple words (blood, tube, pump, road)
- Familiar comparisons (toys, roads, garden hose)
- Active voice ("The heart pumps blood")
- Positive framing ("Doctors help fix it!")

**DON'T use**:
- Medical jargon (cardiovascular, endovascular)
- Scary words (surgery, operation, needle)
- Passive voice
- Negative framing (disease, sick, hurt)

### Cultural Sensitivity

- Show diverse representation in illustrations
- Use universally understood analogies
- Avoid culture-specific references except in localized versions
- Include both male and female medical professionals

### Assessment Methods

For each AKU, children should be able to:
1. **Recall**: What did we learn about?
2. **Recognize**: Point to the blood vessel in a picture
3. **Apply**: Match healthy habits to happy bodies
4. **Create**: Draw a simple heart with vessels

- Age 18+: "Cardiovascular system anatomy and physiology"

### Cross-References to Adult AKUs

Each child AKU should link to:
- Corresponding adult-level concept
- Note: "For detailed medical information, see AKU-XXX"
- Parent/teacher resources with full medical details
