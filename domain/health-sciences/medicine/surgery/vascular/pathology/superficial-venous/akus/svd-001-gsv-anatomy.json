    "definition": {
      "formal": "The great saphenous vein (GSV) is the longest vein in the body, extending from the dorsum of the foot to the saphenofemoral junction in the groin. It courses through the saphenous compartment within a defined fascial envelope and serves as the major superficial venous drainage of the medial leg.",
      "clinical": "The main superficial vein on the inside of the leg, running from ankle to groin. It's the most commonly treated vein for varicose veins and the preferred conduit for bypass surgery."
    },
    "core_concepts": [
      {
        "concept": "Course and Relationships",
        "explanation": "The GSV originates from the dorsal venous arch of the foot, passes anterior to the medial malleolus, ascends the medial calf, crosses the knee joint posteriorly and medially, and ascends the medial thigh to terminate at the saphenofemoral junction (SFJ) in the cribriform fascia.",
        "clinical_significance": "Understanding the course is essential for ablation procedures. The GSV lies within the saphenous compartment between two fascial layers (saphenous fascia and muscular fascia)."
      },
      {
        "concept": "Saphenofemoral Junction",
        "explanation": "The SFJ is located approximately 3-4 cm inferolateral to the pubic tubercle. The GSV drains into the common femoral vein. Tributaries joining near the SFJ include the superficial epigastric, superficial circumflex iliac, and external pudendal veins.",
        "clinical_significance": "Competence of the SFJ is assessed with duplex. Reflux at the SFJ is the most common source of varicose veins. Treatment must address the junction to prevent recurrence."
      },
      {
        "concept": "Saphenous Compartment (Egyptian Eye Sign)",
        "explanation": "On ultrasound, the GSV appears within a triangular fascial compartment - the 'saphenous eye' or 'Egyptian eye' - bounded by the saphenous fascia superficially and muscular fascia deep. This identifies the true GSV from accessory saphenous veins.",
        "clinical_significance": "Ultrasound identification of the saphenous eye confirms you are imaging the GSV, not an accessory vein or tributary."
      },
      {
        "concept": "Tributaries and Variations",
        "explanation": "Major tributaries include the anterior accessory saphenous vein (AASV) and posterior accessory saphenous vein (PASV). The Giacomini vein connects the GSV to the SSV in the posterior thigh. Anatomic variations are common.",
        "clinical_significance": "Tributaries may be independent sources of reflux even if GSV is competent. Mapping identifies which veins need treatment."
      },
      {
        "concept": "Relationship to Saphenous Nerve",
        "explanation": "The saphenous nerve runs adjacent to the GSV in the lower leg, particularly below the knee. At the medial malleolus, the nerve and vein are in very close proximity.",
        "clinical_significance": "Thermal ablation in the calf risks saphenous nerve injury. Foam sclerotherapy or phlebectomy may be preferred below knee."
      },
      {
        "concept": "GSV as Bypass Conduit",
        "explanation": "The GSV is the gold standard conduit for infrainguinal arterial bypass and coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). Minimum usable diameter is typically 3-3.5 mm. The vein is harvested and may be used reversed or in situ.",
        "clinical_significance": "A patient's GSV may need to be preserved if future bypass is anticipated. Ablation removes the vein as a conduit option."
