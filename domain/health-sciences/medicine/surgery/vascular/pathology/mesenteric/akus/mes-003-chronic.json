    "statement": {
      "text": "Chronic mesenteric ischemia (intestinal angina) results from atherosclerotic stenosis of mesenteric arteries, classically presenting with postprandial abdominal pain (intestinal angina), food fear, and significant weight loss, typically requiring two of three mesenteric vessels to be severely stenosed before symptoms occur due to extensive collateralization.",
      "formal": "CMI = Postprandial_Pain + Food_Fear + Weight_Loss + Multi_Vessel_Stenosis + Revascularization_Benefits"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "The intestines need a lot of blood after eating to digest food. If the blood supply arteries are narrowed, eating causes pain - like angina of the heart but in the belly. Patients learn to fear food because eating hurts, so they lose a lot of weight. Unlike the heart, the gut has great backup blood supplies, so you usually need blockages in multiple arteries before symptoms start.",
      "key_insight": "The key clinical pearl: CMI typically requires stenosis of at least 2 of 3 mesenteric vessels (celiac, SMA, IMA) due to excellent collateral networks (meandering mesenteric artery, arc of Riolan, pancreaticoduodenal arcades). Single-vessel disease rarely causes symptoms unless collaterals are compromised. SMA is the most important - treat first.",
      "technical_details": "Pathophysiology: atherosclerotic stenosis at ostia → inability to meet postprandial metabolic demand → mucosal ischemia → pain. Classic triad: (1) postprandial pain (within 30-60 min of eating), (2) food fear/sitophobia (patients eat less to avoid pain), (3) significant weight loss (often >20 lbs). Differential: pancreatic cancer, peptic ulcer, gastroparesis. Diagnosis: mesenteric duplex (fasting PSV: celiac >200, SMA >275 suggests >70% stenosis), CTA/MRA for anatomy. Treatment: SMA revascularization is priority (stent preferred if anatomy suitable, bypass if endovascular fails). Celiac stenting controversial due to MAL compression. Outcomes: symptom relief 85-95%, 5-year patency 50-80% for stent, 80-90% for bypass."
