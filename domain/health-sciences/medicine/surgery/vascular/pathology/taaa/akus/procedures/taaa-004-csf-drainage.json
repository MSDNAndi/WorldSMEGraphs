    "statement": {
      "text": "Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) drainage is a critical spinal cord protection strategy during thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm repair and thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR). By reducing CSF pressure through a lumbar catheter, the technique increases spinal cord perfusion pressure (SCPP = MAP - CSF pressure), thereby improving blood flow to the vulnerable spinal cord during periods of reduced or absent intercostal/lumbar artery perfusion. CSF drainage reduces the incidence of spinal cord ischemia by approximately 50% and is considered standard of care for high-risk aortic procedures.",
      "formal": "CSF Drainage: Lumbar drain placed at L3-L4, maintaining CSF pressure ≤10 mmHg (drain volume ≤20 mL/hr), combined with MAP augmentation (>80-90 mmHg) to optimize SCPP = MAP - CSF pressure."
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "The spinal cord sits in a fluid-filled sac (the dura) within the spinal canal. When blood flow to the cord is reduced during aortic surgery, the pressure of this fluid (CSF) can act like a tourniquet, further reducing perfusion. By draining some of this fluid through a small catheter, we effectively 'release the tourniquet' and allow more blood to reach the cord. Think of it like relieving pressure in a garden hose by opening a valve - the water (blood) can flow more easily to where it needs to go.",
      "key_insight": "Spinal cord perfusion pressure (SCPP) is analogous to cerebral perfusion pressure: SCPP = MAP - CSF pressure. By reducing the CSF pressure component (normally 10-15 mmHg, often elevated with edema/ischemia) while simultaneously maintaining/augmenting MAP, we can maintain adequate SCPP even when direct arterial supply is compromised.",
      "technical_details": "Lumbar drains are typically placed preoperatively at L3-L4 or L4-L5 using standard sterile technique. Target CSF pressure is ≤10 mmHg, achieved by passive gravity drainage to a level set 10 cm above the external auditory meatus (or using pressure-regulated systems). Drainage is limited to ≤20 mL/hour and ≤250 mL/24 hours to prevent subdural hematoma. Post-operatively, MAP is augmented to 80-90 mmHg (or higher if neurologic symptoms develop) for 48-72 hours. The drain is typically removed by 72 hours if neurologic status is stable, after gradual clamping to assess for symptoms."
