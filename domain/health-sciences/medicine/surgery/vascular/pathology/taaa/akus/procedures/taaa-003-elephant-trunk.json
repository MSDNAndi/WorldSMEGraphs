    "statement": {
      "text": "The Elephant Trunk technique is a staged surgical approach for extensive aortic pathology involving the ascending aorta, arch, and descending/thoracoabdominal aorta. In Stage 1, the ascending aorta and arch are replaced with a graft that includes a 'trunk' extending into the proximal descending aorta. Stage 2 completes the repair by anastomosing to this trunk, eliminating the need for a dangerous cross-clamp on the diseased descending aorta. The Frozen Elephant Trunk (FET) modification incorporates a stent-graft component that deploys into the descending aorta, potentially completing repair in a single stage or facilitating subsequent TEVAR.",
      "formal": "Elephant Trunk: Stage 1 = ascending/arch replacement with free-floating graft extension into descending aorta. Stage 2 = anastomosis to trunk for thoracoabdominal completion. FET = hybrid graft with stent component for single-stage or facilitated second-stage."
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Imagine trying to sew a long water pipe that's damaged along its entire length. Clamping the middle section to work on it while both ends are diseased is extremely dangerous. The Elephant Trunk technique is like installing the pipe in two phases: first, you replace the upper section and leave a piece hanging into the lower section (like an elephant's trunk hanging down). When you come back to fix the lower section, you simply sew onto the healthy trunk rather than clamping diseased pipe.",
      "key_insight": "The primary benefit is transforming a high-risk single-stage operation into two lower-risk procedures, with an interval allowing development of collateral spinal cord circulation. The 'trunk' eliminates the need to cross-clamp the diseased proximal descending aorta during Stage 2, a particularly hazardous maneuver in aneurysmal or dissected tissue.",
      "technical_details": "Stage 1 is performed via median sternotomy under hypothermic circulatory arrest (HCA) with or without selective antegrade cerebral perfusion (SACP). The ascending aorta and arch are replaced with a Dacron graft, and the distal anastomosis includes invaginating extra graft length (10-15 cm) into the descending aorta, which floats freely. After 4-8 weeks (allowing adhesion formation and collateral development), Stage 2 thoracoabdominal repair is performed. The trunk is retrieved via left thoracoabdominal incision, and the graft is extended distally. The Frozen Elephant Trunk (E-vita, Thoraflex) incorporates a stent-graft that deploys into the descending aorta, either completing the repair or creating an optimal landing zone for subsequent TEVAR."
