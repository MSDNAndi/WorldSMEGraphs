    "definition": {
      "formal": "The CEAP classification is a standardized descriptive system for chronic venous disorders that categorizes disease based on Clinical manifestations (C), Etiology (E), Anatomic distribution (A), and Pathophysiology (P). It provides a uniform language for describing the full spectrum of chronic venous disease.",
      "clinical": "A comprehensive scoring system that helps clinicians describe exactly what venous disease a patient has, why they have it, where it is located, and what's wrong physiologically - enabling consistent communication and treatment planning."
    },
    "core_concepts": [
      {
        "concept": "Clinical Classification (C0-C6)",
        "explanation": "Describes the visible and palpable signs of venous disease. C0: No visible signs. C1: Telangiectasias or reticular veins. C2: Varicose veins. C3: Edema. C4a: Pigmentation or eczema. C4b: Lipodermatosclerosis or atrophie blanche. C5: Healed venous ulcer. C6: Active venous ulcer.",
        "clinical_significance": "The C class drives treatment decisions and prognostication. C4b-C6 represent severe disease requiring aggressive intervention."
      },
      {
        "concept": "Symptomatic Modifier (s/a)",
        "explanation": "Each clinical class is followed by 's' for symptomatic or 'a' for asymptomatic. Symptoms include aching, pain, heaviness, fatigue, itching, throbbing, or cramping attributable to venous disease.",
        "clinical_significance": "A patient with C2s has symptomatic varicose veins - important distinction for treatment indication."
      },
      {
        "concept": "Etiologic Classification (E)",
        "explanation": "Ec: Congenital (present from birth). Ep: Primary (cause unknown, presumed valve failure). Es: Secondary (post-thrombotic, post-traumatic). En: No venous cause identified.",
        "clinical_significance": "Secondary (Es) disease from prior DVT has worse prognosis and different treatment implications than primary reflux."
      },
      {
        "concept": "Anatomic Classification (A)",
        "explanation": "As: Superficial veins (GSV, SSV, tributaries). Ap: Perforating veins. Ad: Deep veins. An: No venous location identified. Can be combined when multiple systems involved.",
        "clinical_significance": "Guides intervention choice - superficial reflux is easily treatable; deep reflux is more challenging."
      },
      {
        "concept": "Pathophysiologic Classification (P)",
        "explanation": "Pr: Reflux (valve incompetence). Po: Obstruction (venous narrowing or occlusion). Pro: Reflux and obstruction. Pn: No venous pathophysiology identified.",
        "clinical_significance": "Distinguishes between reflux (most common, treatable by ablation) and obstruction (may require stenting or bypass)."

      {
        "concept": "Full CEAP Notation",
        "explanation": "Complete classification uses all components. Example: C4b,s,Ep,As,p,Pr - symptomatic lipodermatosclerosis from primary disease with superficial and perforator reflux.",
        "clinical_significance": "Full notation provides complete disease description but is cumbersome for routine use. Basic CEAP (C class only) is often sufficient."
