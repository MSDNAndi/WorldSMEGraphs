    "statement": {
      "text": "Type B aortic dissection is initially managed medically with anti-impulse therapy (beta-blockers to reduce heart rate and blood pressure) unless complications arise. Complicated Type B dissection (malperfusion, rupture, refractory pain/hypertension, rapid expansion) requires urgent intervention, typically TEVAR. Uncomplicated Type B has 10% in-hospital mortality with medical therapy; complicated cases have 30-50% mortality.",
      "formal": "Type B Management: Uncomplicated → Medical (anti-impulse: HR <60, SBP <120) | Complicated (malperfusion, rupture, refractory, expansion) → Urgent TEVAR | Mortality: Uncomplicated 10%, Complicated 30-50%"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Type B dissection doesn't involve the ascending aorta, so the immediate threats (tamponade, coronary obstruction) aren't present. The treatment is to reduce the force of blood hitting the dissected wall - slow the heart rate and lower the blood pressure so the false lumen doesn't expand or rupture. If complications develop (organs losing blood supply, impending rupture), then intervention becomes necessary.",
      "key_insight": "The key decision in Type B dissection is recognizing complications. Uncomplicated Type B does well with medical therapy alone - rushing to intervention may cause harm. But complicated Type B needs urgent action. The 'complicated' criteria are: malperfusion syndrome (organ ischemia), rupture/impending rupture, refractory pain despite analgesia, refractory hypertension despite multiple agents, and rapid expansion.",
      "technical_details": "Medical therapy: IV esmolol or labetalol to target HR <60 bpm and SBP 100-120 mmHg. Add vasodilators (nitroprusside) only after beta-blockade to avoid reflex tachycardia. ICU monitoring. Pain control with opioids. Transition to oral beta-blockers for long-term management. TEVAR indications: Covers entry tear with endograft, promotes false lumen thrombosis and aortic remodeling. INSTEAD/IRAD trials show TEVAR improves outcomes in complicated cases. ADSORB trial showed improved remodeling with TEVAR even in uncomplicated cases, but survival benefit unclear - current practice reserves TEVAR for complications.",
      "common_misconceptions": [
        "All Type B dissections need surgery - uncomplicated cases do better with medical therapy",
        "Medical therapy just means pain control - aggressive HR/BP control is essential",
        "Malperfusion always means intervention - some cases resolve with blood pressure control",
        "TEVAR treats the whole dissected aorta - it covers the entry tear, not the entire dissection"
