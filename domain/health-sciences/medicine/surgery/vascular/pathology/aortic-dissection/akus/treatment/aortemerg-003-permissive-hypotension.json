    "statement": {
      "text": "Permissive hypotension is a deliberate resuscitation strategy in ruptured aortic aneurysm and other hemorrhagic emergencies that accepts lower-than-normal blood pressure targets to minimize ongoing hemorrhage while maintaining critical end-organ perfusion. By targeting systolic blood pressure of 70-90 mmHg in an awake, responsive patient, this approach preserves the hemostatic clot, avoids dilutional coagulopathy from crystalloid overload, and prevents 'popping the clot' that has tamponaded the rupture site. The strategy is maintained only until aortic control is achieved, after which normal resuscitation targets apply.",
      "formal": "Permissive Hypotension: Target SBP 70-90 mmHg in awake patient, minimize crystalloid, use blood products (1:1:1 ratio), avoid vasopressors. Continue until aortic clamp applied, then resuscitate to normal goals."
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Think of a dam with a crack that's been temporarily plugged by debris. If you increase the water pressure behind the dam, you'll blow out the plug and cause catastrophic flooding. Similarly, in a ruptured aorta, the body has formed a clot that's temporarily stopping the bleeding. Raising blood pressure with aggressive fluid resuscitation is like raising the water level behind the dam - it can blow out the clot and cause uncontrollable hemorrhage.",
      "key_insight": "The paradigm shift is recognizing that 'normal' blood pressure is harmful in the pre-operative phase of ruptured AAA. Aggressive resuscitation to normalize blood pressure is counterproductive because: (1) higher pressure increases transmural stress across the rupture site, (2) crystalloid dilutes clotting factors and causes coagulopathy, and (3) disrupting the retroperitoneal tamponade converts contained to free rupture.",
      "technical_details": "Permissive hypotension is a component of damage control resuscitation (DCR), which also includes minimizing crystalloid, early blood product administration (1:1:1 ratio of PRBCs:FFP:platelets), preventing hypothermia, and correcting acidosis. The target SBP of 70-90 mmHg maintains adequate coronary and cerebral perfusion in most patients while minimizing hydrostatic pressure on the rupture site. Clinical endpoints include mental status (must remain awake and responsive), urine output (some is acceptable, not targeting normal), and lactate (trending, not targeting normal). Vasopressors are generally avoided pre-operatively because they increase afterload and transmural pressure on the rupture."
