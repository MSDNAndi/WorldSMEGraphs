    "statement": {
      "text": "The Stanford Classification divides aortic dissection into two types based on involvement of the ascending aorta: Type A involves the ascending aorta (regardless of origin) and requires emergency surgery; Type B involves only the descending aorta and is initially managed with medical therapy. This simple binary classification directly guides treatment decisions.",
      "formal": "Stanford Type A: Ascending aorta involved → Emergency surgical repair | Stanford Type B: Ascending aorta NOT involved (descending only) → Medical management ± TEVAR for complications"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "The Stanford Classification asks one simple question: Is the ascending aorta involved? If yes = Type A = surgery. If no = Type B = medicine. This simplicity is intentional because the ascending aorta is the 'danger zone' - dissection here can tear into the coronary arteries (causing heart attack), the pericardium (causing tamponade), or the aortic valve (causing heart failure). Time is everything in Type A, so a binary classification that immediately dictates treatment is more useful than a detailed anatomic description.",
      "key_insight": "Stanford Type A requires surgery not because surgery is easy, but because NOT operating is uniformly fatal. With medical management alone, Type A mortality is 1-2% per hour in the first 48 hours. Even with emergency surgery carrying 15-25% mortality, it's still far better than the alternative.",
      "technical_details": "The classification was proposed by Daily and colleagues at Stanford in 1970 to simplify the DeBakey system for treatment planning. Type A includes DeBakey Types I and II; Type B corresponds to DeBakey Type III. Important nuances: (1) Retrograde dissection - an entry tear in descending aorta that propagates retrograde into ascending = Type A; (2) Arch involvement - isolated arch without ascending = controversial, some treat as Type A; (3) Post-surgical - dissection after prior ascending aortic surgery depends on new dissection location.",
      "common_misconceptions": [
        "Type A means the tear is in the ascending aorta - the tear location doesn't matter, only whether ascending is involved",
        "Type B is benign - mortality is still 10-15% and complications can be lethal",
        "Arch involvement = Type A - isolated arch is debated; usually treated as Type A",
        "Stanford has replaced DeBakey - both are still used; Stanford for treatment, DeBakey for anatomic detail"
