    "statement": {
      "text": "Contained aortic rupture is a form of aortic wall disruption in which hemorrhage is tamponaded by surrounding retroperitoneal tissues, posterior pararenal fascia, or periaortic structures, providing temporary hemodynamic stability. This condition represents a tenuous equilibrium that can transition to free rupture (exsanguination) at any moment. The contained rupture allows a diagnostic and therapeutic window, but demands urgent intervention with strict hemodynamic control to prevent clot disruption and conversion to free hemorrhage.",
      "formal": "Contained Rupture: Aortic wall breach with extravasation tamponaded by retroperitoneum/periaortic tissues, creating transient stability. Hemodynamic state is precarious - clot disruption leads to free rupture and exsanguination."
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Imagine a water balloon with a small hole that's been plugged by pressing it against a wall. As long as the balloon stays pressed against the wall and the pressure doesn't increase, the leak is contained. But any movement, increase in pressure, or loss of the wall support causes the plug to dislodge and water pours out. A contained aortic rupture works the same way - the surrounding tissues act as the 'wall' holding back hemorrhage, but this is inherently unstable.",
      "key_insight": "The critical clinical implication is that a patient with contained rupture may appear deceptively stable. This stability is false security - they are 'one cough away' from free rupture. The management priority is maintaining this precarious tamponade (permissive hypotension, avoiding straining) while rapidly proceeding to definitive repair.",
      "technical_details": "Contained rupture typically occurs on the posterolateral aspect of the aorta, where the retroperitoneum provides tissue resistance. CT findings include periaortic hematoma, irregular aneurysm contour, the 'draped aorta sign' (posterior aortic wall conforming to the vertebral body without intervening retroperitoneal fat), and the 'crescent sign' (crescentic high-attenuation within the thrombus indicating acute intramural blood). Contrast extravasation indicates active bleeding within the contained space."
