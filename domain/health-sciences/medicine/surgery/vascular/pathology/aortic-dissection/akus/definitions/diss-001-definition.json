    "statement": {
      "text": "Aortic dissection is a life-threatening condition where a tear in the aortic intima allows blood to enter and separate the layers of the aortic wall, creating a 'false lumen' parallel to the native 'true lumen'. It is classified by the Stanford system: Type A involves the ascending aorta (requires emergency surgery) and Type B involves only the descending aorta (initially managed medically).",
      "formal": "Aortic Dissection: Intimal tear → Blood enters media → Separation of wall layers → True lumen + False lumen | Stanford A: Ascending aorta involved (60-70%) → Surgical emergency | Stanford B: Ascending aorta NOT involved (30-40%) → Medical management ± intervention"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Imagine the aortic wall as a multi-layered tube, like the skin of an onion. In dissection, blood tears through the inner layer and forces its way between the layers, creating a new channel (false lumen) alongside the original channel (true lumen). The blood rushing through this false lumen can extend the tear in either direction, potentially blocking branch arteries or rupturing through the outer wall.",
      "key_insight": "The critical distinction in aortic dissection is whether the ascending aorta is involved (Type A) or not (Type B). Type A is a surgical emergency because it can cause: (1) acute aortic regurgitation, (2) coronary malperfusion causing MI, (3) tamponade from rupture into pericardium, (4) stroke from arch vessel involvement. Without surgery, Type A mortality increases 1-2% per hour in the first 48 hours.",
      "technical_details": "The intimal tear typically occurs at points of maximum wall stress: the ascending aorta 2-3 cm above the aortic valve (65%) or just distal to the left subclavian artery (20-30%). The dissection propagates in an antegrade direction (following blood flow) in 70% of cases. The false lumen can: (1) remain patent with active blood flow, (2) thrombose partially or completely, (3) compress the true lumen causing malperfusion, or (4) rupture. Re-entry tears allow blood to flow back from false to true lumen.",
      "common_misconceptions": [
        "Dissection is the same as aneurysm - they're distinct pathologies (though dissected aortas can become aneurysmal)",
        "All dissections need emergency surgery - only Type A; uncomplicated Type B is managed medically",
        "Dissection always causes chest pain - some present with syncope, stroke, or ischemic leg",
        "CT shows everything - TEE is better for aortic regurgitation and coronary involvement"
