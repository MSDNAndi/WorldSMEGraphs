    "statement": {
      "text": "Aortic dissection classically presents with sudden, severe, 'tearing' or 'ripping' chest or back pain that may migrate as the dissection propagates. Additional findings may include pulse deficits, blood pressure differentials between arms, new aortic regurgitation murmur, or malperfusion syndromes affecting end organs. However, presentation varies widely and dissection should be considered in any high-risk patient with sudden severe chest/back pain.",
      "formal": "Classic Presentation: Sudden onset severe tearing/ripping pain (chest, back, or interscapular) + One or more of: Pulse deficit | BP differential >20 mmHg | Aortic regurgitation | Malperfusion (stroke, limb ischemia, abdominal) | Hypotension/shock"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "When the aorta tears, patients often describe it as the worst pain of their life, sudden and tearing. The pain location tracks the dissection: ascending involvement causes anterior chest pain, descending causes back pain. As the false lumen expands, it can compress or obstruct branch arteries, explaining why some patients present with stroke, cold leg, or abdominal symptoms rather than just pain.",
      "key_insight": "Aortic dissection is a great imitator - it can present as MI, stroke, acute abdomen, or limb ischemia. The key is to think of dissection in any high-risk patient (hypertensive, connective tissue disease, cocaine use) with sudden severe pain, especially if they have 'something else' (abnormal pulse, new murmur, or focal neuro deficit). Missing the diagnosis is often fatal.",
      "technical_details": "Pain characteristics: Described as 'tearing' or 'ripping' in ~50%, abrupt maximal onset in ~85%. Location reflects anatomy: Type A = anterior chest, Type B = interscapular/back. Migration of pain suggests propagating dissection. Malperfusion syndromes by vessel: (1) Arch branches → stroke, syncope; (2) Coronary → MI (usually RCA/right coronary); (3) Intercostal/spinal → paraplegia; (4) Mesenteric → bowel ischemia; (5) Renal → oliguria, hypertension; (6) Iliac → limb ischemia. Physical findings: BP differential >20 mmHg (30%), pulse deficit (30%), aortic regurgitation murmur (32% of Type A).",

        "Dissection always causes tearing chest pain - presentation varies widely",

        "All dissection patients are hypertensive - some present with hypotension",
