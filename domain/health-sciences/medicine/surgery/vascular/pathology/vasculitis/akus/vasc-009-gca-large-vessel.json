      "text": "Large vessel giant cell arteritis (LV-GCA) involves the aorta and its primary branches in addition to cranial arteries, causing stenoses, aneurysms, and dissections that may require surgical or endovascular intervention in 15-20% of GCA patients.",

    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Most people think of giant cell arteritis as a headache disease affecting head arteries, but it can also attack the aorta and its major branches. This can weaken or block these large vessels, sometimes requiring surgery years later.",
      "key_insight": "Aortic involvement in GCA is underrecognized. Thoracic aortic aneurysm risk is 17x higher in GCA patients. All patients with confirmed GCA should have baseline imaging of the aorta and ongoing surveillance.",
      "technical_details": "Distribution: thoracic aorta > subclavian > axillary > carotid. Manifestations: stenosis (upper extremity claudication), aneurysm (17x increased risk thoracic, 2x abdominal), dissection. Diagnosis: CTA/MRA showing wall thickening, PET showing FDG uptake. Timing: vascular complications may develop years after initial diagnosis. Management: steroids (reduce inflammation), surveillance imaging, surgical repair for aneurysms (standard thresholds apply)."
