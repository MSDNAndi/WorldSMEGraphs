      "text": "Surgical intervention in Takayasu arteritis should be performed during disease quiescence whenever possible, as active inflammation at the time of surgery increases complication rates including anastomotic failure and restenosis.",

    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Operating on inflamed, swollen arteries is like sewing into wet tissue paper - sutures tear through and repairs fail. When the inflammation is controlled (quiescent phase), the arteries are stronger and heal better.",
      "key_insight": "Disease activity assessment before surgery is critical. Markers include ESR, CRP, and imaging (PET-CT). Elective procedures should wait for quiescence. Emergency intervention may be necessary despite active disease.",
      "technical_details": "Quiescence criteria: normal ESR/CRP, no systemic symptoms, stable imaging. Imaging: PET-CT can assess metabolic activity. Active disease risks: anastomotic aneurysm (15% vs 5%), restenosis (30% vs 10%), suture line dehiscence. Surgical considerations: bypass preferred over endarterectomy (avoid inflamed vessels), extra-anatomic routes may be needed, autologous conduit preferred. Exception: critical limb-threatening or organ-threatening ischemia may require urgent intervention despite active disease."
