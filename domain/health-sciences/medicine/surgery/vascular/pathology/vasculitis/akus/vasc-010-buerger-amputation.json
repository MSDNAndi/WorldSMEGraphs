      "text": "Amputation in Buerger disease (thromboangiitis obliterans) is primarily determined by continued tobacco use, with major amputation rates of 10-25% at 5 years in active smokers reduced to near zero with complete smoking cessation.",
      "formal": "Amputation_Risk = f(Smoking_Status) | Active_Smoker → 10-25%_at_5y | Complete_Cessation → ~0%"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Buerger disease is unique among vascular diseases because the pathology is directly caused by tobacco exposure. Unlike atherosclerosis where risk factors accelerate disease, in Buerger disease tobacco IS the disease. Remove the tobacco, and the disease stops progressing.",
      "key_insight": "Complete abstinence from ALL tobacco products (including smokeless tobacco, marijuana, and nicotine replacement) is essential. Even a single cigarette can reactivate disease and precipitate amputation. The vascular surgeon's most important intervention is smoking cessation counseling.",
      "technical_details": "Buerger disease affects small and medium vessels of extremities. Revascularization options are severely limited due to distal vessel involvement - no suitable target for bypass in most cases. When amputation is required: (1) Delay amputation as long as possible to allow collateral development; (2) Attempt tissue-sparing levels; (3) Multiple minor amputations (toe, ray) common before major amputation; (4) Healing may be delayed due to poor distal perfusion; (5) Sympathectomy may improve healing and pain. Adjunctive therapies: Iloprost (prostacyclin analog), spinal cord stimulation, hyperbaric oxygen - limited evidence."
