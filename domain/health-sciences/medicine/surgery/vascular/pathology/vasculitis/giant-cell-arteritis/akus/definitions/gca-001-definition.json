    "statement": {
      "text": "Giant cell arteritis (GCA) is a systemic granulomatous vasculitis affecting medium and large arteries, predominantly in patients over 50 years (peak 70-80). It affects cranial branches (temporal arteritis) and large vessels (aortitis). Vision loss from ophthalmic artery involvement is the most feared complication, requiring emergency high-dose steroids.",
      "formal": "GCA: Large/medium vessel granulomatous vasculitis; Age >50 (peak 70-80); Manifestations: cranial (headache, jaw claudication, vision loss) + large vessel (aortitis, aneurysm)"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "GCA is inflammation attacking the lining of arteries, with a predilection for arteries near the temples and eyes in its cranial form. Think of it as the body mistakenly attacking its own blood vessel walls. When this hits the artery supplying the eye (ophthalmic artery), vision can be lost within hours - making this a true emergency.",
      "key_insight": "GCA has two overlapping phenotypes: cranial GCA (headache, jaw claudication, visual symptoms) and large-vessel GCA (aortitis, limb claudication). Large-vessel GCA can occur without cranial symptoms and leads to thoracic aortic aneurysm in 10-20% of patients, requiring lifelong aortic surveillance.",
      "technical_details": "Histology shows granulomatous inflammation with multinucleated giant cells at the internal elastic lamina. The inflammatory infiltrate causes intimal hyperplasia (stenosis/occlusion) and medial destruction (aneurysm). Affects external carotid branches (temporal, occipital) and vertebral, ophthalmic, and posterior ciliary arteries. Large vessel involvement includes thoracic aorta, subclavian, and axillary arteries."
