      "text": "Takayasu arteritis (TA) is a chronic granulomatous large-vessel vasculitis primarily affecting the aorta and its major branches. It predominantly affects young women (F:M 9:1), with onset typically before age 40. The disease progresses from an active inflammatory phase to a chronic fibrotic phase with arterial stenosis, occlusion, and aneurysm formation.",
      "formal": "Takayasu: Large vessel granulomatous vasculitis; Aorta + branches; F:M 9:1, age <40; Phases: inflammatory → fibrotic/occlusive"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Takayasu arteritis is like having chronic inflammation attack the walls of your major highways (large arteries). Over time, this inflammation scars the walls, causing them to thicken and narrow - like a highway slowly being closed down. Some sections may weaken and balloon (aneurysms), while others become completely blocked, rerouting traffic through smaller roads (collaterals).",
      "key_insight": "TA has two phases requiring different management strategies. In the active inflammatory phase, medical therapy (steroids, immunosuppression) is primary. In the quiescent fibrotic phase, revascularization may be needed for hemodynamically significant stenoses. Surgery during active inflammation has high failure rates due to anastomotic complications.",
      "technical_details": "Histology shows granulomatous inflammation with giant cells affecting the media and adventitia. The inflammatory process leads to intimal proliferation (stenosis) and medial destruction (aneurysm). Most commonly affects aortic arch and its branches (brachiocephalic, subclavian, carotid), but can involve any segment including abdominal aorta, renal, and pulmonary arteries."
