    "statement": {
      "text": "Buerger disease (thromboangiitis obliterans, TAO) is a non-atherosclerotic, segmental inflammatory vasculopathy affecting small and medium arteries and veins of the upper and lower extremities. It occurs almost exclusively in young smokers (typically male, age <45) and is absolutely dependent on tobacco use - the disease arrests with smoking cessation and progresses with continued use.",
      "formal": "Buerger/TAO: Segmental inflammatory vasculopathy; Small/medium arteries + veins; Demographics: young male smokers <45yo; Pathognomonic: tobacco dependence - cessation → remission"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Buerger disease is like an allergic reaction to tobacco occurring inside your blood vessels. The inflammatory response causes clots to form inside the small arteries of the hands and feet, cutting off blood supply to the fingers and toes. Unlike atherosclerosis which builds up slowly over decades, Buerger's can rapidly progress to gangrene in young patients. The only effective treatment is absolute tobacco cessation.",
      "key_insight": "Tobacco cessation is the ONLY proven treatment to halt disease progression. Even one cigarette can trigger disease exacerbation. Patients who quit smoking rarely require amputation; those who continue have amputation rates of 40-50%. Nicotine replacement is controversial as it may perpetuate disease.",
      "technical_details": "Histologically distinct from other vasculitides: highly cellular, inflammatory thrombus with preserved internal elastic lamina (vessel wall architecture maintained). Affects tibial, radial, ulnar, digital arteries and corresponding veins. Angiography shows segmental occlusions with 'corkscrew' collaterals (pathognomonic), no atherosclerosis in larger vessels."
