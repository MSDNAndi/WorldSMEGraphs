    "statement": {
      "text": "Steal syndrome (Hemodialysis Access-Induced Distal Ischemia - HAIDI) occurs when arteriovenous access diverts blood flow away from the hand, causing symptoms ranging from coolness to severe ischemic tissue loss.",
      "formal": "Incidence: 1-5% of AVF, 5-10% of AVG; Risk factors: Diabetes, PAD, female, elderly, proximal access; Staging: HAIDI 1-4; Treatment: Banding, DRIL, RUDI, or ligation"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "The dialysis access creates a low-resistance pathway that 'steals' blood that would normally go to the hand. The more proximal the access, the greater the risk of starving the hand of blood.",
      "key_insight": "Steal syndrome is about both access flow and hand perfusion - some patients steal because the access flows too much, others because their hand has poor baseline perfusion.",
      "technical_details": "Dialysis access-induced hand ischemia results from arterial inflow being preferentially diverted into the low-resistance venous outflow of the access. Physiologic steal occurs in all functional accesses but becomes symptomatic when hand perfusion is inadequate. Risk factors include diabetes, peripheral arterial disease, female sex, elderly, and proximal access (brachial > radial). The HAIDI classification stages symptoms from mild pain (grade 1) to tissue loss (grade 4). Treatment options include access banding, DRIL procedure, RUDI, PAI, or access ligation.",
      "common_misconceptions": [
        "All steal requires access ligation - FALSE, many can be managed with flow reduction",
