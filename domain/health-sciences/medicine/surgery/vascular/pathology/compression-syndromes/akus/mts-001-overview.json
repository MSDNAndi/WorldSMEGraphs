      {

        "term": "Venous Spur",

        "concept": "Anatomical Variants",
        "explanation": "Classic MTS: left CIV compressed by right CIA. Variants include: right-sided MTS (right CIV compression), bilateral compression, and external iliac compression. Anatomic compression is present in 20-30% of the population but only a minority become symptomatic."

      {
        "concept": "Clinical Presentations",
        "explanation": "Acute: iliofemoral DVT, often in young otherwise healthy patients (especially women). Chronic: leg swelling, venous claudication, varicosities, skin changes (CVI). Some present with both acute thrombus and underlying chronic stenosis."
      },
      {
        "concept": "Diagnostic Imaging",
        "explanation": "IVUS is the gold standard for diagnosis and shows >50% stenosis and/or venous spur. CT venography and MR venography show compression but may underestimate severity. Conventional venography with pressure measurements can demonstrate obstruction."

      {
        "concept": "Venous Stenting",
        "explanation": "Iliac vein stenting is the primary treatment for symptomatic MTS. Use dedicated venous stents (larger diameter, crush-resistant). Stenting for acute DVT is combined with catheter-directed thrombolysis. Primary patency rates exceed 90% at 1-2 years."
