        "concept": "Aortomesenteric Angle",
        "explanation": "Normal angle between aorta and SMA is 38-56 degrees. Reduced angle (<25-30 degrees) predisposes to LRV compression. Thin patients, rapid weight loss, and lordosis can reduce this angle."

        "concept": "Treatment Options",
        "explanation": "Conservative: observation in children/adolescents as angle may increase with growth. Interventional: LRV stenting (gaining favor). Surgical: LRV transposition, renal autotransplantation, gonadal vein transposition. Choice depends on patient age and symptom severity."
