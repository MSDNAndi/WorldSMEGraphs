  "description": "Loeys-Dietz syndrome is classified into five subtypes (LDS1-5) based on the causative gene mutation, all affecting the TGF-beta signaling pathway. Each subtype exhibits overlapping clinical features with some genotype-phenotype correlations. LDS1 (TGFBR1) and LDS2 (TGFBR2) are the most common and often most severe. LDS3 (SMAD3) is associated with early-onset osteoarthritis. LDS4 (TGFB2) and LDS5 (TGFB3) may present with milder vascular phenotypes.",
