  "description": "Surgical intervention thresholds in Loeys-Dietz syndrome are significantly lower than in Marfan syndrome due to the aggressive vascular phenotype. The recommended aortic root intervention threshold is 4.0-4.2 cm (compared to 5.0 cm for Marfan). Decision-making incorporates growth rate, family history, genetic subtype, and anatomic features. Valve-sparing techniques are preferred when feasible, and the entire arterial tree requires assessment for potential intervention.",
