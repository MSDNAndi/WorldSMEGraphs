  "description": "Pregnancy in Marfan syndrome carries significant cardiovascular risks, primarily aortic dissection. Risk stratification is based on pre-pregnancy aortic root diameter, with the threshold generally set at 4.0-4.5 cm. Multidisciplinary management involving cardiology, maternal-fetal medicine, anesthesiology, and cardiovascular surgery is essential. Careful pre-pregnancy counseling, aggressive medical management, and planned delivery are critical components of care.",
