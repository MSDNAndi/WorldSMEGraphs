  "description": "Valve-sparing root replacement (VSRR) preserves the native aortic valve while replacing the aortic root, eliminating the need for lifelong anticoagulation. The David procedure (reimplantation) and Yacoub procedure (remodeling) are the two main techniques. The David procedure is preferred in Marfan syndrome due to annular stabilization. Excellent long-term outcomes in experienced centers make this the preferred approach for suitable young Marfan patients.",
