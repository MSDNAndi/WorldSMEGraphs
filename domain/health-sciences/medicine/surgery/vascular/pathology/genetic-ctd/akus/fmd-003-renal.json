  "description": "Renal fibromuscular dysplasia is the most common manifestation of FMD, affecting 60-75% of patients. It predominantly affects young to middle-aged women and is a significant cause of secondary hypertension. The characteristic 'string of beads' appearance on angiography distinguishes medial fibroplasia from other types. Treatment with percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (WITHOUT stent) is highly effective for renovascular hypertension, with cure or improvement in the majority of patients.",

    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "When a young woman has difficult-to-control high blood pressure, suspect that narrowing in the kidney arteries (from FMD, not cholesterol) is the culprit. A simple balloon angioplasty can cure her hypertension.",
      "key_insight": "Unlike atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis (which is ostial and requires stenting with poor results), FMD is mid-to-distal and treated with angioplasty alone. Stenting is avoided because FMD lesions don't recoil like atherosclerotic ones and stent complications outweigh benefits.",
      "technical_details": "Medial fibroplasia (most common type) shows string of beads with beads LARGER than normal lumen on angiography. Treatment is PTA without stent. Success rates for hypertension cure (35-50%) or improvement (40-50%) are excellent, far better than atherosclerotic disease."
