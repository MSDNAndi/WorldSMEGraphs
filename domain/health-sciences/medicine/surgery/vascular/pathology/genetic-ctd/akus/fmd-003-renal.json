  "description": "Renal fibromuscular dysplasia is the most common manifestation of FMD, affecting 60-75% of patients. It predominantly affects young to middle-aged women and is a significant cause of secondary hypertension. The characteristic 'string of beads' appearance on angiography distinguishes medial fibroplasia from other types. Treatment with percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (WITHOUT stent) is highly effective for renovascular hypertension, with cure or improvement in the majority of patients.",
