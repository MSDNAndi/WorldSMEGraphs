      "text": "Takayasu arteritis is a chronic, granulomatous large-vessel vasculitis primarily affecting the aorta and its major branches in young women, characterized by a systemic inflammatory phase followed by an occlusive/stenotic phase causing upper extremity claudication, absent pulses, and end-organ ischemia.",
      "formal": "Takayasu Arteritis: Large Vessel Vasculitis → Aorta/Branches → Young Asian Female → Systemic Phase (ESR↑, Fever) → Occlusive Phase (Pulseless, Stenosis, Claudication) → Immunosuppression + Bypass"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Takayasu's is an autoimmune attack on the body's largest blood vessels. The inflammation causes the aortic wall to thicken and scar, eventually blocking blood flow. It's called 'pulseless disease' because the arm pulses disappear as the arteries narrow.",
      "key_insight": "The disease has two phases: an early systemic phase with fever, fatigue, and high inflammatory markers, followed by an occlusive phase with vascular stenosis. Treatment differs by phase - immunosuppression during inflammation, revascularization during quiescent disease.",
      "technical_details": "Angiographic classification: Type I (branches from arch), Type IIa (ascending, arch, branches), Type IIb (adds descending), Type III (descending/abdominal/renal), Type IV (abdominal only), Type V (combined). Surgery/endovascular best performed during disease quiescence."
