    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Think of fibrillin as the 'rebar' of connective tissue. When it's defective, the aortic wall becomes weak and stretches progressively, like an old rubber band that loses its elasticity. Eventually, it can tear (dissect) or burst.",
      "key_insight": "Marfan syndrome is not just an aortic root problem - it affects the entire body including the eyes (lens dislocation), skeleton (tall stature, long limbs), and lungs (pneumothorax). The cardiovascular manifestations are the primary cause of mortality.",
      "technical_details": "The Ghent criteria (2010) use a combination of aortic root Z-score, ectopia lentis, FBN1 mutation status, and systemic features score to make the diagnosis. Aortic root Z-score ≥2 plus a known FBN1 mutation is sufficient for diagnosis."
