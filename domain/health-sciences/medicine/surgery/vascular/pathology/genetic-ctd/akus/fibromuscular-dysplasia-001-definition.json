    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "FMD is NOT cholesterol buildup. It's an abnormality in how the arterial wall forms - creating alternating thick and thin segments that look like a string of beads. Young women get it, and it often causes high blood pressure from kidney artery involvement.",
      "key_insight": "The classic 'string of beads' appearance with beads LARGER than the normal lumen indicates medial fibroplasia (most common type). Unlike atherosclerotic disease, FMD responds excellently to balloon angioplasty WITHOUT stent.",
      "technical_details": "Medial fibroplasia (80-90% of FMD) affects mid-to-distal arteries and is treated with PTA without stent (85-95% cure/improvement for renal hypertension). Intimal fibroplasia causes focal concentric stenosis and may require stent."
