  "description": "Surveillance in Loeys-Dietz syndrome requires comprehensive imaging of the entire arterial tree from head to pelvis, more frequently than in Marfan syndrome. The aggressive vascular phenotype necessitates baseline complete imaging, regular echocardiography, and periodic CT or MRI angiography. Intracranial aneurysm screening is essential. Post-surgical surveillance is lifelong, as multiple arterial territories remain at risk.",

Coverage should include brain MRA (intracranial aneurysms), neck (carotid/vertebral), and complete aorta with branch vessels from root to iliacs."
