  "description": "Loeys-Dietz syndrome exhibits a uniquely aggressive vascular phenotype characterized by earlier and more widespread arterial disease than Marfan syndrome. Key features include arterial tortuosity throughout the arterial tree, aneurysms beyond the aortic root, aortic dissection at significantly smaller diameters, and branch vessel involvement. Understanding this aggressive phenotype is critical for appropriate surveillance and timely intervention.",
