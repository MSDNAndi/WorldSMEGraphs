  "description": "Vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome presents unique surgical challenges due to extreme tissue fragility. Tissues do not hold sutures well, bleed excessively, and heal poorly. The fundamental principle is to avoid surgery whenever possible. When intervention is unavoidable, meticulous technique, experienced surgical teams, and modified approaches are essential. Endovascular options may be preferred in some scenarios, though they carry their own risks.",

    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Imagine trying to sew wet tissue paper - that's what operating on vEDS tissue is like. Sutures pull through, vessels tear when touched, and nothing heals properly. The best surgery is no surgery.",
      "key_insight": "Unlike other connective tissue disorders where prophylactic surgery is lifesaving, in vEDS the surgical risk is so high that conservative management is usually preferred. When surgery is unavoidable, every technique must be modified to account for tissue fragility.",
      "technical_details": "Never clamp vessels (use balloon occlusion), never retract aggressively, use pledgeted horizontal mattress sutures, avoid any tension, consider prosthetic conduit over vein harvest. Endovascular approaches may be preferred for hemorrhage control (embolization) but carry their own risks of vessel injury."
