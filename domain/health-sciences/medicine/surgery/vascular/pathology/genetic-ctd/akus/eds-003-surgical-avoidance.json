  "description": "Vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome presents unique surgical challenges due to extreme tissue fragility. Tissues do not hold sutures well, bleed excessively, and heal poorly. The fundamental principle is to avoid surgery whenever possible. When intervention is unavoidable, meticulous technique, experienced surgical teams, and modified approaches are essential. Endovascular options may be preferred in some scenarios, though they carry their own risks.",
