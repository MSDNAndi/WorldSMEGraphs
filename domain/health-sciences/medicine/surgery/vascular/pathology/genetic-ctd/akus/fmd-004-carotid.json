  "description": "Carotid and vertebral artery fibromuscular dysplasia is the second most common manifestation of FMD, affecting 25-30% of patients. It can present with stroke, transient ischemic attack, dissection, or be discovered incidentally. The internal carotid artery is typically affected in its mid to distal cervical segment. Unlike renal FMD, intervention is less straightforward, and management is often medical with antiplatelet therapy. Screening for intracranial aneurysms is essential due to the 12-14% association.",
