  "description": "Lifelong aortic surveillance is mandatory in Marfan syndrome to detect progressive dilation, enable timely prophylactic surgery, and identify new aortic pathology. Surveillance includes regular imaging of the entire aorta with echocardiography, CT, or MRI. Frequency is determined by aortic size, rate of growth, and surgical history. Standardized measurement techniques are essential for accurate comparison over time.",

    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Marfan syndrome is a progressive disease - the aorta doesn't stop growing. Regular imaging catches dangerous dilation before it becomes catastrophic, allowing planned surgery rather than emergency operation with much higher mortality.",

      "technical_details": "Echocardiography is first-line for root surveillance. Complete aortic imaging (CT or MRI, head to pelvis) should be done periodically. MRI is preferred for long-term surveillance to avoid cumulative radiation. Use consistent measurement techniques for valid serial comparisons."
