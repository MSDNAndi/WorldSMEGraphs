  "description": "Lifelong aortic surveillance is mandatory in Marfan syndrome to detect progressive dilation, enable timely prophylactic surgery, and identify new aortic pathology. Surveillance includes regular imaging of the entire aorta with echocardiography, CT, or MRI. Frequency is determined by aortic size, rate of growth, and surgical history. Standardized measurement techniques are essential for accurate comparison over time.",
