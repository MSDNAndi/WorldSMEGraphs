  "description": "Vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (vEDS) results from heterozygous mutations in the COL3A1 gene encoding type III procollagen. Over 600 different mutations have been identified, with the majority being missense mutations affecting glycine residues in the Gly-X-Y triplet repeat. Genotype-phenotype correlations exist, with certain mutation types conferring higher vascular risk. Understanding the genetics is essential for diagnosis, prognosis, and family counseling.",
