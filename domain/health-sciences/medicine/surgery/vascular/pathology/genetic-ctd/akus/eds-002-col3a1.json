  "description": "Vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (vEDS) results from heterozygous mutations in the COL3A1 gene encoding type III procollagen. Over 600 different mutations have been identified, with the majority being missense mutations affecting glycine residues in the Gly-X-Y triplet repeat. Genotype-phenotype correlations exist, with certain mutation types conferring higher vascular risk. Understanding the genetics is essential for diagnosis, prognosis, and family counseling.",

      "intuition": "Type III collagen is the 'rebar' of blood vessel walls. When the COL3A1 gene is mutated, this structural protein is either defective or deficient, leaving vessels, intestines, and uterus dangerously fragile.",
      "key_insight": "Dominant-negative mutations (especially glycine substitutions) are generally more severe because the abnormal collagen chains incorporate into the triple helix, disrupting the entire structure. Null mutations producing no protein may be milder because remaining collagen is normal, just reduced.",
      "technical_details": "Type III collagen requires glycine at every third position (Gly-X-Y repeat) for proper triple helix formation. Glycine substitutions disrupt helix assembly, leading to abnormal or reduced collagen secretion. ~50% of vEDS cases are de novo mutations."
