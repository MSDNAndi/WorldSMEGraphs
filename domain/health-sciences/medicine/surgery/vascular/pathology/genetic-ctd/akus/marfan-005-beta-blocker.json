  "description": "Beta-adrenergic blockade is the cornerstone of medical therapy in Marfan syndrome, reducing the rate of aortic root dilation and decreasing the risk of aortic dissection. Beta-blockers reduce heart rate, blood pressure, and aortic wall stress (dP/dt). Losartan and other ARBs have emerged as adjunctive therapy targeting TGF-beta signaling. Current guidelines recommend combination therapy in most Marfan patients.",
