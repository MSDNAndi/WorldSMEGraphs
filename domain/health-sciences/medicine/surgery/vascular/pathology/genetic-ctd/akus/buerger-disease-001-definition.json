      "intuition": "Buerger disease is essentially a tobacco-induced attack on the small blood vessels of the hands and feet. The arteries become inflamed and clot off segment by segment. The only cure is complete tobacco cessation.",

      "technical_details": "Angiography shows 'corkscrew collaterals' and segmental occlusions. The inflammatory infiltrate is polymorphonuclear with giant cells. All forms of tobacco must be stopped - even one cigarette can precipitate an exacerbation."
