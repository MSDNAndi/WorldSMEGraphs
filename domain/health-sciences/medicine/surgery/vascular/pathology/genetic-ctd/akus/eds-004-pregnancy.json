  "description": "Pregnancy in vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome carries extremely high maternal mortality risk, estimated at 5-12% per pregnancy. The major risks are uterine rupture, arterial rupture/dissection, and bowel perforation. Unlike Marfan syndrome, there is no aortic diameter threshold that can stratify risk - rupture occurs unpredictably. Extensive preconception counseling is essential, and some experts consider pregnancy relatively contraindicated. If pregnancy occurs, multidisciplinary management at a specialized center is mandatory.",
