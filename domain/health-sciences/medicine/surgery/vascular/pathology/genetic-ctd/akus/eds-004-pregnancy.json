  "description": "Pregnancy in vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome carries extremely high maternal mortality risk, estimated at 5-12% per pregnancy. The major risks are uterine rupture, arterial rupture/dissection, and bowel perforation. Unlike Marfan syndrome, there is no aortic diameter threshold that can stratify risk - rupture occurs unpredictably. Extensive preconception counseling is essential, and some experts consider pregnancy relatively contraindicated. If pregnancy occurs, multidisciplinary management at a specialized center is mandatory.",

      "intuition": "Pregnancy in vEDS is a gamble with a 1-in-10 to 1-in-20 chance of maternal death. Unlike Marfan, there's no measurement that tells you who is 'safe' - vessels and uterus can rupture unpredictably at any size.",
      "key_insight": "The 5-12% mortality rate is PER PREGNANCY, not lifetime. There is no aortic diameter threshold for risk stratification because in vEDS, rupture occurs without preceding dilation. Some experts consider pregnancy relatively contraindicated given this risk.",
      "technical_details": "Major causes of death are arterial rupture, uterine rupture, and bowel perforation. Third trimester and early postpartum are highest risk periods. If pregnancy proceeds, planned cesarean delivery at 34-37 weeks in a tertiary center with multidisciplinary team and surgical backup is recommended."
