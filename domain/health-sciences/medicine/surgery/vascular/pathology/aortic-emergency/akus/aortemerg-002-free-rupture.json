  "content": {
    "definition": {
      "formal": "Free aortic rupture refers to the complete disruption of the aortic wall with hemorrhage into the peritoneal cavity or unrestricted mediastinal/pleural space, resulting in rapid exsanguination and cardiovascular collapse.",
      "clinical": "Catastrophic uncontained aortic bleeding causing immediate hemodynamic instability with mortality approaching 90% without immediate intervention."
    },
    "core_concepts": [
      {
        "concept": "Pathophysiology",
        "explanation": "Complete transmural aortic wall disruption allows unrestricted hemorrhage. The peritoneal cavity offers no tamponade, unlike retroperitoneal rupture. Rapid blood loss causes immediate shock. Mortality is directly proportional to time from rupture to aortic control.",
        "clinical_significance": "Unlike contained rupture, there is no time for stabilization - immediate OR transport is the only chance for survival."
      },
      {
        "concept": "Clinical Presentation",
        "explanation": "Classic triad of abdominal pain, pulsatile mass, and hypotension is rarely complete because patients lose consciousness rapidly. More commonly presents as sudden cardiovascular collapse. Abdominal distension develops quickly from hemoperitoneum.",
        "clinical_significance": "High index of suspicion in any elderly patient with sudden hemodynamic collapse. Time to OR, not diagnostic imaging, determines survival."
      },
      {
        "concept": "Contained vs Free Rupture",
        "explanation": "Contained rupture is tamponaded by retroperitoneal tissues, allowing time for diagnosis and treatment. Free rupture has no containment. Intraperitoneal rupture (free rupture) carries much higher mortality than retroperitoneal (often contained) rupture.",
        "clinical_significance": "Contained rupture patients may be awake and talking; free rupture patients are obtunded or in arrest. Treatment is dramatically different."
      },
      {
        "concept": "Resuscitative Strategy",
        "explanation": "Massive transfusion protocol activation is immediate. Balanced resuscitation with 1:1:1 PRBCs:FFP:platelets. Limit crystalloid. Goal is restoration of adequate perfusion without increasing blood pressure excessively before aortic control.",
        "clinical_significance": "Aggressive crystalloid resuscitation worsens dilutional coagulopathy and may pop the clot in partially contained ruptures."
      },
      {
        "concept": "Operative Approach",
        "explanation": "Supraceliac aortic control through left crus is fastest approach. May consider aortic balloon occlusion via femoral access (REBOA) as temporizing measure. Proximal control before entering hematoma is essential. Cell saver use if available.",
        "clinical_significance": "Entering the hematoma before proximal control leads to uncontrollable hemorrhage and death. The surgeon's primary goal is proximal control."
