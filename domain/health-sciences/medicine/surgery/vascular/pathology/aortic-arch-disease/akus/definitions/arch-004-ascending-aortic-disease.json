    "statement": {
      "text": "Ascending aortic disease encompasses aneurysmal and dissecting pathology of the aorta from the aortic valve annulus to the brachiocephalic artery origin. This segment is uniquely vulnerable due to hemodynamic stress from ventricular ejection, and disease here is frequently associated with aortic valve pathology and genetic connective tissue disorders. Surgical management typically requires cardiac surgery collaboration and may involve aortic root replacement (Bentall procedure), valve-sparing root replacement (David or Yacoub), or isolated ascending aortic replacement.",
      "formal": "Ascending Aortic Disease: Pathology from aortic annulus to innominate artery origin. Surgical options: Bentall (composite root), David/Yacoub (valve-sparing), or isolated ascending replacement. Typically cardiac surgery domain."
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "The ascending aorta is like the first section of a high-pressure water main right at the pump outlet - it takes the most force with every heartbeat. When this section weakens or tears, it's particularly dangerous because it's so close to the heart, the coronary arteries, and the aortic valve. Repair often means replacing not just the pipe, but also the valve and reattaching the coronary arteries - like replacing both the pump outlet and the connection points.",
      "key_insight": "Ascending aortic surgery crosses the boundary between vascular and cardiac surgery. Unlike descending thoracic or abdominal aortic surgery (primarily vascular surgery domain), ascending aortic surgery requires cardiopulmonary bypass, myocardial protection, and often valve expertise. Vascular surgeons must recognize when to involve cardiac surgical colleagues and understand the basic repair strategies.",
      "technical_details": "Ascending aortic aneurysms are categorized by involvement of the aortic root (sinuses of Valsalva) versus isolated ascending aorta. Root involvement typically requires composite graft replacement (Bentall: mechanical valve + graft with coronary reimplantation) or valve-sparing techniques (David reimplantation or Yacoub remodeling). Surgical thresholds vary: 5.5cm for degenerative aneurysm, 5.0cm with risk factors, 4.5cm for Marfan/Loeys-Dietz, and 4.0-4.5cm for bicuspid aortic valve with additional risk factors. Type A aortic dissection requires emergent surgery regardless of size."
