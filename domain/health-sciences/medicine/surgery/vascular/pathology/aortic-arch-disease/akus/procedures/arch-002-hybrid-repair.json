    "statement": {
      "text": "Hybrid aortic arch repair is a combined surgical and endovascular approach to treating arch pathology, designed to minimize the morbidity of full open arch replacement in high-risk patients. The procedure involves surgical extra-anatomic bypass (debranching) of the supra-aortic vessels (innominate, left carotid, left subclavian arteries) followed by thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) with stent-graft landing in the arch or ascending aorta. The extent of debranching determines the proximal landing zone achievable, with Zone 0 repair requiring complete arch debranching.",
      "formal": "Hybrid Arch Repair: Stage 1 = surgical supra-aortic vessel bypass from ascending aorta (via sternotomy or cervical incisions). Stage 2 = TEVAR with proximal landing in Zone 0-2 depending on debranching extent. May be performed as single-stage or staged procedures."
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Imagine needing to repair a highway overpass while keeping traffic flowing. One approach is to shut everything down and rebuild (open surgery with circulatory arrest). The hybrid approach is like building bypass roads first (debranching), then repairing the overpass section by section (TEVAR). It's less disruptive overall, though it requires two types of work: road construction and bridge repair.",
      "key_insight": "The fundamental trade-off is between the morbidity of circulatory arrest (avoided in hybrid repair) versus the complexity of creating surgical bypasses plus the risks of endovascular repair (endoleak, retrograde dissection). Patient selection is critical: hybrid repair is most valuable in high-risk patients who would not tolerate full open arch replacement.",
      "technical_details": "Debranching configurations vary based on extent of arch coverage needed. Zone 0 landing (ascending aorta) requires complete debranching of all arch vessels via median sternotomy, typically with a branched graft from the ascending aorta to the innominate, left carotid, and left subclavian arteries. Zone 1 landing requires innominate artery revascularization. Zone 2 landing requires left carotid revascularization. Less extensive debranching can sometimes be performed via cervical incisions (carotid-carotid-subclavian bypasses). TEVAR can be performed simultaneously or staged (days to weeks later)."
