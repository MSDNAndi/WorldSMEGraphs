    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Not every amputee can or wants to walk with a prosthesis. K-levels classify patients by their potential - from K0 (won't walk) to K4 (can run). This helps match the right prosthetic technology to the patient's abilities and goals.",
      "key_insight": "The K-level determines prosthetic prescription and coverage. K2 (limited community ambulator) is typically minimum for microprocessor knees. Pre-amputation mobility, cognition, and comorbidities predict post-amputation K-level.",
      "technical_details": "K-levels: K0 (non-ambulatory/household only without prosthesis), K1 (household ambulator), K2 (limited community - uneven terrain), K3 (community ambulator - varied speeds), K4 (exceeds basic ambulation - athletics). Factors predicting success: pre-amputation mobility, BKA vs AKA (BKA 70% ambulatory, AKA 30%), age, comorbidities, motivation. Prosthetic progression: immediate post-op (rigid dressing), preparatory prosthesis (6-8 weeks), definitive prosthesis (3-6 months)."
