    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "This is the most extreme form of lower limb amputation - removing the entire leg at the hip. It's performed when disease or infection extends too far proximal for above-knee amputation, essentially as a life-saving procedure.",
      "key_insight": "Hip disarticulation is primarily a life-saving procedure rather than a rehabilitative one. Ambulatory prosthetic use is rare (<5% achieve functional ambulation). Most patients become wheelchair-dependent.",
      "technical_details": "Indications: proximal thigh gangrene/infection, failed AKA, extensive vascular disease, trauma. Technique: anterior racquet incision, divide muscles, ligate femoral vessels, disarticulate hip joint. Major structures: femoral artery/vein, sciatic nerve, gluteal muscles. Mortality: 30-50% perioperative (reflects sick patient population). Prosthetics: Canadian hip prosthesis - complex, rarely used successfully."
