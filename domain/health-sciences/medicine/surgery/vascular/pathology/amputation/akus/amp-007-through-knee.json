    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Cutting through the joint (rather than bone) preserves the entire thigh bone for leverage and the condyles for weight-bearing. However, the bulbous shape at the knee makes prosthetic fitting awkward, limiting its use.",
      "key_insight": "Through-knee provides excellent lever arm and potential end-bearing through femoral condyles. The Gritti-Stokes modification fuses patella to femur for improved end-bearing. Primary limitation is prosthetic cosmesis and mechanics.",
      "technical_details": "Technique: knee disarticulation with posterior flap or sagittal flaps. Modifications: Gritti-Stokes (patella fused to intercondylar groove), Callander (condyles trimmed). Advantages: full femur lever arm, muscle insertions preserved, potential end-bearing. Disadvantages: bulky stump, prosthetic knee at different level than contralateral. Indications: poor BKA candidate, need for maximal lever arm, non-ambulatory patients."
