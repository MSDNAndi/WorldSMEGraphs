    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "The heel pad is uniquely designed to bear the body's weight with its specialized fat and fibrous tissue. By preserving this natural cushion and attaching it to the end of the tibia, patients can stand briefly without a prosthesis - like having a built-in pad.",
      "key_insight": "The key to successful Syme is meticulous preservation of the heel pad and its blood supply (posterior tibial artery). The heel pad must be centered under the tibia for proper end-bearing function.",
      "technical_details": "Technique: ankle joint disarticulated, malleoli shaved flush, heel flap developed preserving posterior tibial artery, heel pad sutured to anterior skin. Critical elements: (1) Viable heel pad (posterior tibial perfusion), (2) Smooth bone surface, (3) Centered heel pad positioning. Contraindications: non-functional heel pad, severe posterior tibial disease. Prosthetics: specialized Syme prosthesis with low-profile foot."
