    "statement": {
      "text": "AAA surveillance involves periodic imaging to monitor aneurysm growth and determine optimal timing for intervention. Guidelines recommend imaging intervals based on diameter: 3.0-3.9 cm every 3 years, 4.0-4.9 cm annually, and 5.0-5.4 cm every 6 months. Rapid growth (≥0.5 cm/6 months or ≥1 cm/year) warrants expedited intervention regardless of diameter.",
      "formal": "AAA Surveillance: <4cm q3yr, 4-4.9cm q12mo, 5-5.4cm q6mo; Rapid growth (≥0.5cm/6mo) = intervention threshold"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Managing a small AAA is like watching a slow-growing tumor - the goal is to act before it becomes dangerous while avoiding unnecessary surgery. Since small aneurysms rarely rupture but larger ones have increasing risk, we increase monitoring frequency as the aneurysm grows. We want to catch the 'inflection point' where benefits of repair outweigh risks.",
      "key_insight": "The threshold for intervention (5.5 cm in men, 5.0 cm in women) is chosen because the annual rupture risk at these sizes begins to exceed the operative mortality. Surveillance allows personalization - a fast-growing 4.5 cm AAA may warrant earlier repair than a stable 5.0 cm AAA.",
      "technical_details": "Ultrasound is the preferred modality for surveillance of small AAAs due to low cost, no radiation, and reproducibility. CT is indicated when nearing intervention threshold or if ultrasound is limited. Measurements should be consistent (same modality, same measurement technique) across time. Growth rate calculation requires at least 6-12 months between measurements to minimize measurement error impact.",
      "common_misconceptions": [
        "All AAAs require CT surveillance - ultrasound is sufficient for most small aneurysms",
        "Diameter is the only factor - growth rate and symptoms also guide timing",
        "Male and female thresholds are the same - women have 5.0 cm threshold due to higher rupture risk",
        "Once stable, surveillance can stop - lifelong monitoring is recommended"
