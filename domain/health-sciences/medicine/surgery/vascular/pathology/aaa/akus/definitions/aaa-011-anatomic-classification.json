    "statement": {
      "text": "Abdominal aortic aneurysms are classified by their anatomic relationship to the renal arteries: infrarenal (below renal arteries with adequate neck), juxtarenal (involving renal artery origins), pararenal (involving SMA origin), and suprarenal (extending above SMA). This classification determines surgical approach and complexity.",
      "formal": "AAA Anatomic Types: Infrarenal (95%), Juxtarenal (3-4%), Pararenal, Suprarenal (1-2%); Classification based on relationship to visceral vessels"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Picture the abdominal aorta as a highway with major exits (the renal and mesenteric arteries). Where the aneurysm starts relative to these exits determines how complicated the repair will be. If the balloon starts well below the kidney exits (infrarenal), repair is straightforward. If it starts right at or above those exits, the surgeon must work around or replant those critical blood vessels.",
      "key_insight": "The term 'neck' refers to the normal segment of aorta between the renal arteries and the aneurysm - a minimum of 10-15mm is typically required for standard EVAR. The absence of an adequate neck defines juxtarenal disease and necessitates more complex repair strategies.",
      "technical_details": "Infrarenal AAA (95% of cases) has ≥10-15mm of normal aorta below the renal arteries. Juxtarenal AAA has <10mm neck or aneurysm reaching the renal arteries but not involving them. Pararenal involves the renal arteries. Suprarenal extends above the SMA. Type IV thoracoabdominal aneurysm (Crawford) involves the entire abdominal aorta including visceral segment.",
      "common_misconceptions": [
        "All AAAs can be treated with standard EVAR - only infrarenal with adequate anatomy qualifies",
        "Juxtarenal is the same as suprarenal - they require different repair approaches",
        "The neck length doesn't matter for open repair - it affects clamp position and complexity"
