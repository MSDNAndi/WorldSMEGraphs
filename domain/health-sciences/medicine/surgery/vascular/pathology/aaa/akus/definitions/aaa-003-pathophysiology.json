    "statement": {
      "text": "AAA pathophysiology involves progressive degradation of elastin and collagen in the aortic media through matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activity, chronic inflammation with T-lymphocyte and macrophage infiltration, smooth muscle cell apoptosis, and increased wall stress per Laplace's law. The result is irreversible wall weakening and progressive dilation.",
      "formal": "AAA Formation = MMP-mediated ECM degradation + Chronic inflammation + SMC apoptosis + Oxidative stress → Wall weakening → Wall stress (T = P × r) exceeds wall strength → Progressive dilation"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "The aortic wall is like a rope made of three types of fibers: elastin (provides stretch and recoil), collagen (provides strength), and smooth muscle (maintains tone). In AAA, enzymes called MMPs start cutting through these fibers faster than the body can repair them. Meanwhile, inflammatory cells invade and accelerate the damage. As the wall weakens, blood pressure causes it to balloon outward - and Laplace's law means larger diameters create even more wall stress, accelerating the vicious cycle.",
      "key_insight": "AAA is not just 'atherosclerosis of the aorta' - it's a distinct process. While atherosclerosis involves lipid accumulation and plaque formation, AAA involves actual destruction of the structural wall components. This explains why risk factors overlap but treatments differ fundamentally.",
      "technical_details": "Key molecular events: (1) MMP-2 and MMP-9 degrade elastin in the media; (2) Tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) are overwhelmed; (3) CD4+ T-lymphocytes and macrophages produce pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-6); (4) Reactive oxygen species from oxidative stress damage wall components; (5) Smooth muscle cells undergo apoptosis, reducing wall cellular support; (6) Adventitial neovascularization provides inflammatory cell access. The infrarenal aorta is vulnerable because it has fewer vasa vasorum, lower elastin content, and is exposed to reflected pressure waves from the aortic bifurcation.",
      "common_misconceptions": [
        "AAA is caused by atherosclerosis - they are distinct processes that often coexist",
        "AAA is just stretching - it involves actual tissue destruction",
        "All parts of the aorta are equally susceptible - infrarenal is most vulnerable",
        "Aneurysm formation is acute - it's a chronic degenerative process"
