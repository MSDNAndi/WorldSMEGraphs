    "statement": {
      "text": "AAA natural history follows a predictable pattern: average growth rate is 2-3 mm/year for small aneurysms, accelerating with larger diameters. Rupture risk is size-dependent: <1% per year for AAAs <5 cm, increasing exponentially to 20-40% per year for AAAs ≥7 cm. The majority of AAAs are discovered incidentally and remain asymptomatic until rupture.",
      "formal": "AAA Growth Rate: ~0.2-0.3 cm/year (small), ~0.4-0.5 cm/year (large) | Rupture Risk per Year: <5cm: <1%, 5-6cm: 3-15%, 6-7cm: 10-20%, >7cm: 20-40%"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Imagine an AAA as a slowly inflating balloon. Small balloons need a lot of air to expand noticeably, but as the balloon gets bigger, the same amount of air causes larger expansion. Similarly, small AAAs grow slowly, but larger ones grow faster because of Laplace's law - the wall stress is greater at larger diameters. The rupture risk follows the same pattern: a small balloon can hold pressure, but as it stretches, the wall gets thinner and weaker until eventually it bursts.",
      "key_insight": "The 5.5 cm threshold for intervention in men (5.0 cm in women) represents the diameter at which the risk of rupture begins to exceed the risk of elective repair. Below this threshold, the natural history favors surveillance. Above it, the natural history favors intervention.",
      "technical_details": "Growth rate acceleration: AAAs <4 cm grow ~1-2 mm/year, 4-5 cm grow ~2-3 mm/year, >5 cm grow ~4-5 mm/year. Rupture occurs when wall stress exceeds wall strength. Wall stress increases with diameter (Laplace) while wall strength decreases (wall thinning, matrix degradation). Women have smaller aortas, so a 5 cm AAA represents relatively greater dilation. Rupture-free survival without repair: at 5 years, 50% for 5-6 cm AAAs, 20% for >6 cm. Rapid expansion (>1 cm/year) indicates unstable aneurysm requiring intervention regardless of size.",
      "common_misconceptions": [
        "All AAAs grow at the same rate - larger ones grow faster",
        "AAAs under 5 cm never rupture - they can, but risk is low",
        "AAA growth is linear - it's actually exponential with size",
        "Once stable, AAAs remain stable - growth can accelerate unpredictably"
