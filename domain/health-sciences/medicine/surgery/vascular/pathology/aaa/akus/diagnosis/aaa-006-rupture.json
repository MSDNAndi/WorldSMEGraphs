    "statement": {
      "text": "Ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm is a vascular emergency with 80-90% overall mortality. The classic triad of abdominal/back pain, hypotension, and pulsatile abdominal mass is present in only ~50% of cases. Most ruptures are posterior into the retroperitoneum, which may provide temporary tamponade. Immediate surgical repair (open or EVAR) is the only life-saving intervention.",
      "formal": "Ruptured AAA: Classic Triad (50%): Abdominal/back pain + Hypotension + Pulsatile mass | Mortality: 50% prehospital, 80-90% overall | Treatment: Emergency OR (open repair or EVAR if hemodynamically stable)"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "When an aortic aneurysm ruptures, blood escapes under high pressure into the surrounding space. If it ruptures forward into the abdominal cavity (free rupture), death occurs within minutes from massive hemorrhage. More commonly, it ruptures backward into the retroperitoneum, where the tissues temporarily contain the bleeding like a pressure bandage. This 'contained rupture' gives a window for rescue, but it's brief - the tamponade will fail.",
      "key_insight": "Speed is everything in ruptured AAA. Half of patients die before reaching the hospital. Of those who make it, every hour of delay increases mortality. The mantra is 'diagnose fast, operate faster.' A hemodynamically unstable patient with known or suspected AAA goes directly to the operating room - CT is only for stable patients where diagnosis is uncertain.",
      "technical_details": "Rupture patterns: (1) Posterior/retroperitoneal (80%) - may be temporarily contained; (2) Anterior/intraperitoneal (20%) - rapidly fatal free rupture; (3) Aortocaval fistula (<5%) - high-output cardiac failure; (4) Aortoenteric fistula (rare) - GI hemorrhage. Hemodynamic instability with suspected rupture should trigger 'massive transfusion protocol.' Permissive hypotension (SBP 70-90 mmHg) may help avoid disrupting retroperitoneal tamponade. EVAR for rupture (rEVAR) has emerged as an option for hemodynamically stable patients with suitable anatomy, with potential mortality benefit.",
      "common_misconceptions": [
        "All ruptured AAAs have the classic triad - only ~50% do",
        "CT is required before surgery - not in unstable patients",
        "Open repair is always needed - rEVAR is an option for stable patients",
        "Survival is hopeless - operative survival is 50-60% if patient reaches OR"
