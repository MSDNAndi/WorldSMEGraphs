    "statement": {
      "text": "Most AAAs (75-80%) are asymptomatic and discovered incidentally on imaging. When symptomatic, presentation ranges from vague abdominal or back discomfort to the classic ruptured AAA triad: abdominal pain, pulsatile abdominal mass, and hypotension. Physical examination sensitivity is limited by obesity and aneurysm size.",
      "formal": "AAA Presentations: Asymptomatic (75-80%) | Symptomatic Intact (5-10%): back/abdominal pain, embolic phenomena | Ruptured (15-20%): Classic triad (pain + pulsatile mass + hypotension) in ~50%"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Most people with AAA have no idea they have it - the aneurysm sits silently in the back of the abdomen, protected by intestines and growing slowly. It's only when the aneurysm stretches the surrounding tissues, erodes into adjacent structures, or ruptures that symptoms appear. Unfortunately, the first symptom is often rupture, which is frequently fatal.",
      "key_insight": "The challenge of AAA is that symptoms often mean it's already an emergency. By the time a patient has the 'classic triad' of ruptured AAA, they're in a life-threatening situation with 50% mortality even if they reach the hospital. This is why screening and surveillance programs are so important.",
      "technical_details": "Physical examination for AAA has limited sensitivity: 29% for AAAs 3.0-3.9 cm, 50% for 4.0-4.9 cm, and 76% for >5.0 cm. Sensitivity is further reduced by obesity (BMI >30 reduces sensitivity by ~50%). The classic 'expansile' pulsatile mass (as opposed to transmitted pulsation from a non-aneurysmal aorta) has an estimated positive predictive value of 40-60% for AAA >3 cm. Symptomatic intact AAAs may present with: (1) Local symptoms from expansion (early satiety, nausea, urinary symptoms from compression); (2) Back pain from vertebral erosion; (3) Embolic phenomena (blue toe syndrome, trash foot); (4) Aortoenteric erosion (rare, GI bleeding).",
      "common_misconceptions": [
        "Patients will feel an AAA - most are completely asymptomatic",
        "Physical exam can reliably detect AAA - sensitivity is low, especially in obese patients",
        "Back pain in an elderly patient is just degenerative - consider AAA",
        "The classic triad is always present in rupture - only ~50% have all three components"
