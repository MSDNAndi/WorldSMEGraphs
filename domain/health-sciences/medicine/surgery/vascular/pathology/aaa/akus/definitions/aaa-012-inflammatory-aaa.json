      "text": "Inflammatory abdominal aortic aneurysm (IAAA) is a distinct variant characterized by marked thickening of the aneurysm wall (≥5mm), perianeurysmal fibrosis, and adhesion to adjacent structures including duodenum, ureters, and vena cava. IAAA represents 3-10% of all AAAs.",
      "formal": "IAAA: AAA + wall thickening ≥5mm + perianeurysmal fibrosis + adjacent structure involvement (duodenum, ureters, IVC)"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "While a typical aneurysm is like a thin-walled balloon, an inflammatory aneurysm is like a balloon wrapped in thick scar tissue that glues it to everything around it. This dense inflammatory reaction makes surgery more difficult because the normal tissue planes are obliterated - the aneurysm becomes 'stuck' to the intestine, the tube carrying urine from kidney to bladder, and major veins.",
      "key_insight": "The inflammatory process is thought to represent an autoimmune reaction to atherosclerotic debris in the aneurysm wall. Despite its name, IAAA is not primarily an infectious process. The fibrosis typically regresses after successful aneurysm repair.",
      "technical_details": "Histologically, IAAA shows marked adventitial and periadventitial fibrosis with lymphoplasmacytic infiltration. The inflammation extends into surrounding retroperitoneum. Associated IgG4-related disease should be considered, especially with other manifestations. CT characteristically shows a 'rim sign' - enhancing thickened aortic wall with surrounding soft tissue.",
      "common_misconceptions": [
        "IAAA is an infected aneurysm - it is autoimmune/inflammatory, not infectious",
        "All IAAA need open repair - EVAR may be appropriate if anatomy permits",
        "Steroids are always required - medical therapy is adjunctive, not definitive",
        "IAAA has higher rupture risk - rupture risk is similar to standard AAA by size"
