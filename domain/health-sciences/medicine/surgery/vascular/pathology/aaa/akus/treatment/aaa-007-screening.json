      "text": "The US Preventive Services Task Force recommends one-time screening ultrasound for AAA in men ages 65-75 who have ever smoked. Screening has been shown to reduce AAA-related mortality by 42% in invited populations. Screening of women is not routinely recommended due to lower prevalence, though selective screening may be considered in women 65-75 with smoking history or family history.",
      "formal": "USPSTF AAA Screening: Men 65-75 + Ever smoked → Grade B recommendation (one-time ultrasound) | Men 65-75 + Never smoked → Grade C (selective) | Women 65-75 + Ever smoked → Grade I (insufficient evidence) | Women 65-75 + Never smoked → Grade D (do not screen)"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "AAA is a 'silent killer' - most patients have no symptoms until rupture, which is usually fatal. Screening catches aneurysms while they're small enough to safely monitor or electively repair, rather than waiting for catastrophic rupture. A simple 10-minute ultrasound can identify a potentially fatal condition years before it becomes an emergency.",
      "key_insight": "Screening only works if the condition is common enough in the screened population to justify the cost and follow-up. AAA is common in older male smokers (~7%) but rare in never-smoking women (<0.5%). This is why screening recommendations are targeted, not universal.",
      "technical_details": "Major trials proving screening benefit: (1) MASS trial (UK) - 42% reduction in AAA mortality at 10 years; (2) Viborg (Denmark) - 67% reduction in AAA mortality; (3) Western Australia - 41% reduction in rupture. The number needed to screen (NNS) to prevent one AAA-related death is ~300-400 men over 10 years. Screening is cost-effective at ~$10,000-15,000 per life-year gained. Ultrasound is 95-100% sensitive and 99% specific for AAA detection. Medicare covers one-time screening for eligible patients.",
      "common_misconceptions": [
        "All elderly patients should be screened - only certain high-risk populations benefit",
        "Women don't get AAA - they do, but it's much less common",
        "Screening should be repeated - one-time screening is sufficient if normal",
        "Finding a small AAA requires immediate surgery - most are monitored"
