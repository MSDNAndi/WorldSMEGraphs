    "statement": {
      "text": "Preoperative risk stratification for AAA repair involves assessment of cardiac risk (most common cause of perioperative mortality), pulmonary function, renal function, and overall physiologic reserve. Tools include cardiac stress testing, VQI risk calculator, Glasgow Aneurysm Score, and frailty assessment. This guides the choice between EVAR and open repair.",
      "formal": "AAA Risk Stratification: Cardiac risk (stress test if indicated), Pulmonary (FEV1, DLCO), Renal (eGFR), Frailty assessment; Informs EVAR vs Open selection"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Before recommending major surgery, we need to know if the patient can survive the operation. Think of it like checking if a bridge can support a truck before driving across. For AAA, the heart is the most common weak point - many patients have silent coronary disease. We also assess lungs, kidneys, and overall 'physiologic reserve' to choose the safest approach.",
      "key_insight": "The goal is to select patients where operative mortality is lower than the aneurysm's annual rupture risk. For a 5.5 cm AAA with ~5% annual rupture risk, repair is only beneficial if operative mortality is expected to be substantially lower than 5%. For very high-risk patients, conservative management or EVAR (if anatomically suitable) may be preferred.",
      "technical_details": "Cardiac evaluation follows ACC/AHA guidelines: functional capacity ≥4 METs without symptoms usually precludes further testing. Pharmacologic stress testing or coronary angiography for those with active cardiac conditions or poor functional status. The VQI AAA risk calculator provides procedure-specific mortality estimates. Frailty (assessed by 5-meter walk time, grip strength, albumin) independently predicts outcomes.",
      "common_misconceptions": [
        "All AAA patients need cardiac catheterization - only those with significant risk factors or symptoms",
        "EVAR eliminates operative risk - it reduces but does not eliminate perioperative mortality",
        "Age alone determines risk - physiologic age and comorbidities matter more than chronologic age",
        "Risk assessment delays necessary surgery - it guides optimal treatment selection"
