    "statement": {
      "text": "A juxtarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is an aneurysm that extends to involve the aorta immediately inferior to the renal arteries, with an inadequate infrarenal aortic neck (typically less than 10-15mm) for standard infrarenal repair. The renal arteries themselves are not incorporated into the aneurysm sac, distinguishing this entity from pararenal and suprarenal aneurysms. This anatomic configuration requires either suprarenal aortic clamping for open repair or advanced endovascular techniques such as fenestrated endografts.",
      "formal": "Juxtarenal AAA: Infrarenal aortic aneurysm with proximal neck <10-15mm below lowest renal artery, necessitating suprarenal clamping or fenestrated/branched endovascular repair."
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Imagine needing to sew a patch onto a garden hose very close to a branch point. If you clamp the hose below the branch, you don't have enough healthy hose to work with. You must clamp above the branch, temporarily stopping flow to it. In juxtarenal AAA, the aneurysm comes so close to the renal arteries that surgeons must clamp above the kidneys, temporarily interrupting renal blood flow, which adds significant complexity and risk to the repair.",
      "key_insight": "The critical distinction lies in the infrarenal neck length. Standard EVAR requires at least 10-15mm of healthy aorta below the renals for adequate seal. When this length is insufficient, the procedure fundamentally changes from a relatively straightforward infrarenal repair to a complex suprarenal procedure with inherent renal ischemia risk.",
      "technical_details": "Infrarenal neck adequacy is assessed by multiple criteria: length (minimum 10-15mm), diameter (<28-32mm depending on device), angulation (<60° for most devices), circumferential thrombus (<2mm thickness), and shape (cylindrical preferred over conical). Juxtarenal anatomy may also include accessory renal arteries in up to 30% of patients, further complicating repair. Open repair requires suprarenal cross-clamping with deliberate renal ischemia, managed through cold crystalloid perfusion (4°C solution containing mannitol and furosemide), which extends safe ischemia time from approximately 25 minutes to over 45 minutes. Fenestrated EVAR (FEVAR) represents the modern endovascular solution, utilizing custom-manufactured grafts with fenestrations aligned with renal artery orifices, allowing maintained renal perfusion during and after deployment.",
      "common_misconceptions": [
        "Juxtarenal and pararenal AAA are the same entity - pararenal involves the renal artery origins",
        "All juxtarenal AAAs require open repair - fenestrated EVAR is now first-line in many centers",
        "Suprarenal clamping always causes permanent renal injury - most patients have temporary dysfunction only",
        "Neck angulation is unimportant if length is adequate - severe angulation can preclude endovascular repair"
