    "statement": {
      "text": "A mycotic (infected) aortic aneurysm is a localized, infected outpouching of the aortic wall resulting from bacterial seeding of atherosclerotic plaque, adjacent infected tissue, septic emboli, or direct trauma. Despite the name, most are bacterial (not fungal) in origin, with Salmonella and Staphylococcus being most common.",
      "formal": "Mycotic Aneurysm: Infected arterial dilation from bacterial seeding. Common organisms: Salmonella spp. (especially elderly), Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus spp."
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Think of a mycotic aneurysm as an abscess that forms in the wall of a major blood vessel. Bacteria land on a vulnerable area (usually a diseased plaque) and start to digest the arterial wall, causing it to weaken and balloon outward rapidly. This is a surgical emergency because the infected, weakened wall has a very high risk of rupture.",
      "key_insight": "The term 'mycotic' is a misnomer coined by Osler in 1885 because the aneurysms resembled fungal vegetations. The vast majority are actually caused by bacteria, not fungi. Salmonella has a particular tropism for atherosclerotic aorta in elderly patients.",
      "technical_details": "Mycotic aneurysms are saccular, eccentric, and rapidly enlarging. They occur in atypical locations for degenerative aneurysms (e.g., suprarenal, pararenal aorta). Blood cultures are positive in 50-75%. CT findings include periaortic gas, fluid, soft tissue stranding, and saccular morphology. Treatment requires both surgical repair and prolonged (often lifelong) antibiotic therapy.",
      "common_misconceptions": [
        "Mycotic means fungal - most are bacterial",
        "All infected aneurysms are mycotic - graft infection is a distinct entity",
        "EVAR is contraindicated - may be used as bridge in unstable patients",
        "Rupture can be prevented with antibiotics alone - surgical repair is essential"
