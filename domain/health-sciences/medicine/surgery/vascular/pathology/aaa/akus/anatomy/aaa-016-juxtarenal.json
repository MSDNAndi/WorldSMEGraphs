    "description": "An abdominal aortic aneurysm that extends to involve the aorta immediately below the renal arteries, leaving insufficient infrarenal neck for standard endovascular repair.",
    "definition": "Juxtarenal AAA is defined as an aneurysm where the proximal extent reaches the level of the renal arteries but does not involve them, with less than 10-15mm of infrarenal aortic neck. This anatomic pattern presents unique challenges for both open and endovascular repair due to the need for suprarenal clamping or specialized endografts.",
