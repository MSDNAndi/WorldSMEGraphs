    "statement": {
      "text": "Elective AAA repair is indicated for aneurysm diameter ≥5.5 cm in men and ≥5.0 cm in women, rapid expansion ≥0.5 cm in 6 months, or symptoms attributable to the aneurysm. The decision balances rupture risk against operative risk. Repair is recommended when rupture risk exceeds operative mortality - typically 2-3%/year rupture risk threshold compared to 2-4% perioperative mortality for elective EVAR/open repair.",
      "formal": "Repair Indications: Diameter ≥5.5 cm (men) | ≥5.0 cm (women) | Growth ≥0.5 cm/6 months | Symptomatic aneurysm | Saccular morphology | Decision: Rupture risk > Operative risk"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "The decision to repair an AAA is like deciding when to fix a slowly bulging tire. A small bulge can be monitored safely. But at some point, the risk of a blowout (rupture) becomes high enough that it outweighs the risks of repair. That tipping point is around 5.5 cm for men. Below 5 cm, rupture risk is very low (~1%/year), but above 5.5 cm it climbs rapidly (~10%/year at 6 cm, 25%+ at 7 cm).",
      "key_insight": "There's no magic diameter at which rupture occurs - 5.5 cm is the threshold where rupture risk begins to exceed operative risk for most patients. Individual factors matter: women have higher rupture risk at smaller sizes (hence the 5.0 cm threshold), patients with high operative risk may benefit from a higher threshold, and saccular/rapidly expanding aneurysms warrant earlier repair.",
      "technical_details": "Rupture risk by size: <4 cm = 0%/year; 4.0-4.9 cm = 0.5-1%/year; 5.0-5.9 cm = 3-15%/year; 6.0-6.9 cm = 10-20%/year; ≥7 cm = 20-32%/year. Key trials: UK Small Aneurysm Trial and ADAM trial showed no survival benefit to early repair of 4.0-5.5 cm AAA vs surveillance. Women have 3-4x higher rupture risk at same diameter - hence lower threshold. Operative mortality: EVAR 1-2%, open 3-5% at high-volume centers. Patient factors affecting threshold: life expectancy (<2-5 years may not benefit), fitness for surgery, anatomy (suitable for EVAR?), patient preference.",
      "common_misconceptions": [
        "Every AAA eventually needs repair - many patients die of other causes first",
        "5.5 cm is a hard cutoff - it's a guideline balancing risks, not a mandate",
        "Women use the same size threshold - women have higher rupture risk, lower threshold",
        "Small aneurysms never rupture - rare but possible, especially if symptomatic"
