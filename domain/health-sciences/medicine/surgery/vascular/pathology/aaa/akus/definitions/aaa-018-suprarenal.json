      "text": "A suprarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm extends above both renal arteries to involve the visceral aortic segment, including the origins of the celiac axis and/or superior mesenteric artery (SMA). This represents the most complex subtype of abdominal aortic aneurysm, requiring reconstruction of multiple visceral vessels during repair. Suprarenal AAA bridges the gap between standard abdominal aneurysms and type IV thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms, sharing surgical complexity with the latter while being approached primarily through abdominal incisions.",
      "formal": "Suprarenal AAA: Aneurysm extending above both renal arteries to involve the visceral segment (celiac and/or SMA origins), requiring visceral reconstruction and representing transition to thoracoabdominal pathology."
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Imagine a section of water main that's swollen and damaged not just near the branch points to individual houses (kidneys), but also the major branches feeding entire neighborhoods (intestines, stomach, liver, spleen). Replacing this section means reconnecting all those major branch lines while temporarily shutting off water to critical areas. The complexity increases dramatically with each additional branch that must be managed.",
      "key_insight": "Suprarenal AAA represents the most challenging anatomy within the abdominal aorta because it involves all visceral vessels - celiac, SMA, and renals. The repair requirements approach those of Crawford Extent IV thoracoabdominal aneurysms, with similar visceral ischemia times and reconstruction complexity. Patient selection for open vs endovascular repair requires careful assessment of physiologic reserve and anatomic suitability.",
      "technical_details": "Open repair requires supraceliac or supramesenteric clamping with visceral ischemia involving kidneys, liver, spleen, and intestines simultaneously. All visceral vessels require reconstruction, typically using the 'inclusion' technique with a Carrel patch for close origins or individual reimplantation/bypass for widely separated vessels. Fenestrated and branched EVAR (F/B-EVAR) allows endovascular treatment in suitable anatomy, with fenestrations for aligned vessels (renals) and branches for angulated vessels (SMA, celiac). Off-the-shelf devices for suprarenal anatomy are becoming available, reducing manufacturing delays."
