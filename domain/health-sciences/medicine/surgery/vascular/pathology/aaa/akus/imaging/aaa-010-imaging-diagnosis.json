      "text": "Imaging of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) utilizes multiple modalities: ultrasound (US) for screening and surveillance, CT angiography (CTA) for preoperative planning and anatomic characterization, and MR angiography (MRA) as an alternative when contrast nephrotoxicity is a concern.",
      "formal": "AAA Imaging Modalities: US (screening, surveillance), CTA (gold standard for planning), MRA (alternative for contrast-sensitive patients)"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Think of imaging AAA like photographing a bulging balloon from different angles. Ultrasound gives a quick, real-time view without radiation - perfect for regular checkups. CT with contrast provides detailed 3D images showing exactly how the aneurysm relates to other blood vessels - essential for surgical planning. MRI offers similar detail but without iodinated contrast, useful when kidney function is impaired.",
      "key_insight": "The choice of imaging modality depends on clinical context: ultrasound for screening and surveillance of small AAAs, CTA for symptomatic or large AAAs requiring intervention planning. Accurate sizing requires outer-wall-to-outer-wall measurement perpendicular to the flow lumen.",
      "technical_details": "Ultrasound sensitivity for AAA detection is >95% with specificity approaching 100%. CTA provides sub-millimeter resolution with multiplanar reconstructions and centerline measurements. Key anatomic features to assess include: neck length (distance from lowest renal artery to aneurysm), neck diameter, neck angle, iliac artery diameter and tortuosity, presence of thrombus, and accessory renal arteries.",
      "common_misconceptions": [
        "All AAAs need CT - small aneurysms can be monitored with ultrasound alone",
        "Any size measurement technique is acceptable - standardized protocols are essential",
        "Contrast is always needed - non-contrast CT can detect AAA but misses branch vessel detail",
        "MRA is inferior to CTA - MRA provides comparable accuracy for most planning purposes"
