      "text": "Abdominal aortic aneurysm affects 4-8% of men over 65 years and 0.5-1.5% of women over 65 years. Smoking is the strongest modifiable risk factor, increasing risk 5-8 fold. AAA accounts for approximately 15,000 deaths annually in the United States.",
      "formal": "AAA Prevalence: Men ≥65: 4-8%, Women ≥65: 0.5-1.5% | Major Risk Factors: Smoking (RR 5-8), Male sex (RR 4-6), Age >65, Family history (RR 2-4), Hypertension"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "AAA is fundamentally a disease of older men who smoke. The male predominance is striking - about 6 times more common in men than women. Smoking is so strongly associated that some call AAA a 'smoker's disease' - 90% of patients with AAA have a smoking history.",
      "key_insight": "The declining prevalence of AAA in developed countries correlates with declining smoking rates, confirming the causal relationship. However, as populations age, the absolute number of AAAs may still increase. Women tend to develop AAAs about 10 years later than men but have higher rupture risk at smaller diameters.",
      "technical_details": "Epidemiologic studies show AAA prevalence has decreased from ~5% to ~1.5% in screened populations over the past 20 years, paralleling smoking cessation trends. The heritability of AAA is estimated at 70%, with first-degree relatives having 2-4 fold increased risk. Associated conditions include peripheral arterial disease (40% have AAA), popliteal aneurysm (30-50% have AAA), and coronary artery disease. The incidence of ruptured AAA is approximately 5-10 per 100,000 person-years.",
      "common_misconceptions": [
        "AAA is rare - it's actually one of the most common vascular pathologies",
        "Only heavy smokers get AAA - any smoking history increases risk",
        "Women don't get AAA - they do, but less commonly and later in life",
        "AAA prevalence is increasing - it's actually declining in screened populations"
