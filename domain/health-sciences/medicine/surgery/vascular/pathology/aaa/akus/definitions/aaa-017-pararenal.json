    "statement": {
      "text": "A pararenal abdominal aortic aneurysm is an aneurysm that involves the aorta at the level of the renal artery origins, where one or both renal arteries arise from the aneurysmal segment itself. Unlike juxtarenal aneurysms (which have a short but uninvolved neck below the renals), pararenal aneurysms require reconstruction or reimplantation of the renal arteries during repair. This anatomic configuration demands either fenestrated/branched endovascular repair or open surgery with visceral vessel reimplantation.",
      "formal": "Pararenal AAA: Aneurysm involving the aorta at the level of one or both renal artery origins, requiring renal artery reconstruction or fenestrated endovascular repair for complete exclusion."
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Imagine a water pipe with a bulge that includes the branch point where two important side pipes connect. You can't simply replace the bulged section without also reconnecting those side pipes. In a pararenal AAA, the kidney arteries come directly off the aneurysm, so any repair must include a plan for maintaining blood flow to the kidneys - either by sewing them onto a new graft or by using special stent-grafts with holes (fenestrations) that allow blood to continue flowing to the kidneys.",
      "key_insight": "The defining characteristic distinguishing pararenal from juxtarenal AAA is whether the renal artery origins are within the aneurysm sac. Juxtarenal has a short neck but the renals come from normal aorta; pararenal has the renal origins embedded in the aneurysm. This distinction fundamentally changes the repair strategy from simple suprarenal clamping to mandatory renal artery reconstruction.",
      "technical_details": "Open repair requires suprarenal or supraceliac clamping with deliberate visceral ischemia. Renal arteries are reimplanted onto the graft, either as a Carrel patch (if origins are close together) or as individual bypass grafts. Cold crystalloid perfusion of the kidneys extends safe ischemia time. Fenestrated EVAR (FEVAR) represents the modern alternative, using custom-manufactured grafts with fenestrations precisely aligned to the renal artery orifices. Bridging stents extend from the fenestrations into the target vessels, maintaining renal perfusion. Chimney/snorkel techniques offer an off-the-shelf alternative with parallel grafts alongside the main endograft body."
