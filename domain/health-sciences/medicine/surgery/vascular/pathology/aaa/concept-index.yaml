  This is a prerequisite concept for EVAR and Type 2 Endoleak.
  Comprehensive AKUs to be developed covering:
  - Definition and diagnostic criteria
  - Epidemiology and risk factors
  - Natural history
  - Rupture risk stratification
  - Screening guidelines
  - Indications for repair
  - Open vs endovascular repair selection
