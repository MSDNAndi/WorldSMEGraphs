    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Extent IV is essentially a very proximal abdominal aneurysm that happens to reach above the celiac axis to the diaphragm. It's the 'smallest' TAAA and has the best outcomes because spinal cord perfusion risk is lowest.",
      "key_insight": "Extent IV has the lowest paraplegia risk (2-5%) of all TAAA types because the critical intercostal arteries (T8-L1) are typically not involved. However, it still requires visceral reimplantation or branch grafting.",
      "technical_details": "Crawford classification: Extent I (left subclavian to above renals), Extent II (subclavian to bifurcation - worst prognosis), Extent III (T6 to bifurcation), Extent IV (T12/diaphragm to bifurcation). Extent IV repair options: open with visceral patch, fenestrated/branched EVAR, or hybrid (visceral debranching + TEVAR). Spinal protection still recommended but paraplegia risk significantly lower than Extent II."
