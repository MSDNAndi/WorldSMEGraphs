    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Unlike contained rupture where the retroperitoneum tamponades bleeding, free rupture spills blood directly into the open belly cavity with nothing to slow the bleeding. It's like a broken pipe flooding an open field versus one flooding inside a wall cavity.",
      "key_insight": "Free rupture mortality exceeds 90% without emergent surgery. Patients present in profound shock, often without the classic triad (pain, pulsatile mass, hypotension) because they lose consciousness rapidly. Time from recognition to aortic control determines survival.",
      "technical_details": "Presentation: severe abdominal distension, profound hypotension, altered consciousness. Management: (1) Activate massive transfusion protocol, (2) Permissive hypotension (SBP 70-80) until aortic control, (3) Emergent OR - supraceliac aortic control, (4) Avoid pre-op imaging if unstable. Open repair with rapid proximal control preferred; EVAR possible in select hemodynamically tolerant patients. Damage control: supraceliac clamp, pack abdomen, resuscitate in ICU, return for definitive repair."
