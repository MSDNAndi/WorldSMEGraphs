      "text": "Motor evoked potentials (MEPs) are intraoperative neurophysiologic monitoring that detects spinal cord ischemia by measuring motor pathway integrity from cortex to muscle, allowing real-time intervention to prevent paraplegia during aortic surgery.",

    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "MEPs are like a real-time 'test call' through the spinal cord's motor highway. A magnetic pulse stimulates the brain, and if the signal arrives normally at leg muscles, the cord is getting enough blood. Signal loss is an alarm that the cord is at risk.",
      "key_insight": "MEP monitors the anterior cord (motor pathways) which is most vulnerable to ischemia. A >75% amplitude decrease or loss of response signals impending cord injury, prompting immediate intervention (raise blood pressure, reimplant intercostals, CSF drain).",
      "technical_details": "Technique: transcranial electrical stimulation of motor cortex with recording from limb muscles (tibialis anterior, abductor hallucis). Requires total IV anesthesia (no paralytic agents). Sensitive to: blood pressure, temperature, anesthetic depth, cord ischemia. Response to signal loss: raise MAP to 90-100mmHg, drain CSF to <10mmHg, reimplant critical intercostals. Combined with SSEPs (sensory evoked potentials) for comprehensive cord monitoring."
