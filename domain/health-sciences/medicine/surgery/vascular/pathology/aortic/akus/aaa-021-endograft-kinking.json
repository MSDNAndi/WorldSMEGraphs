    "statement": {
      "text": "Endograft limb kinking is a mechanical complication of EVAR occurring when graft limbs fold or angulate, typically at the iliac arteries, causing flow restriction or occlusion that requires reintervention.",
      "formal": "Kinking_Risk ∝ (Iliac_Tortuosity × Length_Mismatch) / Device_Flexibility"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "When a relatively rigid fabric-covered stent is placed in a curved or tortuous vessel, the graft can buckle inward at the bend points, like a garden hose folding when bent sharply.",
      "key_insight": "Kinking occurs most commonly in the external iliac artery where vessel tortuosity is greatest. It may be immediate (technical error) or delayed (progressive aneurysm sac remodeling changing graft geometry).",
      "technical_details": "Risk factors include severe iliac tortuosity (>90° angulation), narrow aortic bifurcation, long unsupported limb segments, and undersized limb diameter. Prevention involves careful preoperative planning, selecting appropriate limb lengths, considering flared limbs, and adding kissing stents when needed. Treatment options include balloon angioplasty with kissing stents, bare metal stent reinforcement, or limb extension with new covered stent."
