    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "The innominate artery supplies the right arm and right side of the brain. When replacing or covering the aortic arch, you must maintain this blood supply - either by sewing it into the new graft or bypassing it before covering with an endograft.",
      "key_insight": "Zone 0 arch coverage requires innominate revascularization. Hybrid approach uses ascending aortic bypass; total arch replacement uses direct reimplantation with island or separate branches under circulatory arrest.",
      "technical_details": "Approaches: (1) Open total arch - reimplant as island with LCCA/LSCA or as separate anastomoses (branched graft), (2) Hybrid debranching - ascending aorta to innominate bypass (8-10mm Dacron), (3) Extra-anatomic - carotid-carotid bypass with innominate ligation. Circulatory arrest strategies: deep hypothermia, antegrade cerebral perfusion through axillary cannulation. Stroke risk 3-10% with arch procedures."
