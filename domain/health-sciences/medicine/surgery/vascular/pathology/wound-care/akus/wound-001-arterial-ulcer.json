      "text": "Arterial ulcers result from inadequate tissue perfusion in PAD/CLTI, characterized by painful, punched-out wounds on pressure points with pale base and minimal granulation, requiring revascularization for healing.",
      "formal": "Location: Distal toes, lateral malleolus, pressure points; Characteristics: Punched-out, pale base, painful, minimal exudate; Treatment: Revascularization is primary therapy"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "When arteries can't deliver enough blood, the tissue at the farthest points (toes, heels) starves and dies, creating wounds that look 'punched out' and won't heal no matter how good the wound care is - the blood supply must be fixed first.",
      "key_insight": "Arterial ulcers don't heal with wound care alone - revascularization is mandatory for healing.",
      "technical_details": "Arterial ulcers develop when tissue perfusion falls below the threshold needed for cellular viability (typically toe pressure <30 mmHg or TcPO2 <30 mmHg). They appear on areas vulnerable to pressure and trauma: toes, lateral malleolus, heel, and metatarsal heads. The wound bed is characteristically pale or necrotic, dry with minimal exudate, and painful (unless neuropathy coexists). Surrounding skin may show dependent rubor and elevation pallor. Treatment centers on revascularization; wound care alone is futile without adequate perfusion.",
