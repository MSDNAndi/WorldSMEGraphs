        "term": "Pathophysiology",

        "term": "Claudication Distance",

        "term": "Differential Diagnosis",

        "term": "Ankle-Brachial Index",
        "description": "ABI 0.4-0.9 typical for claudication; <0.4 suggests critical limb ischemia; Exercise ABI (post-treadmill) may unmask disease in patients with normal resting ABI"

        "term": "Conservative Management",
        "description": "First-line treatment: smoking cessation (most important), supervised exercise therapy (SET - 30-45 min, 3x/week for 12+ weeks), risk factor modification (statins, antihypertensives, antiplatelet therapy)"
