    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Saving a threatened limb is like putting out a complex fire - you need multiple specialists working together. The vascular surgeon restores blood flow, but you also need someone to offload pressure, control infection, manage diabetes, and rehabilitate the patient.",
      "key_insight": "Limb salvage rates improve significantly (30-50% reduction in major amputation) when care is coordinated through a multidisciplinary team rather than siloed specialists. The team approach ensures no critical element (perfusion, infection, offloading, glycemic control) is neglected.",
      "technical_details": "Core team: vascular surgeon (revascularization), podiatrist (debridement, offloading, minor amputation), wound care specialist (advanced therapies), infectious disease (antibiotic stewardship), endocrinologist (diabetes optimization). Extended team: orthopedic surgeon, plastic surgery, prosthetist, physical therapy, social work, nutrition. Structure: regular case conferences, shared protocols, expedited referral pathways, quality metrics tracking."
