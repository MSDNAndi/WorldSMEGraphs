    "statement": {
      "text": "Popliteal-tibial bypass connects the popliteal artery to a tibial vessel using autogenous vein, providing limb salvage for CLTI patients with combined femoropopliteal and tibial disease when adequate popliteal inflow exists.",
      "formal": "Inflow: Above or below knee popliteal; Outflow: AT, PT, or peroneal; Conduit: Autogenous vein mandatory; Patency: 60-70% at 5 years with vein"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "When the popliteal artery has good flow but disease blocks the tibial arteries, a shorter bypass from the popliteal to a tibial vessel can restore blood flow to the foot. Using a short segment of vein from a healthy popliteal inflow improves durability.",
      "key_insight": "A short popliteal-tibial bypass with vein often outperforms a long femorotibial bypass - 'the shorter the better' principle for distal bypasses.",
      "technical_details": "Popliteal-tibial bypass uses the popliteal artery as inflow when it is free of hemodynamically significant disease. The bypass targets whichever tibial vessel provides the best outflow to the wound angiosome. Above-knee popliteal inflow is preferred when available, though below-knee popliteal can serve. Autogenous vein is mandatory - great saphenous vein is first choice, with arm veins or spliced conduit as alternatives. Reversed or in-situ vein techniques may be used.",
      "common_misconceptions": [
        "Longer bypasses are better for durability - FALSE, shorter bypasses have better patency",
        "Prosthetic conduit is acceptable for tibial targets - FALSE, vein is mandatory",
        "Any tibial vessel is equivalent - FALSE, angiosome targeting matters",
        "Below-knee popliteal inflow is inadequate - FALSE, can be excellent inflow source"
