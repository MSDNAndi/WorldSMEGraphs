      "text": "Pentoxifylline is a methylxanthine derivative that improves blood flow by decreasing blood viscosity and improving red blood cell deformability, though its clinical efficacy for claudication is modest and inferior to cilostazol.",

    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Pentoxifylline makes blood 'thinner' and red blood cells more flexible so they can squeeze through narrowed arteries more easily. However, the clinical benefit is small - patients might walk slightly further but the effect is often disappointing.",
      "key_insight": "Pentoxifylline is FDA-approved for claudication but guidelines give it weak recommendation (IIb) due to modest efficacy. Cilostazol is preferred first-line. Pentoxifylline may be considered when cilostazol is contraindicated (heart failure).",
      "technical_details": "Mechanism: phosphodiesterase inhibitor increasing cAMP in RBCs, platelets, and endothelium. Effects: decreased blood viscosity, improved RBC deformability, decreased platelet aggregation, decreased fibrinogen. Dosing: 400mg TID with meals. Side effects: nausea, headache, dizziness. Contraindications: recent cerebral/retinal hemorrhage. Meta-analyses show marginal improvement in walking distance (50-60 meters) compared to placebo."
