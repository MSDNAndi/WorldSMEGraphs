      "text": "Drug-coated balloons (DCBs) deliver antiproliferative agents (paclitaxel) to the vessel wall during angioplasty, reducing restenosis rates compared to plain balloon angioplasty in femoropopliteal disease.",
      "formal": "Restenosis reduction: 30-50% relative reduction vs POBA; Primary patency improvement: 70-85% at 1 year; Optimal for: Femoropopliteal, post-atherectomy, in-stent restenosis"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "After balloon angioplasty, the vessel wall heals by forming scar tissue (neointimal hyperplasia) that can re-narrow the artery. By coating the balloon with an anti-scarring drug, we deliver medication directly to the treatment site, preventing excessive healing response.",
      "key_insight": "DCBs provide the benefits of drug therapy without leaving a permanent implant, preserving future treatment options.",
      "technical_details": "Drug-coated balloons use paclitaxel (typically 2-3.5 μg/mm²) bound to an excipient carrier (urea, shellac, or other proprietary formulations) that facilitates drug transfer to the vessel wall during balloon inflation. The drug inhibits smooth muscle cell proliferation and migration, reducing neointimal hyperplasia. Inflation times of 60-180 seconds optimize drug transfer. Vessel preparation with predilation or atherectomy improves drug uptake and outcomes.",
      "common_misconceptions": [
        "DCBs can be used without vessel preparation - FALSE, predilation improves outcomes",
        "All DCBs are equivalent - FALSE, significant variation in drug transfer and outcomes between devices",
        "DCBs eliminate restenosis completely - FALSE, reduce but don't eliminate restenosis",
        "DCBs are unsafe based on paclitaxel mortality signal - NUANCED, subsequent analyses show no significant mortality difference"
