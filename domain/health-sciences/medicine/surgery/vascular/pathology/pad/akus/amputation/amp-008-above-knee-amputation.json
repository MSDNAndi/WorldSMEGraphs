    "title": "Above-Knee Amputation (AKA): Transfemoral Amputation",
    "statement": {
      "text": "Above-knee amputation (AKA) is a major limb amputation at the transfemoral level that sacrifices the knee joint, reserved for patients where BKA is not possible or for non-ambulatory patients, with higher healing rates but lower functional outcomes.",
      "formal": "Level: 10-12 cm above knee joint; Healing rate: 90-95%; Prosthetic ambulation: 30-50% at 2 years; Energy expenditure: 60-100% above baseline"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "When the leg below the knee cannot be saved or the patient is unlikely to walk, amputating above the knee provides a higher chance of wound healing because of better blood supply at the thigh level.",
      "key_insight": "AKA sacrifices ambulation potential for healing reliability - it's a tradeoff that must be carefully considered for each patient.",
      "technical_details": "Above-knee amputation (transfemoral amputation) is performed through the distal third of the femur, typically 10-12 cm above the knee joint. A myodesis technique secures the adductor muscles to the femur to maintain functional muscle tension and hip stability. Equal anterior and posterior flaps or fish-mouth incision is used. AKA has high healing rates (90-95%) but significantly lower prosthetic ambulation success (30-50%) due to increased energy requirements.",
      "common_misconceptions": [
        "AKA is the default safe amputation - FALSE, should try BKA first when appropriate",
        "AKA patients can easily use prosthetics - FALSE, only 30-50% achieve prosthetic ambulation",
        "AKA has no functional consequence in non-ambulatory patients - FALSE, affects transfers and positioning",
