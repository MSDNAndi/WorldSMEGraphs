    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "When the great saphenous vein is not available (previous use, varicose, too small), the veins from the arm can be harvested and used as bypass conduit. Though slightly inferior to GSV, arm veins still outperform plastic grafts.",
      "key_insight": "Arm veins are the preferred secondary conduit after GSV. They are typically smaller (3-4mm) and may require splicing of multiple segments. Despite these limitations, 5-year patency for arm vein bypass exceeds prosthetic alternatives.",
      "technical_details": "Vein sources: cephalic (lateral arm, larger), basilic (medial arm). Mapping: preoperative ultrasound to assess diameter (>3mm preferred), continuity, and quality. Harvest: longitudinal incision, careful preservation of tributaries for potential splicing. Splicing: end-to-end anastomosis of multiple segments if single vein inadequate. Patency: 5-year primary patency 50-60% (vs 70% GSV, 30% prosthetic for below-knee)."
