    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "The pedal arteries form interconnected arches like a highway system for the foot - if one road is blocked, traffic can reroute through connecting loops. Complete arches allow collateral flow; incomplete arches leave areas vulnerable.",
      "key_insight": "Pedal arch patency is the ultimate determinant of revascularization success - a patent arch can compensate for single-vessel tibial disease.",
      "technical_details": "The pedal circulation consists of two interconnected arch systems: (1) The dorsal arch, formed by the dorsalis pedis artery giving the lateral tarsal and arcuate arteries, which supply the dorsal metatarsals; (2) The plantar arch, formed by the lateral plantar artery (from PT) connecting to the deep plantar artery (from DP). A complete pedal arch allows perfusion of all forefoot angiosomes from either AT/DP or PT. Arch assessment on angiography or duplex predicts runoff quality and healing potential.",
      "common_misconceptions": [
        "If DP pulse is absent, pedal arch is occluded - FALSE, may have retrograde filling from PT",
        "Complete arch assessment requires angiography - FALSE, duplex can assess",
