      "intuition": "PAD is primarily a marker of systemic atherosclerosis. While local limb symptoms may remain stable, the underlying disease process affects coronary and cerebral vessels, making cardiovascular death far more likely than limb loss.",

      "technical_details": "Population studies including the Edinburgh Artery Study and PARTNERS program demonstrate that among patients with intermittent claudication, symptom stability or improvement occurs in approximately 75% over 5 years. Only 1-3% annually progress to chronic limb-threatening ischemia (CLTI). However, 5-year mortality rates of 20-30% and cardiovascular event rates of 20% highlight the systemic nature of atherosclerotic disease.",
