    "definition": "Supervised exercise therapy (SET) is a structured program of walking exercises performed under medical supervision, typically for 30-45 minutes, three times per week for at least 12 weeks. It is recommended as first-line therapy for claudication and has been shown in trials to be as effective as or superior to revascularization for many patients.",
