    "statement": {
      "text": "Below-knee amputation (BKA) is a major limb amputation at the transtibial level that preserves the knee joint, enabling prosthetic rehabilitation and ambulation in appropriately selected patients.",
      "formal": "Level: 12-15 cm below tibial tuberosity; Healing rate: 80-90% with adequate perfusion; Prosthetic ambulation: 70-80% at 2 years; Mortality: 10-15% at 30 days (comorbid population)"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "When the foot cannot be saved, keeping the knee is the next best option. A preserved knee allows for a below-knee prosthesis which requires far less energy to walk with than an above-knee prosthesis.",
      "key_insight": "Preserving the knee joint dramatically improves prosthetic rehabilitation success - energy expenditure for walking is 40-60% higher with AKA than BKA.",
      "technical_details": "Below-knee amputation (transtibial amputation) is performed at the junction of the upper and middle thirds of the tibia, typically 12-15 cm below the tibial tuberosity. A long posterior myocutaneous flap provides durable soft tissue coverage. The tibia is beveled anteriorly to prevent skin breakdown. The fibula is cut 1-2 cm shorter than the tibia. Adequate perfusion assessment and patient selection are critical for healing success.",
      "common_misconceptions": [
        "AKA heals better than BKA - FALSE, similar healing rates with proper selection",
        "All CLTI patients should get AKA for reliability - FALSE, preserve the knee when possible",
        "BKA patients rarely walk - FALSE, 70-80% achieve prosthetic ambulation",
