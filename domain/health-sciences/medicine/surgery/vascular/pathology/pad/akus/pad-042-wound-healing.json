    "statement": {
      "text": "Wound healing prediction in PAD relies on perfusion assessment using ankle pressure, toe pressure, transcutaneous oxygen (TcPO2), or skin perfusion pressure (SPP), with specific thresholds predicting likelihood of healing with conservative management versus requiring revascularization.",
      "formal": "Healing_Probability ∝ Perfusion_Metrics (Toe_Pressure, TcPO2, SPP, ABI)"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Just as a fire needs oxygen to burn, wounds need blood flow to heal. By measuring how much oxygen reaches the skin around a wound, we can predict whether it will heal on its own or needs the 'fuel supply' improved through revascularization.",
      "key_insight": "Different perfusion metrics have established thresholds for healing: ankle pressure >70mmHg, toe pressure >30mmHg, TcPO2 >30mmHg, SPP >40mmHg generally predict healing. Values below these thresholds predict poor healing without revascularization.",
      "technical_details": "Ankle pressure: >70mmHg predicts healing; <50mmHg concerning. Toe pressure: >30mmHg favorable (>45mmHg excellent). TcPO2: >30mmHg generally heals, <20mmHg unlikely. SPP: >40mmHg heals, <30mmHg needs revascularization. Limitations: all metrics less reliable with calcified vessels (diabetics). Consider multiple modalities. Post-revascularization, recheck to confirm improved perfusion."
