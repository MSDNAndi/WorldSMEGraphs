    "statement": {

    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "When you only have a short piece of good vein, use it where it matters most - at the distal anastomosis below the knee. The prosthetic can handle the above-knee portion where it performs reasonably well, saving the precious vein for the critical distal segment.",
      "key_insight": "Prosthetic patency degrades dramatically below the knee. By using vein for only the distal segment, limited conduit is preserved for where autogenous tissue is essential. The sequential design also adds an intermediate outflow target.",
      "technical_details": "Configurations: (1) Fem-AK pop prosthetic with AK pop-tibial vein, (2) Fem-AK pop prosthetic with sequential vein jump to tibial. Sequential design: intermediate anastomosis at AK popliteal provides additional outflow, improving prosthetic segment patency. Vein placement: reversed or non-reversed for distal segment. Anastomosis: prosthetic-to-vein end-to-end with external reinforcement or spatulated end-to-side."
