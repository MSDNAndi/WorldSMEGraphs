      "text": "Excimer laser atherectomy uses ultraviolet light at 308nm wavelength to photoablate atherosclerotic plaque through photochemical, photothermal, and photomechanical mechanisms, particularly useful for in-stent restenosis and thrombotic occlusions.",
      "formal": "Excimer_Laser: UV_308nm → Photoablation → Plaque/Thrombus_Removal"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "The excimer laser vaporizes plaque and thrombus using precisely controlled pulses of ultraviolet light. It's like using a very focused beam to evaporate material without generating excessive heat that could damage surrounding tissue.",
      "key_insight": "Excimer laser has unique ability to ablate thrombus (other atherectomy devices cannot). This makes it valuable for thrombotic CTOs and in-stent restenosis where thrombus is often present within the neointima.",
      "technical_details": "Device: Spectranetics CVX-300. Wavelength: 308nm (ultraviolet). Mechanisms: photochemical (molecular bond disruption), photothermal (heat generation), photomechanical (vapor bubble formation). Catheter sizes: 0.9-2.5mm. Technique: advance 0.5-1mm/sec with saline flush during lasing. Key indications: in-stent restenosis, CTOs, thrombotic lesions. Fluence: 45-65 mJ/mm², frequency: 40-80 Hz."
