High-intensity regimens (atorvastatin 40-80mg, rosuvastatin 20-40mg) reduce LDL by >50% and provide pleiotropic effects: plaque stabilization, anti-inflammatory action, improved endothelial function, and reduced platelet aggregation. The Heart Protection Study demonstrated 22% reduction in major vascular events with statin therapy.
