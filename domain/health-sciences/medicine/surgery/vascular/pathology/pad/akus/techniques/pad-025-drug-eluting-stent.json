      "text": "Drug-eluting stents (DES) combine mechanical scaffolding with sustained antiproliferative drug release, providing improved patency compared to bare metal stents in femoropopliteal disease, particularly for longer lesions and bailout situations.",
      "formal": "Primary patency: 80-85% at 1 year, 70-75% at 2 years; Indications: Dissection, recoil, residual stenosis after balloon; Drug: Paclitaxel-coated polymer"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Sometimes balloon angioplasty isn't enough and a stent is needed to hold the artery open. Drug-eluting stents add an anti-scarring drug that slowly releases over weeks to months, reducing the body's tendency to form scar tissue inside the stent.",
      "key_insight": "DES represents a bailout strategy when primary balloon-only therapy fails - the goal is to avoid stenting when possible but use DES when necessary.",
      "technical_details": "Peripheral drug-eluting stents use paclitaxel in a polymer coating that provides sustained drug release over weeks. The Zilver PTX was the first FDA-approved peripheral DES and remains the primary device in this category. Self-expanding nitinol construction provides chronic outward force. Paclitaxel inhibits neointimal hyperplasia at the stent site. Long-term dual antiplatelet therapy is required to prevent stent thrombosis.",
      "common_misconceptions": [
        "DES should be first-line therapy - FALSE, DCB-first strategy preferred when possible",
