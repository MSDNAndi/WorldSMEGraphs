      "text": "Intravascular lithotripsy (IVL) uses sonic pressure waves to fracture intimal and medial calcium, enabling effective angioplasty and stent expansion in severely calcified peripheral arteries.",
      "formal": "Mechanism: Sonic pressure waves (1 atm) fracture calcium; Technique: Low-pressure balloon (4 atm) + lithotripsy pulses; Benefit: Enables vessel expansion while preserving soft tissue"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Heavy calcium in artery walls acts like armor, preventing balloons from stretching the vessel. Lithotripsy is like using sound waves to crack this armor from the inside, allowing the balloon to then expand the artery without damaging soft tissue.",
      "key_insight": "IVL selectively targets calcium while sparing soft tissue, enabling treatment of lesions previously considered unsuitable for endovascular therapy.",
      "technical_details": "Intravascular lithotripsy (Shockwave Medical) integrates lithotripsy emitters into an angioplasty balloon catheter. The balloon is inflated to 4 atm (low pressure) and then emitters deliver sonic pressure waves that propagate through the soft tissue (causing no damage) but fracture rigid calcium (both intimal and medial). Calcium microfractures allow the vessel to expand with subsequent angioplasty or stent deployment. This enables treatment of the 'undilatable' lesion.",
      "common_misconceptions": [
        "IVL damages soft tissue - FALSE, sonic waves pass through soft tissue harmlessly",
        "IVL is atherectomy - FALSE, no tissue removal, only calcium modification",
