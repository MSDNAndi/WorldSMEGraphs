      "text": "Tibial (infrapopliteal) disease involves the anterior tibial, posterior tibial, and peroneal arteries, is often diffuse and calcified especially in diabetics, and requires angiosome-based revascularization planning for CLTI with tissue loss.",
      "formal": "Three tibial arteries: AT → DP, PT → medial/lateral plantar, Peroneal → communicating branches; Diabetic pattern: Diffuse, calcified, spared proximal; Critical: Angiosome-targeted revascularization"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "The tibial arteries are the final common pathway to the foot. Disease here is the defining feature of critical limb ischemia, and diabetics are particularly affected with heavy calcification that spares the proximal vessels.",
      "key_insight": "Tibial disease drives critical limb ischemia - treatment must target the angiosome feeding the wound for optimal healing.",
      "technical_details": "The three tibial arteries arise from the popliteal trifurcation: anterior tibial (becomes dorsalis pedis), posterior tibial (gives medial and lateral plantar), and peroneal (provides collaterals via communicating branches). Diabetic arteriopathy preferentially affects tibial vessels with diffuse, calcified disease. The Global Limb Anatomic Staging System (GLASS) grades infrapopliteal disease based on target artery path and landing zone. Angiosome-directed revascularization improves wound healing outcomes.",
      "common_misconceptions": [
        "All three tibials need to be patent for foot viability - FALSE, single vessel runoff often sufficient",
