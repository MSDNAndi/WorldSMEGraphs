    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Traditional stents are like rigid tubes that can fracture when bent repeatedly. Interwoven stents are like a woven finger trap - they flex and compress with movement rather than breaking, making them ideal for areas that bend with walking.",
      "key_insight": "The interwoven design allows multi-directional flexibility while maintaining lumen patency. This is particularly advantageous in the popliteal artery which undergoes significant bending, compression, and torsion with knee flexion.",
      "technical_details": "Supera is the prototype interwoven nitinol stent. Design: 6-8 wires interlocked in helical pattern. Properties: high radial resistive force, low chronic outward force, flexibility in all planes, fracture-resistant. Indications: femoropopliteal disease especially crossing knee, in-stent restenosis, heavily calcified lesions. Sizing: typically 1:1 with reference vessel. Primary patency at 1 year: 80-85% in complex lesions."
