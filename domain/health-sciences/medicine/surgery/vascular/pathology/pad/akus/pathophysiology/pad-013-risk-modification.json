      "technical_details": "Risk factor modification in PAD includes five pillars: (1) Smoking cessation - the single most important intervention; (2) Lipid management - high-intensity statins for all PAD patients; (3) Antiplatelet therapy - aspirin or clopidogrel; (4) Blood pressure control - target <130/80; (5) Glycemic control in diabetics - HbA1c target individualized. These interventions collectively reduce cardiovascular events by 30-40% and improve limb outcomes.",
