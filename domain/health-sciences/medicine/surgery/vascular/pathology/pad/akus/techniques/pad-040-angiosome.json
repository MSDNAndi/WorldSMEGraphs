    "definition": "Angiosomes are three-dimensional blocks of tissue supplied by specific source arteries. In the foot, six angiosomes are defined: three from posterior tibial artery (medial calcaneal, medial plantar, lateral plantar), two from anterior tibial artery (anterior ankle, dorsal foot), and one from peroneal artery (lateral calcaneal). Direct revascularization targets the artery feeding the wound's angiosome.",
