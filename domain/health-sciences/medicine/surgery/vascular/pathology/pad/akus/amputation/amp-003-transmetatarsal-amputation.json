    "statement": {
      "text": "Transmetatarsal amputation removes the forefoot at the metatarsal level while preserving heel and midfoot function, requiring adequate plantar skin flap and perfusion for success.",
      "formal": "Level: Through metatarsal shafts (typically mid-metatarsal); Healing requirement: Ankle pressure >70 mmHg or ABI >0.50; Healing rate: 60-85% depending on perfusion; Function: Allows prosthetic-free ambulation"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "When forefoot gangrene is too extensive for toe amputation but the heel is viable, removing the front of the foot preserves the ability to walk with just a shoe filler - much better than losing the entire leg.",
      "key_insight": "TMA preserves the heel, which is the foundation of ambulation - patients can walk without a prosthesis using only a shoe filler.",
      "technical_details": "Transmetatarsal amputation transects all metatarsal bones at the mid-shaft level, preserving the tarsals and heel. A long plantar flap (from the ball of the foot) is essential for durable weight-bearing coverage. The incision is made in a fish-mouth pattern with a shorter dorsal and longer plantar component. Adequate perfusion (ankle pressure >70 mmHg, toe pressure >30 mmHg at ankle level) is necessary for healing. Equinus deformity is a common complication requiring Achilles lengthening.",
      "common_misconceptions": [
        "TMA patients need leg prosthesis - FALSE, can walk with shoe filler only",
        "TMA always heals if toes heal - FALSE, different perfusion requirements",
