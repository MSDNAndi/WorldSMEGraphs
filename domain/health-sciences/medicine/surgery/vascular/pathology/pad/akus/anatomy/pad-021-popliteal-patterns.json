      "text": "Popliteal artery disease occurs at mechanically stressed segments - the adductor canal and trifurcation - and determines bypass target selection, with disease extent classified as above-knee (P1), across-knee (P2), or below-knee (P3) segments.",

    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "The popliteal artery passes through a mechanically demanding region - compressed and flexed with every step. Disease concentrates at stress points, and understanding these patterns guides where to place bypass grafts or stents.",
      "key_insight": "A diseased popliteal artery may require targeting the tibial trifurcation or tibial vessels for bypass - always assess below the popliteal.",
      "technical_details": "The popliteal artery is divided into three segments: P1 (above-knee, from adductor hiatus to femoral condyles), P2 (at knee joint level), and P3 (below-knee, from knee joint to trifurcation). Atherosclerosis commonly affects the adductor canal (SFA-popliteal junction) and the trifurcation. Popliteal aneurysms are also common and can cause acute limb ischemia. Treatment planning must account for flexion stress and landing zone quality.",
