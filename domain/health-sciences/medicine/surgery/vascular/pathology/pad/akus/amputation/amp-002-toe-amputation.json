      "text": "Toe amputation is a minor amputation technique that can preserve foot function while removing necrotic or non-salvageable tissue, with success dependent on adequate perfusion and infection control.",
      "formal": "Types: Distal phalanx, MTP disarticulation, ray amputation; Perfusion requirement: TP >30mmHg, TcPO2 >30mmHg; Healing rate: 60-80% with adequate perfusion"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "When gangrene is limited to a toe, removing just that toe can stop the infection from spreading while preserving foot function. The key is ensuring enough blood flow exists to heal the surgical wound.",
      "key_insight": "The goal of toe amputation is to remove only what is necessary while maximizing remaining foot function - level selection is critical.",
      "technical_details": "Toe amputation encompasses several techniques: distal phalanx amputation (for tip necrosis), middle phalanx amputation, metatarsophalangeal (MTP) disarticulation, and ray amputation (toe plus metatarsal head). The choice depends on extent of gangrene, infection, and perfusion. Great toe amputation significantly impacts gait; preserving as much as possible is beneficial. Adequate perfusion (toe pressure >30 mmHg, TcPO2 >30 mmHg) predicts healing. Wound should be left open or loosely approximated if infection is present.",
      "common_misconceptions": [
        "All gangrenous toes need immediate amputation - FALSE, dry gangrene can autoamputate if infection controlled",
        "Toe amputation is always minor - FALSE, great toe amputation significantly affects gait",
