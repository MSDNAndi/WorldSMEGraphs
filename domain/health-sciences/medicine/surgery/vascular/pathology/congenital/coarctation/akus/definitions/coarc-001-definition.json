    "statement": {
      "text": "Coarctation of the aorta is a congenital narrowing of the aorta, typically at the isthmus (just distal to left subclavian artery origin, near the ligamentum arteriosum). It represents 5-8% of congenital heart disease and is associated with bicuspid aortic valve (50-75%), intracranial aneurysms, and other cardiac defects. Classic presentation is upper extremity hypertension with weak/delayed femoral pulses.",
      "formal": "Coarctation: Discrete aortic narrowing at isthmus (juxtaductal); Associations: BAV (50-75%), intracranial aneurysm, VSD, Turner syndrome; Presentation: upper extremity HTN, radial-femoral delay"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Coarctation is like a kink in the main garden hose coming from your house. The pressure builds up before the kink (upper body = high blood pressure) but is low after it (lower body = weak pulses). The body tries to compensate by growing extra blood vessels (collaterals) around the blockage, but the heart still works harder than it should pumping against the obstruction.",
      "key_insight": "Coarctation is not just an aortic problem - it's part of a generalized arteriopathy. Even after successful repair, patients remain at risk for hypertension, aortic aneurysm, and premature cardiovascular disease. Lifelong surveillance is required.",
      "technical_details": "Location is typically at the isthmus - the junction of aortic arch and descending aorta, where the ductus arteriosus inserted. Two theories: (1) ductal tissue extending into aortic wall constricts as ductus closes, (2) reduced fetal aortic flow from associated intracardiac defects leads to isthmus underdevelopment. Collaterals develop via internal mammary, intercostal, and scapular arteries (rib notching on CXR)."
