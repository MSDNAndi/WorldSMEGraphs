    "statement": {
      "text": "Trash foot (atheroembolism) results from cholesterol and plaque debris embolization to distal small vessels, causing painful digital ischemia with preserved proximal pulses, often iatrogenic from endovascular procedures.",

    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "When working on atherosclerotic arteries, pieces of plaque can break off and travel downstream, clogging tiny arteries in the toes. The toes turn blue and painful while the main pulses stay normal - because the blockage is in vessels too small to feel.",
      "key_insight": "Preserved pedal pulses with blue toes = think atheroembolism. The problem is in the microvasculature, not the large arteries.",
      "technical_details": "Atheroembolism (trash foot, cholesterol embolization syndrome) occurs when atherosclerotic debris dislodges from proximal aortic or arterial plaques and travels to small distal vessels. Unlike thromboembolism, these cholesterol crystals and calcific debris lodge in vessels <200 microns and cannot be removed. Triggers include endovascular procedures (catheter manipulation), vascular surgery, and anticoagulation (unmasking ulcerated plaques). Clinical features include painful blue toes, livedo reticularis, preserved proximal pulses, and renal or GI involvement in systemic cases. Prevention is paramount as treatment options are limited.",
      "common_misconceptions": [
