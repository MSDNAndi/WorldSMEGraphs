    "statement": {
      "text": "Post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS) is a chronic complication of deep venous thrombosis occurring in 20-50% of patients, characterized by persistent symptoms and signs of venous hypertension (pain, swelling, skin changes, ulceration) due to valve destruction, persistent obstruction, or both. Villalta score ≥5 diagnoses PTS; ≥15 or ulcer indicates severe PTS.",
      "formal": "PTS: Villalta_Score ≥5 = Diagnosis; ≥15 or Ulcer = Severe; Develops in 20-50% of proximal DVT"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "When a blood clot forms in a deep vein and then dissolves, it often damages the one-way valves in that vein and may leave scarring that narrows the vein. This is like a flood that damages both the drainage pipes and the check valves - even after the floodwaters recede, the plumbing never works quite right again.",
      "key_insight": "PTS is not just 'swelling after DVT' - it's a specific syndrome diagnosed by the Villalta score that includes both symptoms (pain, heaviness, cramping) and signs (edema, skin changes). Iliofemoral DVT has the highest PTS risk because it involves the largest veins with the most critical valves.",
      "technical_details": "PTS pathophysiology involves two components: reflux from valve destruction and obstruction from incomplete thrombus recanalization. The DVT triggers an inflammatory response that damages valve leaflets, while organized thrombus may leave residual stenosis. Either mechanism leads to ambulatory venous hypertension - venous pressure fails to drop with walking. The Villalta scale quantifies 5 symptoms (pain, cramps, heaviness, pruritus, paresthesia) and 6 signs (edema, skin induration, hyperpigmentation, venous ectasia, redness, pain with calf compression), each scored 0-3.",
      "common_misconceptions": [
        "Misconception: All leg swelling after DVT is PTS. Reality: Wait 3-6 months for acute changes to resolve before diagnosing PTS.",
        "Misconception: Compression stockings prevent PTS. Reality: The SOX trial showed compression stockings do NOT prevent PTS, though they help manage symptoms.",
        "Misconception: PTS is untreatable. Reality: Iliac stenting for obstruction is highly effective; valve surgery has limited role."
