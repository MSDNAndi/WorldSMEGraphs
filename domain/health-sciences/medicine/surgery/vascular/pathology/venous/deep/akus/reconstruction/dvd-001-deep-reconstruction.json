      "text": "Deep venous reconstruction encompasses endovascular and open surgical procedures to restore venous outflow (stenting, bypass) or valve competence (valvuloplasty, transplant) for severe post-thrombotic syndrome or primary deep venous insufficiency refractory to conservative therapy.",
      "formal": "Deep_Venous_Reconstruction = Outflow_Restoration (Stenting ∪ Bypass) ∪ Valve_Reconstruction (Valvuloplasty ∪ Transplant ∪ Neovalve)"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "When the deep venous highway is blocked or its one-way doors (valves) are destroyed, blood cannot efficiently return from the leg. Deep reconstruction either clears the blockage (stenting, bypass) or rebuilds the doors (valve surgery) to restore normal circulation.",
      "key_insight": "Endovascular stenting has revolutionized iliofemoral obstruction treatment, but valve reconstruction remains challenging with limited durability. The key is proper patient selection: stenting for obstruction, valve surgery only for isolated reflux without obstruction in select patients.",
      "technical_details": "Outflow reconstruction addresses chronic iliofemoral obstruction through dedicated venous stenting (14-24mm) or open bypass (Palma cross-femoral, May-Husni femoropopliteal). Valve reconstruction addresses isolated deep reflux through internal valvuloplasty (tightening redundant cusps), external valvuloplasty (cuff or sling), valve segment transplantation (brachial or axillary), or neovalve creation. Combined procedures address obstruction plus reflux.",
      "common_misconceptions": [
        "Misconception: Deep venous reconstruction is routinely performed. Reality: Most patients are managed with compression and superficial intervention; deep reconstruction is reserved for severe, refractory disease.",
        "Misconception: Valve transplant restores normal function. Reality: Transplanted valves have limited durability; 5-year competence is 50-60%.",
        "Misconception: Open bypass is obsolete. Reality: Palma procedure remains valuable for unilateral iliofemoral occlusion when stenting fails."
