      "text": "Superficial venous thrombophlebitis (SVT) is thrombosis and inflammation of a superficial vein, characterized by a painful erythematous palpable cord. Critical management decisions depend on proximity to the deep system: thrombus within 3-5cm of the SFJ or SPJ requires anticoagulation due to high DVT/PE risk, and 6-40% of SVT patients have concurrent DVT at presentation.",
      "formal": "SVT_Management: Proximity_to_SFJ < 3-5cm → Anticoagulation; DVT_Coexistence: 6-40%; PE_Risk if untreated near junction: 3-4%"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "SVT is like a small fire in a peripheral building - it's usually contained and self-limited. But if it's spreading toward the main building (deep venous system), you need to act aggressively to prevent it from becoming a much bigger problem. The closer to the SFJ, the greater the risk.",
      "key_insight": "The old teaching that 'superficial phlebitis is just phlebitis' is dangerous. SVT is a marker of hypercoagulability and often occurs with concurrent DVT. ALWAYS ultrasound to check for DVT and assess proximity to deep system. Treatment escalates dramatically based on location.",
      "technical_details": "SVT affects 3-11% of the population, usually in association with varicose veins (60-80%). The CALISTO trial showed fondaparinux 2.5mg daily for 45 days reduces DVT/PE risk by 85% in SVT patients. Anticoagulation is indicated when thrombus is within 3-5cm of the SFJ or SPJ, when thrombus is >5cm long, or when there's no obvious provocation (suggesting hypercoagulability). The SURPRISE trial confirmed that rivaroxaban 10mg is also effective for high-risk SVT.",
      "common_misconceptions": [
        "Misconception: SVT is a benign condition needing only local care. Reality: 6-40% have concurrent DVT; 3-4% progress to PE if near junction.",
        "Misconception: Clinical exam is sufficient for SVT diagnosis. Reality: Ultrasound is mandatory to assess extent and exclude DVT.",
        "Misconception: Antibiotics are needed for SVT. Reality: Unless septic, SVT is inflammatory not infectious - use NSAIDs, not antibiotics."
