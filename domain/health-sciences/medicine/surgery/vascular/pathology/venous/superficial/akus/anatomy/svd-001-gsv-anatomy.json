      "text": "The great saphenous vein (GSV) is the longest vein in the body, originating from the medial marginal vein, ascending in the saphenous compartment along the medial leg and thigh, and terminating at the saphenofemoral junction. Its consistent anatomic course makes it ideal for endovenous treatment and bypass conduit harvesting.",
      "formal": "GSV: Medial_Malleolus → Saphenous_Compartment (medial_calf → medial_thigh) → SFJ at CFV"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "The GSV is like a main highway running up the inside of your leg within a protective tunnel (saphenous compartment). Understanding this highway's route, exits (tributaries and perforators), and the protective tunnel it travels in is essential for treating varicose veins.",
      "key_insight": "The 'saphenous eye' on ultrasound is the key to identifying the true GSV - a hyperechoic saphenous fascia above the vein and deep fascia below creates an eye-shaped pattern. This confirms you're in the GSV and not a tributary, which is critical for treatment success.",
      "technical_details": "The GSV originates from the dorsal venous arch, anterior to the medial malleolus. It ascends in the superficial tissue in the lower leg, then enters the saphenous compartment bounded by the saphenous fascia superficially and muscular fascia deeply. In the thigh, it lies posteromedially, curving anteriorly at the SFJ. Major tributaries include the anterior and posterior arch veins of the leg, and the accessory saphenous veins (anterior and posterior) in the thigh. The saphenous nerve accompanies the GSV below the knee, making stripping in this region risky.",
      "common_misconceptions": [
        "Misconception: The GSV lies directly under the skin throughout. Reality: The GSV is in the saphenous compartment, separated from skin by the saphenous fascia.",
        "Misconception: The GSV follows a straight course. Reality: The GSV curves at the knee and can have duplications or anatomic variants.",
        "Misconception: All visible varicose veins are GSV. Reality: Visible veins are often tributaries; the true GSV is deeper in the saphenous compartment."
