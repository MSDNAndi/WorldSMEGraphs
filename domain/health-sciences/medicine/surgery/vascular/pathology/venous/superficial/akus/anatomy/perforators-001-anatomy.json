      "text": "Perforator veins are vessels connecting the superficial to deep venous systems by traversing the deep fascia, containing valves directing flow deep. Incompetent perforators (>3.5mm diameter with outward flow >0.5 seconds) transmit deep venous pressure to the skin, causing localized venous hypertension, skin changes, and ulceration.",

    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Perforator veins are like controlled pressure valves connecting a high-pressure underground pipe (deep veins) to a low-pressure surface system (superficial veins). When the valve fails, high pressure blasts through to the surface, damaging everything in its path - the skin.",
      "key_insight": "The Cockett perforators (medial lower leg) are the most clinically important because they underlie the 'gaiter zone' where venous ulcers typically occur. A patient with a non-healing medial ankle ulcer likely has incompetent Cockett perforators that must be addressed for healing.",
      "technical_details": "Perforators are classified as direct (connecting superficial directly to deep axial veins) or indirect (passing through muscle before reaching deep veins). They contain 1-3 bicuspid valves normally directing flow from superficial to deep. Named perforators are located in predictable positions: Cockett I, II, III in the medial lower leg (6-7cm, 13-14cm, 18-20cm from sole); Boyd at below-knee level; Sherman at mid-calf; Dodd in the distal thigh; and Hunterian at mid-thigh. The medial leg has the most clinically significant perforators.",
      "common_misconceptions": [
        "Misconception: All perforators need treatment. Reality: Only 'pathologic' perforators (>3.5mm, >0.5sec outward flow, symptomatic location) warrant intervention.",
        "Misconception: Perforator treatment alone heals ulcers. Reality: Superficial and deep disease must be addressed first; perforators are adjunctive.",
        "Misconception: Perforators always connect GSV to deep veins. Reality: Many perforators connect tributaries or independent varicose veins to deep veins."
