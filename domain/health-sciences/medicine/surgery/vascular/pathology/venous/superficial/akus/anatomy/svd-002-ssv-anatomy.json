    "statement": {
      "text": "The small saphenous vein (SSV) originates from the lateral marginal vein of the foot, ascends the posterior calf in the saphenous compartment, and terminates at the highly variable saphenopopliteal junction (SPJ), with critical proximity to the sural nerve requiring careful preoperative mapping for all SSV interventions.",
      "formal": "SSV: Lateral_Malleolus → Posterior_Calf → SPJ (variable: popliteal fossa to mid-thigh) OR Giacomini_Vein → GSV"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "While the GSV is the main highway on the inside of the leg, the SSV is a smaller highway on the back of the calf. Unlike the predictable GSV, the SSV's endpoint (SPJ) is highly variable - it can join the deep system anywhere from behind the knee to the thigh, or connect to the GSV instead.",
      "key_insight": "The SPJ location varies so much that 'standard' surgical landmarks are unreliable. Ultrasound mapping is mandatory before any SSV intervention. Additionally, the sural nerve runs with the SSV below mid-calf, making thermal injury a significant risk - always use tumescent anesthesia for thermal ablation.",
      "technical_details": "The SSV originates posterior to the lateral malleolus from the lateral marginal vein. It ascends superficially in the lower calf, entering the saphenous compartment between the two heads of the gastrocnemius at mid-calf. The SSV lies in the posterior compartment bounded by the crural fascia superficially and deep fascia posteriorly. The SPJ location varies widely: it may enter the popliteal vein (classic), extend cranially as the Giacomini vein to join the GSV in the thigh, or drain into gastrocnemius veins. The sural nerve (medial and lateral components) runs closely with the SSV, converging below mid-calf.",
      "common_misconceptions": [
        "Misconception: The SPJ is always at the popliteal crease. Reality: SPJ height is highly variable; it may be absent in 10-20% of patients.",
        "Misconception: SSV treatment is similar to GSV. Reality: Prone positioning, variable SPJ, and sural nerve risk make SSV treatment distinct.",
        "Misconception: Thermal injury to the sural nerve is rare. Reality: Without tumescent anesthesia, thermal nerve injury occurs in up to 10% of cases."
