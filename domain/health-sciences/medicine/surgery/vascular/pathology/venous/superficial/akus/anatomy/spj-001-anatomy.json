      "text": "The saphenopopliteal junction (SPJ) is the highly variable termination point of the small saphenous vein (SSV), classically into the popliteal vein but absent in 20-30% of limbs where the SSV drains via the Giacomini vein to the GSV instead. Preoperative ultrasound mapping of SPJ location is mandatory.",
      "formal": "SPJ_Location: Popliteal_Fossa, 3-7cm above knee crease (variable); Present in 70-80%, Absent in 20-30% (Giacomini drainage)"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "If the GSV termination (SFJ) is like a predictable highway interchange, the SPJ is more like a country road junction that might be in a different place in every county. You cannot assume where it is - you must map it with ultrasound before any procedure.",
      "key_insight": "The key clinical implication of SPJ variability is that preoperative ultrasound mapping is MANDATORY. Unlike the SFJ which is consistently 2-4cm below the inguinal ligament, the SPJ can be at knee level, mid-thigh, or completely absent (Giacomini drainage). Treating the SSV without knowing where it terminates risks incomplete treatment or injury to popliteal structures.",
      "technical_details": "The SPJ classically forms where the SSV enters the posterolateral aspect of the popliteal vein in the popliteal fossa. The terminal valve lies within 1-2cm of the junction. The Giacomini vein, when present, is a cranial extension of the SSV that courses posteromedially in the thigh to join the GSV. In 20-30% of limbs, this is the primary SSV drainage (no true SPJ). Variations include termination into gastrocnemius veins, femoral vein, or profunda femoris vein.",
      "common_misconceptions": [
        "Misconception: The SPJ is always at the popliteal crease. Reality: SPJ height varies from the crease to mid-thigh; it may be absent entirely.",
        "Misconception: SSV treatment is similar to GSV. Reality: SPJ variability and sural nerve proximity make SSV treatment more complex.",
        "Misconception: If no SPJ is found, the SSV doesn't need treatment. Reality: Giacomini drainage is an alternative; treat the Giacomini if refluxing."
