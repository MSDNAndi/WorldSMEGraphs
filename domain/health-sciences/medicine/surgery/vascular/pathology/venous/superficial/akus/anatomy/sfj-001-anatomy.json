      "text": "The saphenofemoral junction (SFJ) is the anatomic confluence where the great saphenous vein terminates in the common femoral vein, characterized by the terminal valve, multiple named tributaries ('crosse'), and consistent relationships to the femoral artery and inguinal ligament essential for surgical and endovenous procedures.",
      "formal": "SFJ_Location: 2-4cm inferior to inguinal ligament, 3-4cm inferolateral to pubic tubercle, medial to femoral artery"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "The SFJ is like a major highway interchange where the main surface road (GSV) joins the deep underground highway (CFV). At this junction, there's a critical one-way gate (terminal valve) and several smaller roads (tributaries) that all converge, making it a complex surgical landmark.",
      "key_insight": "The terminal valve at the SFJ is the 'first line of defense' against reflux. When it fails, blood regurgitates into the GSV with each heartbeat, driving the development of varicose veins. Understanding SFJ anatomy is essential because inadequate surgical treatment of tributaries leads to recurrence.",
      "technical_details": "The SFJ lies in the femoral triangle, covered by the cribriform fascia which contains the saphenous hiatus. The GSV courses anteromedially in the thigh and curves laterally at the SFJ to enter the anteriomedial aspect of the CFV. The terminal valve lies within 1-2cm of the junction. The preterminal valve lies 2-4cm distally. Major tributaries form the 'crosse': superficial inferior epigastric (superiorly), superficial circumflex iliac (laterally), external pudendal veins (medially), plus anterolateral and posterolateral thigh veins.",
      "common_misconceptions": [
        "Misconception: The SFJ is at the groin crease. Reality: The SFJ is 2-4cm below the inguinal ligament; the groin crease is unreliable.",
        "Misconception: All SFJ tributaries are similar. Reality: Significant anatomic variation exists; always map with ultrasound.",
        "Misconception: Treating the GSV trunk alone is sufficient. Reality: Incompetent tributaries (especially anterior accessory) can be independent reflux sources."
