    "statement": {
      "text": "Chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) is a syndrome of ambulatory venous hypertension from impaired venous return, caused by valvular incompetence (reflux) and/or venous obstruction. It manifests as varicose veins, edema, skin changes (hyperpigmentation, lipodermatosclerosis), and venous ulceration. The CEAP classification provides standardized description.",
      "formal": "CVI: Ambulatory venous hypertension from reflux ± obstruction; Spectrum: varicose veins → edema → skin changes → ulcer; CEAP classification: Clinical-Etiologic-Anatomic-Pathophysiologic"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Veins have one-way valves that keep blood flowing toward the heart, against gravity when standing. When these valves fail (from genetics, prior clot, or just wear and tear), blood falls back down and pools in the legs. Over time, this backward flow and pooling damages the smallest blood vessels, causing fluid to leak into tissues and chronic inflammation that leads to skin damage and eventually ulcers.",
      "key_insight": "CVI is extremely common, affecting up to 50% of adults to some degree. While often considered cosmetic (varicose veins), advanced CVI causes significant morbidity and affects quality of life. Venous ulcers heal slowly and frequently recur without addressing the underlying venous hypertension.",
      "technical_details": "Venous hypertension in CVI typically >80 mmHg (normal ambulatory venous pressure 20-30 mmHg with calf muscle pump). Superficial reflux (saphenous) is most common and most treatable. Deep vein reflux and obstruction (post-thrombotic) are harder to treat. Perforator vein incompetence transmits high deep system pressures to superficial system."
