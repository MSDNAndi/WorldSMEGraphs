      "text": "Varicose veins are dilated, tortuous superficial veins >3mm in diameter resulting from venous valvular incompetence and venous hypertension, affecting 20-25% of women and 10-15% of men, most commonly involving the great and small saphenous systems. Treatment has shifted from surgical stripping to endovenous ablation techniques.",
      "formal": "Varicose_Veins: Diameter > 3mm + Reflux > 0.5 seconds; Prevalence: 20-25% women, 10-15% men; Treatment: Endovenous_Ablation (first-line)"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Varicose veins are like pipes that have stretched and lost their one-way check valves. Without functioning valves, blood that should only flow toward the heart sloshes backward with every heartbeat, making the pipes bulge even more. It's a vicious cycle of more dilation leading to more valve failure.",
      "key_insight": "The key to treating varicose veins is understanding that the visible varicosities are usually tributaries - the underlying problem is reflux in the axial vein (GSV or SSV). Treating only the visible varicosities without addressing the source of reflux leads to recurrence. Always map with duplex ultrasound before treatment.",
      "technical_details": "Varicose veins result from primary valve failure (degenerative, genetic, hormonal) or secondary valve destruction (post-thrombotic). The terminal valve at the SFJ is often the first to fail, allowing reflux that propagates distally. Valve failure leads to sustained ambulatory venous hypertension, which dilates veins further, causing more valve failure. CEAP C2 disease (varicose veins) has prevalence of 25-30% in Western populations. Treatment has evolved from stripping to endovenous thermal ablation (laser, RFA) with >95% occlusion rates and lower recurrence than surgery.",
      "common_misconceptions": [
        "Misconception: Varicose veins are purely cosmetic. Reality: Untreated varicose veins can progress to skin changes and ulceration (C4-C6).",
        "Misconception: Visible varicosities are the problem. Reality: They are tributaries; the axial reflux (GSV/SSV) is the root cause.",
        "Misconception: Surgery is the best treatment. Reality: Endovenous ablation is now first-line with better outcomes than stripping."
