    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "When the major deep veins are blocked or their valves don't work, surgery can either bypass the blockage, fix the valves, or transplant working valves from elsewhere - essentially plumbing repairs to restore proper drainage.",
      "key_insight": "Deep venous reconstruction is reserved for patients with severe post-thrombotic syndrome or chronic obstruction not responding to compression. Patient selection is critical - these are complex procedures with variable results.",
      "technical_details": "Procedures: (1) Palma procedure: GSV crossover bypass for unilateral iliac occlusion, (2) Valve repair: external valvuloplasty, internal valvuloplasty, (3) Valve transplant: axillary valve segment to femoral vein, (4) Neovalve: autogenous tissue reconstruction, (5) Endovascular: IVUS-guided iliofemoral stenting. Patient selection: severe PTS (Villalta >15), failed conservative therapy, confirmed obstruction on imaging."
