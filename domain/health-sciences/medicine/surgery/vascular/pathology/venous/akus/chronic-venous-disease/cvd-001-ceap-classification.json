      "intuition": "CEAP provides a comprehensive, reproducible language for describing venous disease severity, cause, location, and mechanism, enabling standardized communication between clinicians and comparison across studies.",

      "technical_details": "The revised CEAP classification (2020) added modifiers for recurrent disease (r) and includes 18 anatomic segments. The basic CEAP uses highest C class plus descriptor, while advanced CEAP includes all components. Corona phlebectatica (ankle flare) was added as C4c. Each limb is classified independently.",
      "common_misconceptions": [
        "Misconception: Higher C class always indicates more severe disease. Reality: C class describes the highest manifestation present, but a C3 (edema) patient may have worse symptoms than a C4 patient.",
        "Misconception: CEAP measures symptoms. Reality: CEAP is purely objective; VCSS measures symptoms and severity.",
        "Misconception: C6 is permanent. Reality: Healed ulcers become C5, and can recur to C6 (C6,r)."
