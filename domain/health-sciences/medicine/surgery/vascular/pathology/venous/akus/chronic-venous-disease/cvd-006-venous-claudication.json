      "text": "Venous claudication is exercise-induced lower extremity pain caused by severe venous outflow obstruction (typically iliofemoral), where increased arterial inflow during exercise cannot be accommodated by venous drainage, causing bursting leg pain and cyanosis.",
      "formal": "Venous_Claudication = Exercise_Arterial_Inflow > Obstructed_Venous_Outflow → Compartment_Hypertension + Venous_Engorgement"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Imagine a highway with an entrance ramp wide open but the exit blocked. During rest, traffic (blood) flows slowly and can trickle through. During exercise, traffic surges but cannot exit, causing a backup (engorgement) and pressure buildup (compartment hypertension), resulting in a bursting, aching leg pain.",
      "key_insight": "Venous claudication differs fundamentally from arterial claudication: it develops with continued walking (not relieved by stopping), causes bursting (not cramping) pain, and requires elevation (not just rest) for relief. Recognition prevents inappropriate arterial workup and guides venous intervention.",
      "technical_details": "Venous claudication occurs with severe iliofemoral occlusion, typically from extensive post-thrombotic syndrome or May-Thurner compression with chronic thrombosis. During exercise, arterial inflow increases 10-20 fold, but obstructed venous outflow cannot accommodate this volume. Venous pressure rises dramatically (to 100-150 mmHg), muscle compartments become engorged, and ischemic metabolites accumulate. The calf pump, rather than helping, worsens symptoms by pushing blood into an obstructed outflow tract.",
      "common_misconceptions": [
        "Misconception: Venous claudication improves with rest like arterial claudication. Reality: Venous claudication requires elevation; standing rest may not relieve symptoms.",
        "Misconception: Venous claudication is cramping pain. Reality: It is described as bursting, aching, or heaviness, not cramping.",
        "Misconception: Normal arterial studies rule out claudication. Reality: Venous claudication causes exercise-induced leg pain with normal arterial studies."
