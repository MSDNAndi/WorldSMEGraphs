    "statement": {
      "text": "Venous hypertension is the sustained elevation of ambulatory venous pressure (>40 mmHg) that drives the pathophysiological cascade of chronic venous disease, leading to inflammation, skin changes, and ultimately venous ulceration.",
      "formal": "Ambulatory_Venous_Hypertension: AVP > 40 mmHg during walking (normal: 20-30 mmHg)"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "When venous pressure remains elevated during walking, blood pools in the leg, stretching vessel walls, causing fluid leakage into tissues, and triggering an inflammatory cascade that damages skin and subcutaneous tissue over time.",
      "key_insight": "The severity of skin changes and ulceration risk correlates directly with the degree of ambulatory venous hypertension. Patients with AVP >80 mmHg have near-certain ulceration, while those with AVP <30 mmHg rarely develop skin changes.",
      "technical_details": "Venous hypertension causes capillary distension, widening of endothelial gaps, and extravasation of macromolecules including fibrinogen. Pericapillary fibrin cuffs impair oxygen diffusion. Leukocyte trapping in distended capillaries leads to activation and release of proteolytic enzymes and reactive oxygen species. This creates a chronic inflammatory state with tissue remodeling, liposclerosis, and ultimately ulceration.",
      "common_misconceptions": [
        "Misconception: Venous ulcers result from tissue ischemia similar to arterial disease. Reality: The mechanism is inflammatory, not ischemic, though oxygen diffusion is impaired.",
        "Misconception: Superficial reflux alone causes severe venous hypertension. Reality: Combined superficial and deep disease causes the highest pressures.",
        "Misconception: All patients with reflux develop venous hypertension. Reality: Adequate collateral drainage and muscle pump function can compensate for reflux."
