    "statement": {
      "text": "Foam sclerotherapy is a minimally invasive treatment for varicose veins using detergent sclerosants (polidocanol, STS) mixed with gas to create foam, which displaces blood and damages the vein endothelium, causing thrombosis and fibrosis. It is effective for truncal veins, tributaries, perforators, and residual/recurrent varicosities.",
      "formal": "Foam_Sclerotherapy: Sclerosant + Gas (1:4 ratio) → Tessari_Method → Endothelial_Damage → Thrombosis → Fibrosis → Vein_Occlusion"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Foam sclerotherapy works like injecting soapy foam into a vein. The foam pushes blood out of the way and coats the vein wall, causing direct damage to the lining cells. The vein then clots, scars, and eventually disappears.",
      "key_insight": "Foam is 4x more potent than liquid sclerosant because it displaces blood (which dilutes liquid) and maintains prolonged contact with the vein wall. This allows treatment of larger veins with lower concentrations, but requires careful technique to avoid complications like DVT, visual disturbances, and skin necrosis.",
      "technical_details": "Foam is prepared using the Tessari method: 1 part liquid sclerosant mixed with 4 parts gas (room air or CO2) through a three-way stopcock between two syringes, passed back and forth 20 times to create uniform microbubbles. Common agents are polidocanol (0.5-3%) and sodium tetradecyl sulfate (0.5-3%). Maximum foam volume per session is typically 10-15mL. Ultrasound guidance ensures accurate placement and allows real-time monitoring for deep vein extension.",
      "common_misconceptions": [
        "Misconception: Foam sclerotherapy is only for spider veins. Reality: Foam effectively treats truncal veins up to 10mm, tributaries, and perforators.",
        "Misconception: Foam is safer than thermal ablation. Reality: Foam has specific risks (visual disturbance, DVT, skin necrosis) not seen with thermal techniques.",
        "Misconception: One session is sufficient. Reality: Most patients require 2-3 sessions for optimal results; recurrence rates are higher than thermal ablation."
