    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Instead of one long incision to strip out a vein, phlebectomy uses many tiny pokes (like keyhole surgery) to pull out segments of varicose veins through small holes that heal without stitches and leave minimal scars.",
      "key_insight": "Phlebectomy provides immediate removal of bulging varicose veins with excellent cosmesis. It is typically combined with truncal ablation (thermal or chemical) to treat both the source of reflux and the visible varicosities.",
      "technical_details": "Technique: mark veins standing, tumescent anesthesia, 2-3mm incisions with 11-blade or needle, extract vein with Müller hooks. Incisions: no sutures, Steri-strips or left open. Timing: often same day as truncal ablation. Complications: hematoma, hyperpigmentation, nerve injury, incomplete removal. Alternatives: sclerotherapy for smaller veins. Contraindications: active cellulitis, severe lymphedema, anticoagulation (relative)."
