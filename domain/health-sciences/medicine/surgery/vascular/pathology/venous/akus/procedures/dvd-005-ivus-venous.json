      "text": "Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) is the gold standard for evaluating iliofemoral venous obstruction, providing real-time cross-sectional imaging that quantifies stenosis severity, identifies wall abnormalities, and guides stent sizing and placement with superior accuracy compared to venography.",
      "formal": "IVUS_Venous: Cross-Sectional_Area_Measurement → Stenosis_Quantification > Venography (30-50% more accurate)"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "IVUS is like putting a tiny ultrasound camera inside the vein to look at the walls from the inside. While venography shows a silhouette (like a shadow on a wall), IVUS shows the actual structure of the vein wall and any compression, webs, or damage.",
      "key_insight": "Venography consistently underestimates iliac vein stenosis by 30-50% because external compression flattens the vein without narrowing its length. IVUS directly measures cross-sectional area, which is the true determinant of hemodynamic significance. A stenosis appearing as 50% on venography may be 80% by area on IVUS.",
      "technical_details": "IVUS catheters (8-10 French) use either mechanical rotating transducers (20-40 MHz) or phased array technology to generate 360-degree cross-sectional images. The catheter is advanced beyond the area of interest and slowly withdrawn during imaging. Key measurements include cross-sectional area (CSA), minimum and maximum diameters, and comparison to normal reference segments. Findings include external compression, intimal hyperplasia, webs, synechiae, and chronic thrombus.",
      "common_misconceptions": [
        "Misconception: Venography is sufficient for treatment planning. Reality: IVUS changes treatment decisions in 20-40% of cases by revealing stenosis severity missed on venography.",
        "Misconception: IVUS is only for complex cases. Reality: IVUS should be routine for any iliofemoral intervention given its superior accuracy.",
        "Misconception: Area stenosis correlates linearly with hemodynamic impact. Reality: >50% area stenosis is the threshold for hemodynamic significance."
