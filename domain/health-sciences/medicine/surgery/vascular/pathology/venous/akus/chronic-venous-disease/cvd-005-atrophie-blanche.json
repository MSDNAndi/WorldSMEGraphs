    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Atrophie blanche represents the end-stage of localized skin infarction from small vessel disease. The white color reflects dermal fibrosis without melanin, while the surrounding pigmentation shows hemosiderin from prior extravasation. These are the scars of previous microvascular events.",
      "key_insight": "Atrophie blanche indicates significant microangiopathy and high ulceration risk. While classically associated with venous disease, it can occur in other conditions with small vessel thrombosis (livedoid vasculopathy, antiphospholipid syndrome), requiring careful evaluation of underlying etiology.",
      "technical_details": "Histologically, atrophie blanche shows dermal sclerosis, loss of appendages, hyalinized thickened capillary walls, and fibrin deposition in vessel lumens. The pathophysiology involves endothelial damage from venous hypertension, platelet activation, fibrin deposition, and small vessel thrombosis leading to localized tissue infarction and subsequent atrophic scarring.",
      "common_misconceptions": [
        "Misconception: Atrophie blanche is a healed venous ulcer. Reality: It results from dermal infarction, not ulcer healing; healed ulcers have different morphology.",
        "Misconception: All atrophie blanche is from venous disease. Reality: Livedoid vasculopathy (primary small vessel disease) can cause identical lesions.",
        "Misconception: Atrophie blanche is cosmetic only. Reality: It indicates significant microangiopathy and high risk of future ulceration."
