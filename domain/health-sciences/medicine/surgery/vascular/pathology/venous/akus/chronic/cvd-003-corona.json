      "text": "Corona phlebectatica is a fan-shaped pattern of small intradermal veins at the medial or lateral ankle, representing an early clinical sign of chronic venous insufficiency that correlates with venous reflux on duplex.",

    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "These are tiny blood vessels that form a distinctive fan or spray pattern around the ankle - like a small red/blue sunburst. They appear because the pressure from venous reflux backs up into the smallest vessels near the ankle bone.",
      "key_insight": "Corona phlebectatica is a highly specific sign of underlying venous reflux, present in 80-90% of patients with documented reflux. It often appears before more obvious signs of CVI and should prompt duplex evaluation.",
      "technical_details": "Location: medial or lateral malleolar region. Pattern: fan-shaped or parallel intradermal vessels. CEAP classification: C1 (telangiectasia). Clinical significance: indicates underlying reflux in 80-90% of cases, predicts progression to more severe CVI. Associated with: GSV reflux, perforator incompetence. Differential: spider veins without reflux (usually more scattered pattern)."
