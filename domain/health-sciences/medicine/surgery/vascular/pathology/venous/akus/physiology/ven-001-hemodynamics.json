    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Think of the venous system as a large reservoir with many one-way doors (valves) that holds 70% of your blood. Getting this blood back uphill to the heart requires coordinated pumping (breathing and walking) and properly functioning doors that only open in one direction.",
      "key_insight": "The venous system is fundamentally different from arteries: it operates at 1/10th the pressure but holds 7x more blood. Standing still, ankle venous pressure reaches 90 mmHg - walking with competent valves drops it to 20-30 mmHg. This pressure drop is the key marker of venous health.",
      "technical_details": "The venous system operates at 5-10 mmHg central pressure versus 80-100 mmHg arterial. Capacitance (70% blood volume) provides reserve for cardiac preload adjustment. Transmural pressure in the leg depends on hydrostatic column height, which valves segment into shorter columns. Return mechanisms include respiratory pump (inspiration creates negative intrathoracic pressure pulling blood centrally), calf muscle pump (generates 200-300 mmHg propelling blood against gravity), arterial pulsation vis-a-tergo, and cardiac suction (atrial relaxation). Venous flow is phasic with respiration in proximal veins.",
      "common_misconceptions": [
        "Misconception: The heart pushes blood through veins. Reality: The heart provides minimal vis-a-tergo pressure in veins; respiratory and muscle pumps are the primary drivers.",
        "Misconception: Venous pressure is constant. Reality: Venous pressure varies dramatically with position and activity - 90 mmHg standing, 20 mmHg walking.",
        "Misconception: Veins are passive conduits. Reality: Veins actively regulate capacitance through smooth muscle tone and valvular function."
