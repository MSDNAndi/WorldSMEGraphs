    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Just like stenting a blocked artery, you can stent a blocked vein to open it up. The iliac veins (in the pelvis) are commonly affected by either external compression or old blood clots, and stents can restore normal drainage.",
      "key_insight": "IVUS (intravascular ultrasound) is essential for venous stenting - it reveals obstruction not visible on venography. Dedicated venous stents are preferred over arterial stents due to different radial force and flexibility requirements.",
      "technical_details": "Indications: May-Thurner syndrome, post-thrombotic iliofemoral obstruction, chronic venous insufficiency with outflow obstruction. Technique: femoral or popliteal access, IVUS to assess stenosis (>50% reduction), dedicated venous stent sized to vessel diameter. Stent types: Wallstent, VICI, Venovo, Abre (venous-specific). IVUS criteria: >50% area reduction is significant. Patency: 1-year 80-90% for non-thrombotic, 70-80% for post-thrombotic. Anticoagulation: typically 3-6 months post-stent."
