      "text": "GSV ablation techniques (thermal: RFA, EVLA; non-thermal: cyanoacrylate glue, MOCA) have replaced stripping as first-line treatment for GSV reflux, with equivalent long-term efficacy (>90% closure at 5 years), faster recovery, and distinct advantages for specific clinical scenarios.",
      "formal": "GSV_Ablation_Success: Thermal (RFA/EVLA) ≈ Non-Thermal (Glue/MOCA) ≈ 93-97% at 1 year; >90% at 5 years"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Instead of surgically removing the GSV (stripping), modern ablation techniques destroy the vein in place using heat, glue, or mechanical/chemical injury. The body then absorbs the treated vein over weeks to months, achieving the same goal with less trauma and faster recovery.",
      "key_insight": "Choosing between ablation techniques depends on patient anatomy (vein size, tortuosity), clinical context (anesthesia tolerance, cost), and provider experience. Non-thermal techniques avoid tumescent anesthesia and reduce nerve injury risk, making them attractive for above-knee GSV treatment.",
      "technical_details": "Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) uses segmental heating to 120°C via a catheter, treating 7cm segments over 20 seconds. Endovenous laser ablation (EVLA) uses continuous wavelength-specific energy (810-1470nm) causing irreversible vein wall damage. Cyanoacrylate adhesive (VenaSeal) polymerizes within the vein, causing occlusion and fibrosis. Mechanochemical ablation (MOCA/ClariVein) combines rotating wire endothelial injury with liquid sclerosant. All require ultrasound guidance and proper catheter positioning 2-5cm from the SFJ.",
      "common_misconceptions": [
        "Misconception: Thermal ablation is superior to non-thermal. Reality: Both have equivalent 5-year efficacy; choice depends on clinical factors.",
        "Misconception: Tumescent anesthesia is always required. Reality: Non-thermal techniques (glue, MOCA) avoid tumescent anesthesia entirely.",
        "Misconception: Large veins require surgery. Reality: Thermal ablation can treat veins up to 25mm with appropriate technique."
