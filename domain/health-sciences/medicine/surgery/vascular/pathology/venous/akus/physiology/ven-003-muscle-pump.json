    "statement": {
      "text": "The venous muscle pump system, particularly the calf muscle pump, is the primary mechanism driving venous return from the lower extremities against gravity, functioning as a 'peripheral heart' that reduces ambulatory venous pressure by 50-70%.",
      "formal": "Muscle_Pump_Efficiency = (Standing_Pressure - Ambulatory_Pressure) / Standing_Pressure × 100%"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "The calf muscles act like a pump by compressing deep veins during walking, propelling blood toward the heart. Competent valves prevent backflow between contractions, allowing progressive emptying of the leg veins.",
      "key_insight": "The calf muscle pump generates pressures up to 200-300 mmHg during contraction, sufficient to overcome gravitational resistance. Pump failure from immobility, obesity, or neuromuscular disease leads to sustained venous hypertension.",
      "technical_details": "The calf muscle pump comprises the gastrocnemius, soleus, tibialis posterior, and peroneal muscles surrounding the deep venous sinusoids. During contraction (systole), blood is expelled proximally through competent valves. During relaxation (diastole), valves close preventing reflux while superficial veins refill deep veins through perforators. Ejection fraction averages 65% per contraction cycle with a filling time of 2-3 seconds in healthy individuals.",
      "common_misconceptions": [
        "Misconception: The heart alone is responsible for venous return. Reality: Below the heart, the muscle pump is essential for overcoming hydrostatic pressure.",
        "Misconception: Varicose veins cause muscle pump failure. Reality: Muscle pump dysfunction is often primary, with varicose veins developing as a consequence.",
        "Misconception: Compression stockings replace muscle pump function. Reality: Compression augments but cannot substitute for active muscle contraction."
