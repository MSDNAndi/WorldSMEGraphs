    "statement": {
      "text": "Venous valves are bicuspid intimal folds that ensure unidirectional blood flow toward the heart, segment the hydrostatic column to reduce pressure, and enable efficient muscle pump function. Valve incompetence causing reflux >0.5 seconds (superficial) or >1 second (deep) is pathologic.",
      "formal": "Pathologic_Reflux: Superficial_Veins > 0.5 seconds; Deep_Veins > 1.0 seconds; Perforators > 0.35-0.5 seconds"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Venous valves work like one-way swing doors - they open easily when blood is pushed toward the heart, but slam shut when blood tries to flow backward. When these doors become damaged or don't close properly, blood repeatedly falls back down the leg with each heartbeat, causing pressure buildup.",
      "key_insight": "Valve closure is passive, driven by pressure gradient reversal. When you stand up, the blood column above the valve falls back, but the cusps catch it and close within milliseconds. Prolonged closure time (>0.5 seconds) indicates the cusps are damaged, dilated, or destroyed - defining pathologic reflux.",
      "technical_details": "Venous valves are bicuspid structures with leaflets composed of endothelium overlying a connective tissue core. They arise from intimal folds at slight venous dilations called valve sinuses. The sinuses create eddy currents during flow that begin valve closure before flow reversal. Valve distribution varies: calf deep veins have the most valves, decreasing proximally. The external iliac and IVC are typically valveless. Valve failure can be primary (degenerative) or secondary (post-thrombotic damage, dilation from volume overload).",
      "common_misconceptions": [
        "Misconception: All reflux indicates valve destruction. Reality: Mild reflux can occur from venous dilation stretching the valve annulus without cusp damage.",
        "Misconception: Valves actively close. Reality: Valve closure is passive, driven by pressure gradient reversal creating retrograde flow that catches the cusps.",
        "Misconception: Valve function can be restored. Reality: Once valves are destroyed (especially post-thrombotic), they cannot regenerate; only surgical valve reconstruction can restore function."
