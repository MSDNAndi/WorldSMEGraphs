      "text": "Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) is the gold standard for assessing iliofemoral venous obstruction, providing cross-sectional imaging that reveals stenoses underestimated by venography and guiding optimal stent sizing and positioning.",

    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "IVUS is like putting a tiny ultrasound camera inside the blood vessel to see the wall from the inside. It shows the true shape and size of the vein, which contrast pictures from the outside often miss.",
      "key_insight": "Venography significantly underestimates venous stenosis because it shows only the contrast-filled lumen, not external compression or eccentric webs. IVUS reveals 30-40% more obstruction than venography alone.",
      "technical_details": "Technique: catheter-based rotating transducer or phased array. Assessment: cross-sectional area, diameter, wall characteristics, trabeculations, webs. Stenosis criteria: >50% area reduction compared to normal reference segment. Findings: external compression (May-Thurner shows flattened lumen), webs/synechiae (post-thrombotic), wall thickening. Use: pre-stent sizing, landing zone selection, post-stent assessment. Limitations: cost, learning curve, catheter size."
