      "text": "Incompetent perforating veins (IPVs) contribute to venous hypertension and may require treatment when symptomatic or associated with skin changes/ulcers. Treatment options include percutaneous ablation (thermal, sclerotherapy) and surgical ligation (SEPS), with patient selection guided by location, size, and clinical context.",
      "formal": "Pathologic_IPV: Diameter >3.5mm + Outward_Flow_Duration >0.5sec + Subulcer/Symptomatic_Location"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Perforating veins are like doors connecting the superficial and deep venous systems. When the door's valve fails, pressure from the deep system 'blows back' into the superficial system during calf muscle contraction, causing localized venous hypertension, skin damage, and ulceration.",
      "key_insight": "Not all incompetent perforators require treatment. The SVS/AVF guidelines identify 'pathologic' perforators as those with diameter >3.5mm, outward flow >0.5 seconds, and located beneath healed or active ulcers (CEAP C5/C6) or in patients with primary reflux failing conservative therapy.",
      "technical_details": "Perforator veins occur in predictable locations: paratibial (Cockett I, II, III), posterior tibial, medial and lateral calf, and thigh (mid-thigh, Hunterian/Dodd). Duplex identifies IPVs by demonstrating outward flow >0.5 seconds with augmentation. PAPS (percutaneous ablation of perforator system) using RFA or laser is the most common treatment. SEPS (subfascial endoscopic perforator surgery) is reserved for extensive disease but has declined with percutaneous options. Ultrasound-guided foam sclerotherapy is an alternative for smaller perforators.",
      "common_misconceptions": [
        "Misconception: All incompetent perforators must be treated. Reality: Only 'pathologic' perforators (>3.5mm, >0.5sec outward flow, symptomatic location) warrant treatment.",
        "Misconception: Perforator treatment alone heals ulcers. Reality: Superficial and deep disease must be addressed; perforator treatment is adjunctive.",
        "Misconception: SEPS is the gold standard. Reality: Percutaneous ablation has equivalent efficacy with less morbidity."
