    "statement": {
      "text": "Nutcracker syndrome (NCS) is symptomatic compression of the left renal vein (LRV) between the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) anteriorly and the aorta posteriorly (anterior NCS), or between the aorta and vertebral column in retroaortic LRV (posterior NCS). This causes left renal venous hypertension, presenting with hematuria, left flank pain, and/or left-sided varicocele.",
      "formal": "Nutcracker: LRV compression (anterior: SMA-aorta; posterior: aorta-spine) → renal venous HTN → hematuria, flank pain, varicocele"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "The left renal vein is like a garden hose caught in the 'nutcracker' formed by two arteries - the aorta below and the SMA above. When they squeeze too tightly (like nutcracker jaws), blood can't drain properly from the left kidney. This causes pressure buildup leading to bleeding (hematuria), pain, and backup into other veins (varicocele, pelvic congestion).",
      "key_insight": "Nutcracker syndrome is underdiagnosed because its symptoms (hematuria, flank pain) are nonspecific. The key is recognizing the constellation of symptoms and confirming with appropriate imaging showing LRV compression and pressure gradient.",
      "technical_details": "Normal SMA-aortic angle is 38-56°. In NCS, this angle is typically <35° (often <10°) causing LRV compression. Diagnosis requires: (1) anatomic compression on CT/MRI (LRV diameter ratio >4:1 hilar:aortic), (2) elevated reno-caval pressure gradient (>3 mmHg), and (3) compatible symptoms. May occur with or without anatomic abnormality - some patients with narrow angles are asymptomatic."
