    "statement": {
      "text": "May-Thurner syndrome (MTS) is compression of the left common iliac vein by the overlying right common iliac artery against the lumbar vertebrae, causing intimal changes (venous spur), stenosis, and predisposition to left iliofemoral DVT. MTS underlies 50-60% of left-sided iliofemoral DVT cases.",
      "formal": "May-Thurner: Left CIV compression by right CIA → venous spur → stenosis/DVT; 50-60% of left iliofemoral DVT; F>M, age 20-40"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Imagine a garden hose (the left iliac vein) trapped between a rock (the spine) and a pulsating pump tube (the right iliac artery). Over time, this constant pressure damages the hose wall and narrows its opening. Blood flow slows in this narrowed section, which is the perfect setup for a clot to form.",
      "key_insight": "MTS is underdiagnosed because it's only symptomatic when complicated by DVT or in severe stenosis. When a young person (especially a woman) presents with left leg DVT, always suspect underlying May-Thurner anatomy and image the iliac veins.",
      "technical_details": "The anatomic compression occurs where the left common iliac vein crosses posterior to the right common iliac artery at the L5 vertebral body level. Chronic pulsatile compression causes intimal proliferation and formation of intraluminal webs or 'spurs' (Cockett's syndrome). IVUS shows >50% stenosis in symptomatic patients."
