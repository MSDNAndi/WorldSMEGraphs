## Issues Identified

### Minor Issues (Corrected)

#### 1. Colonic Ischemia Definition Redundancy ✅ FIXED
- **Location**: Section 9.4 (lines ~1105-1107)
- **Issue**: Definition of colonic ischemia appeared twice in consecutive paragraphs
- **Fix Applied**: Consolidated introductory statements into single sentence

#### 2. Base Deficit Terminology ✅ FIXED
- **Location**: Table 4.1 in Section 4.1
- **Issue**: Used "Base deficit" alone
- **Fix Applied**: Updated to "Base excess/deficit" for completeness

#### 3. Answer Key Format ✅ ENHANCED
- **Location**: Section 20, end of self-assessment questions
- **Issue**: Answer key was compressed single line
- **Fix Applied**: Reformatted as table with brief rationales for each answer

### No Critical Issues Identified

### No Major Issues Requiring Revision
