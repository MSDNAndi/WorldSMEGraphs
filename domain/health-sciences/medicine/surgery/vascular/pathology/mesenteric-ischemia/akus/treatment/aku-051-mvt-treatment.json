    "statement": {
      "text": "Mesenteric venous thrombosis (MVT) has distinct treatment principles from arterial ischemia: systemic anticoagulation is the cornerstone of therapy, surgical intervention is reserved for peritonitis or bowel necrosis, and long-term anticoagulation is typically required with duration determined by underlying etiology.",
      "formal": "MVT Treatment: (1) Anticoagulation (heparin → warfarin/DOAC); (2) Supportive care (bowel rest, fluids, antibiotics); (3) Surgery only for peritonitis/necrosis; (4) Consider interventional thrombolysis in selected cases; (5) Duration 3-6 months minimum, lifelong if prothrombotic state"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Unlike arterial mesenteric ischemia where blood can't get TO the bowel, venous thrombosis means blood can't get OUT—causing congestion, edema, and eventual infarction. The treatment approach is different: anticoagulation allows the body's fibrinolytic system to work while preventing clot propagation. Surgery is only needed when the bowel has already died.",
      "key_insight": "MVT has a more forgiving timeline than arterial ischemia, but the window for intervention is still limited. Early anticoagulation prevents clot extension and allows collateral formation. The challenge is recognizing MVT early enough that anticoagulation alone can prevent necrosis.",
      "technical_details": "Heparin anticoagulation should be initiated immediately upon diagnosis. LMWH may be used but UFH offers reversibility if surgery becomes necessary. Transition to oral anticoagulation after stabilization. Work up for underlying hypercoagulable state is essential."
