      "text": "The critical care physician plays an essential role in mesenteric ischemia as the frontline provider for NOMI recognition in ICU patients, perioperative resuscitation, and long-term management of survivors; understanding the intensivist perspective enhances collaborative care and improves outcomes.",
      "formal": "ICU Role: (1) NOMI recognition in at-risk patients (vasopressors, cardiac surgery, shock); (2) Resuscitation optimization; (3) Post-operative management after revascularization/resection; (4) Goals of care discussions; (5) Long-term rehabilitation"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "NOMI is predominantly an ICU problem—it occurs in critically ill patients who are already being managed by intensivists. The challenge is recognizing mesenteric ischemia in patients who may be sedated, intubated, and unable to report symptoms. Surgeons must understand this challenge and work collaboratively with ICU teams for early detection.",
      "key_insight": "The intensivist sees mesenteric ischemia from a different lens: as a complication of systemic illness, not a primary surgical problem. Prevention (optimizing perfusion, minimizing vasopressors), early recognition, and post-operative support are their primary contributions.",
      "technical_details": "ICU patients at highest risk for NOMI include those on high-dose vasopressors, post-cardiac surgery (especially CABG, valve), post-major aortic surgery, and those with cardiogenic or septic shock. Feeding intolerance, rising lactate, and unexplained acidosis are key warning signs."
