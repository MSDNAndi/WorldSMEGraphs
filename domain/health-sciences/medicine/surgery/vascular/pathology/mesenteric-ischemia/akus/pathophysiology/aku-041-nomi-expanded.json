    "statement": {
      "text": "Nonocclusive mesenteric ischemia (NOMI) is intestinal ischemia without mechanical vascular obstruction, resulting from sustained splanchnic vasoconstriction in low-flow states, with the highest mortality of all mesenteric ischemia subtypes (70-90%) due to its occurrence in critically ill patients and difficulty in early recognition.",
      "formal": "NOMI Pathophysiology: Low cardiac output OR Hypovolemia OR Vasopressors → Sympathetic activation → Splanchnic vasoconstriction → Mucosal hypoxia → Ischemic injury (diffuse, patchy) → Necrosis if sustained"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "NOMI is 'mesenteric ischemia without a clot.' The blood vessels are open, but the body is shunting blood away from the gut to preserve vital organs. It's like a drought where the river is technically there, but no water is flowing. This typically happens in the sickest ICU patients who are already fighting for their lives.",
      "key_insight": "NOMI is the 'stealth killer' of mesenteric ischemia. Unlike embolic or thrombotic disease, there is no filling defect on CTA to identify. The vessels are patent but vasoconstricted. The diagnosis requires recognizing the clinical context (shock, vasopressors) and interpreting subtle imaging findings (poor bowel enhancement, patent vessels).",
      "technical_details": "The mesenteric circulation receives sympathetic innervation that causes vasoconstriction during stress. This is normally protective (redirecting blood to heart and brain), but when sustained, it causes intestinal ischemia. The autoregulatory capacity of the splanchnic bed can maintain adequate perfusion down to about 40% of normal flow, below which ischemia develops."
