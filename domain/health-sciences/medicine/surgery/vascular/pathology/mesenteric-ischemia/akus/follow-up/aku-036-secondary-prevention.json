    "statement": {
      "text": "Secondary prevention after mesenteric ischemia treatment is essential because these patients have extensive systemic atherosclerosis with high cardiovascular event rates; comprehensive risk factor modification including antiplatelet therapy, statins, blood pressure control, smoking cessation, and diabetes management reduces the risk of mesenteric restenosis, cardiovascular events, and death.",
      "formal": "Secondary Prevention: Antiplatelet (all patients post-stent); Statin (LDL goal <70); ACE inhibitor/ARB if HTN or DM; Smoking cessation (most modifiable risk); DM control (HbA1c <7-8%); Exercise and diet counseling"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Mesenteric ischemia from atherosclerosis is not an isolated disease—it's a manifestation of systemic vascular disease. These patients have coronary disease, cerebrovascular disease, and peripheral arterial disease. Treating the mesenteric arteries without addressing the underlying process is treating a symptom, not the disease.",
      "key_insight": "Cardiovascular events (MI, stroke) are a leading cause of death in mesenteric ischemia survivors—arguably more common than mesenteric disease recurrence. Aggressive secondary prevention may provide more survival benefit than the index mesenteric intervention.",
