    "statement": {
      "text": "Chronic mesenteric ischemia (CMI), or 'intestinal angina,' is recurrent postprandial abdominal pain caused by inadequate intestinal blood flow during the increased metabolic demand of digestion. Classic triad: postprandial pain, food fear, and weight loss. Typically requires stenosis/occlusion of at least two of three mesenteric vessels (celiac, SMA, IMA) due to extensive collateral networks.",
      "formal": "CMI: Intestinal angina from mesenteric atherosclerosis; Classic triad: postprandial pain (15-30min after eating), sitophobia (food fear), weight loss; Usually requires 2-vessel disease"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "CMI is like cardiac angina, but for the intestines. Just as a narrowed coronary artery causes chest pain during exercise when the heart needs more blood, narrowed mesenteric arteries cause abdominal pain during digestion when the gut needs more blood. Patients learn to fear eating because it causes pain, leading to profound weight loss.",
      "key_insight": "The mesenteric circulation has rich collateral networks, so usually 2 of 3 major vessels must be severely diseased before symptoms occur. This means CMI patients are at high risk for acute mesenteric ischemia if the remaining vessel occludes. Revascularization prevents both symptoms and progression to AMI.",
      "technical_details": "Mesenteric blood flow increases 100-150% postprandially. With stenosis, this demand can't be met, causing 'intestinal angina.' Collaterals include the arc of Riolan, marginal artery of Drummond, and meandering mesenteric artery. Single-vessel disease rarely causes CMI (except severe isolated SMA stenosis)."
