    "statement": {
      "text": "Endovascular treatment for mesenteric ischemia includes percutaneous transluminal angioplasty with stenting for chronic stenosis, catheter-directed thrombolysis or aspiration thrombectomy for acute occlusion, offering less invasive revascularization with the trade-off of inability to directly assess bowel viability.",
      "formal": "Endovascular Approach: CTA diagnosis → Arterial access → Selective catheterization → Thrombolysis/Thrombectomy/Angioplasty/Stenting → Surveillance"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Endovascular treatment is like unclogging a drain from the inside rather than digging up the pipe. Using catheters threaded through blood vessels, you can dissolve clots, suck out debris, or push open narrowed arteries and hold them open with stents. It's less invasive but you can't directly look at or touch the bowel.",
      "key_insight": "The fundamental dilemma with endovascular-first approach in acute mesenteric ischemia is that you cannot assess bowel viability. This makes patient selection critical: endovascular is excellent for the stable patient without peritonitis, but delayed recognition of dead bowel can be fatal. Close monitoring and low threshold for laparotomy are essential.",
      "technical_details": "SMA intervention typically uses femoral or brachial access. For acute occlusion, aspiration thrombectomy or pharmacomechanical thrombectomy are preferred over prolonged thrombolysis due to time constraints. For chronic disease, balloon-expandable stents are preferred at the ostium due to radial force requirements."
