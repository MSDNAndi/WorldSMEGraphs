    "statement": {
      "text": "Bowel resection in mesenteric ischemia involves removal of nonviable intestinal segments with appropriate margins, followed by either primary anastomosis or stoma creation depending on patient stability and bowel perfusion, with planned second-look laparotomy as a critical safety net for uncertain viability.",
      "formal": "Bowel Resection: Identify necrosis → Resect to viable margins → Anastomosis (if stable, good perfusion) OR Stoma (if unstable, questionable) + Consider second-look"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Once we've restored blood flow, we need to remove any bowel that has already died - dead bowel will lead to sepsis and death. But we also need to decide how to handle the remaining bowel ends: connect them back together (anastomosis) or bring them out as stomas. This decision depends on how sick the patient is and how confident we are in the bowel's blood supply.",
      "key_insight": "The anastomosis decision is not just about the bowel - it's about the patient. A well-constructed anastomosis in a patient who is cold, acidotic, and on multiple pressors has a very high leak rate. Sometimes the safest option is to create stomas and return later for anastomosis when the patient has recovered."
