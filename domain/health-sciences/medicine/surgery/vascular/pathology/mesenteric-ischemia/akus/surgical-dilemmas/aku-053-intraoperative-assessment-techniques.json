      "text": "Intraoperative bowel viability assessment combines clinical inspection (color, peristalsis, bleeding) with adjunctive technologies including handheld Doppler, indocyanine green (ICG) fluorescence angiography, and laser Doppler flowmetry; no single technique is 100% accurate, and planned second-look laparotomy remains essential when viability is uncertain.",
      "formal": "Viability Assessment: Clinical (color, peristalsis, bleeding margins) + Adjuncts (Handheld Doppler, ICG fluorescence, laser Doppler) → Resect clearly dead bowel, preserve questionable segments, plan second-look at 24-48 hours"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "When you open the abdomen after mesenteric revascularization, some bowel may be obviously dead (black, no bleeding, no movement) and some obviously viable (pink, bleeding, peristaltic). The challenge is the bowel in between—dusky, questionable, 'maybe okay.' Getting this assessment right determines whether the patient survives with adequate gut or dies from sepsis (left too much dead bowel) or short bowel syndrome (resected too much).",
      "key_insight": "No adjunctive technology replaces careful clinical assessment, but they add objective data. ICG fluorescence is becoming the most popular adjunct because it directly visualizes perfusion. However, perfusion at the time of assessment may not predict what will happen in the next 24-48 hours—hence the importance of second-look.",
      "technical_details": "ICG is a fluorescent dye that binds to plasma proteins and fluoresces when illuminated with near-infrared light. After IV injection, it shows perfusion patterns in real-time. Lack of fluorescence indicates no arterial inflow. Doppler assessment detects flow in mesenteric arcade vessels."
