    "statement": {
      "text": "Ischemia-reperfusion (I-R) injury is a paradoxical phenomenon where restoration of blood flow to ischemic intestine triggers a cascade of oxidative stress, inflammatory mediator release, and systemic inflammatory response that can cause remote organ dysfunction and death, even when the bowel appears viable after revascularization.",
      "formal": "Reperfusion Cascade: Revascularization → Oxygen reintroduction → ROS generation → Endothelial injury → Inflammatory mediator release → Systemic inflammation (SIRS) → MODS → Death (if severe)"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "The surgeon's goal is to restore blood flow to the ischemic intestine. Paradoxically, the return of oxygenated blood can cause additional injury beyond what the ischemia itself caused. Think of it like reopening a fire-damaged building - the fire is out, but the water damage from the fire trucks may now cause the structure to collapse.",
      "key_insight": "I-R injury explains why some patients deteriorate or die after apparently successful revascularization with viable bowel. The local intestinal injury releases a 'cytokine storm' that affects distant organs, particularly the lungs, kidneys, and heart. Post-operative management must anticipate and mitigate this systemic response.",
      "technical_details": "The molecular mechanisms involve: (1) ATP depletion during ischemia leading to xanthine oxidase accumulation, (2) oxygen reintroduction generating reactive oxygen species (ROS), (3) endothelial dysfunction and increased permeability, (4) neutrophil activation and sequestration, (5) complement activation, (6) release of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1, IL-6), (7) bacterial translocation through damaged mucosa."
