      "text": "Anticoagulation with heparin should be initiated immediately upon clinical suspicion of acute mesenteric ischemia, serving to prevent thrombus propagation, limit ischemic extension, and is essential for all etiologies including embolism, thrombosis, and mesenteric venous thrombosis.",

    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Anticoagulation is like putting out a fire: the clot that's already there may have caused damage, but if you can prevent it from spreading, you can limit the damage. Starting heparin immediately is one of the few things we can do while arranging for CT and surgery that actually helps the patient.",
      "key_insight": "Unlike many treatments that require confirmation of diagnosis, heparin should be started on CLINICAL SUSPICION of AMI. The risks of anticoagulation are far outweighed by the benefits of preventing thrombus propagation. Do not wait for CT confirmation to start heparin."
