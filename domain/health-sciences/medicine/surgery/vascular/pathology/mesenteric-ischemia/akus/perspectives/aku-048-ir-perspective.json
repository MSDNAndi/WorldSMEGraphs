    "statement": {
      "text": "The interventional radiologist plays a critical role in mesenteric ischemia care as both diagnostician (often first to identify ischemia on CT) and interventionalist; effective collaboration with vascular surgeons requires mutual understanding of each specialty's capabilities, limitations, and the complementary nature of endovascular and open surgical approaches.",
      "formal": "IR Role: (1) Diagnostic imaging interpretation (CTA, may first identify AMI); (2) Endovascular intervention (thrombectomy, thrombolysis, angioplasty/stenting); (3) NOMI management (vasodilator infusion); (4) Collaboration with surgery for hybrid/staged approaches"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "In many institutions, the interventional radiologist is called first for acute mesenteric ischemia because they perform the diagnostic angiography and can immediately transition to intervention. Understanding the IR perspective helps surgeons communicate effectively, plan hybrid approaches, and recognize when endovascular treatment is preferred vs. when open surgery is necessary.",
      "key_insight": "The IR-surgery relationship should be collaborative, not competitive. The best outcomes often come from combined approaches—IR for rapid revascularization, surgery for bowel assessment and resection. Pre-procedural communication about clinical status and surgical backup is essential.",
      "technical_details": "IRs bring expertise in catheter navigation, device selection, and radiation management. They may have earlier access to newer devices and techniques. However, they typically rely on surgeons for bowel viability assessment and resection decisions."
