    "statement": {
      "text": "Mechanical thrombectomy using aspiration or rheolytic devices has emerged as a first-line endovascular treatment for acute mesenteric arterial occlusion, offering rapid revascularization with lower bleeding risk compared to catheter-directed thrombolysis, and increasingly replacing pharmacological lysis in contemporary practice.",
      "formal": "Mechanical Thrombectomy: Aspiration (Indigo, Penumbra CAT) → Suction removes thrombus; Rheolytic (AngioJet) → Saline jet fragmentation + aspiration; Technical success: 80-95%; Advantages: Rapid, lower bleeding vs CDT; May combine with CDT or angioplasty/stenting"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Time is bowel—every hour of ischemia increases the extent of irreversible necrosis. Traditional catheter-directed thrombolysis (CDT) could take 12-24+ hours, during which bowel injury continues. Mechanical thrombectomy can restore flow in minutes to hours, reducing the ischemic burden and potentially salvaging more bowel.",
      "key_insight": "The shift from thrombolysis to mechanical thrombectomy mirrors the evolution in stroke and pulmonary embolism treatment. Rapid clot removal is preferable to slow dissolution. Modern aspiration devices can effectively remove large thrombus volumes with minimal adjunctive lysis.",
      "technical_details": "Large-bore aspiration catheters (6-8 Fr) can directly engage and aspirate soft thrombus. Rheolytic devices create a Venturi effect to fragment and remove clot. Combination strategies (aspiration + local lysis + angioplasty) are common. Post-thrombectomy imaging assesses need for stenting of underlying lesion."
