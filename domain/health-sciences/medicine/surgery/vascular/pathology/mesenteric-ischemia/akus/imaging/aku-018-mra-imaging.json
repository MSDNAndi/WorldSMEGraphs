    "statement": {
      "text": "Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) provides non-invasive evaluation of the mesenteric vasculature without ionizing radiation and with excellent soft tissue contrast; however, it is generally considered second-line to CTA for mesenteric ischemia due to longer acquisition times, motion artifact susceptibility, and limited availability in emergency settings.",
      "formal": "MRA Role: Alternative to CTA when iodinated contrast contraindicated or radiation concerns; Sensitivity/Specificity for stenosis: 90-100%/90-95%; Limitations: Motion artifact, time-consuming, claustrophobia, pacemakers"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "MRA uses magnetic fields and radiofrequency pulses to generate images of blood vessels without radiation. For mesenteric evaluation, contrast-enhanced MRA (CE-MRA) with gadolinium provides excellent visualization of the major mesenteric arteries. The technology is excellent for chronic disease but less practical for acute emergencies.",
      "key_insight": "MRA's primary advantage is avoiding iodinated contrast (important for renal insufficiency) and ionizing radiation (important for young patients or surveillance). However, the longer scan times and requirement for patient cooperation make it less suitable than CTA for acute mesenteric ischemia.",
      "technical_details": "Modern MRA techniques include contrast-enhanced (CE-MRA), time-of-flight (TOF), and phase-contrast imaging. CE-MRA with gadolinium provides the best vessel visualization. Non-contrast techniques (SSFP, ASL) are emerging for patients who cannot receive gadolinium."
