    "statement": {
      "text": "The decision to transfer a patient with suspected mesenteric ischemia to a higher-level center versus operating locally represents a critical systems-level dilemma, balancing the delay inherent in transfer against the superior resources at tertiary centers, with the optimal decision depending on local capabilities, patient stability, and disease severity.",
      "formal": "Transfer Decision Matrix: Patient stability × Disease severity × Local capability × Transfer time → Operate locally OR Transfer (stabilize and go) OR Transfer (go immediately)"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "A general surgeon at a community hospital faces a patient with probable mesenteric ischemia at 2 AM. The nearest vascular surgeon is 100 miles away. Should she operate now with the skills and resources available, or load the patient into an ambulance for a 2-hour transfer? The answer depends on many factors, and both choices carry significant risk.",
      "key_insight": "The dilemma is that mesenteric ischemia is time-critical, but so is having the right expertise. The mortality benefit of vascular surgery expertise may be lost if the patient dies or develops irreversible necrosis during transfer. However, operating without appropriate skills or equipment may lead to incomplete revascularization or uncontrolled complications.",
      "technical_details": "Studies suggest that outcomes for mesenteric ischemia are better at high-volume centers with vascular surgery and interventional radiology capability. However, these studies have selection bias (sicker patients don't survive transfer). The '6-hour window' for bowel viability provides a rough guide, but individual variation is significant."
