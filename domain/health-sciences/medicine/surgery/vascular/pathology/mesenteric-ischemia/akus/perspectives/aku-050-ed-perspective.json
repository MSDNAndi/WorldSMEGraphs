      "text": "The emergency physician is often the first clinician to encounter mesenteric ischemia and bears the critical responsibility of maintaining high suspicion, initiating appropriate workup, starting resuscitation, and rapidly engaging surgical consultation—delays at this stage directly impact mortality.",

    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "The emergency department is where many mesenteric ischemia cases are won or lost. The patient with vague abdominal pain, atrial fibrillation, and 'pain out of proportion' may look like many other patients in the ED. The emergency physician's ability to recognize the pattern and act decisively determines whether the patient gets to the OR in time.",
      "key_insight": "The ED physician doesn't need to diagnose mesenteric ischemia definitively—they need to suspect it early, order the right test (CTA), start empiric treatment, and get the surgeon involved. Speed trumps certainty in this disease.",
      "technical_details": "Key ED actions: (1) Low threshold for CTA in patients with abdominal pain + vascular risk factors; (2) Start IV fluids and broad-spectrum antibiotics; (3) Consider heparin bolus if high suspicion and no contraindication; (4) Surgical consult before or immediately after CTA; (5) NPO and prepare for OR."
