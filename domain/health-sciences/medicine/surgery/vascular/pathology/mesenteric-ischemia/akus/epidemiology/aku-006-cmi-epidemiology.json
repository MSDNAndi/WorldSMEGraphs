    "statement": {
      "text": "Chronic mesenteric ischemia (CMI) is a relatively rare condition with an estimated incidence of 1-2 per 100,000 population, predominantly affecting elderly patients with extensive atherosclerotic disease; however, its true prevalence is likely underestimated due to nonspecific symptoms and the absence of sensitive screening tests.",
      "formal": "CMI Incidence: ~1-2/100,000/year; Female:Male ratio ~3:1; Mean age 60-70 years; >95% due to atherosclerosis"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "CMI represents the intestinal equivalent of stable angina pectoris—a supply-demand mismatch that manifests with meals. It typically occurs when at least two of the three mesenteric vessels are significantly stenosed or occluded, though single-vessel disease can cause symptoms in some patients.",
      "key_insight": "The female predominance (3:1) in CMI is notable and may relate to smaller vessel caliber, hormonal factors, or referral patterns. Many patients experience a prolonged diagnostic delay (average 18-24 months) due to the nonspecific nature of postprandial pain.",
      "technical_details": "Autopsy studies show significant (>50%) stenosis of at least one mesenteric vessel in 6-10% of elderly patients, yet symptomatic CMI is rare—demonstrating the robust collateral circulation of the mesenteric system."
