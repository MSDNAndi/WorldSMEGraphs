      "text": "Nutritional management is a cornerstone of mesenteric ischemia care, addressing pre-existing malnutrition in chronic disease, optimizing perioperative status, and managing the complex nutritional needs of patients with short bowel syndrome or intestinal failure after acute events.",
      "formal": "Nutrition Priorities: CMI → Correct malnutrition pre-/post-operatively; AMI → Assess gut function, advance diet as tolerated, TPN if needed; SBS → Intestinal rehabilitation program, goal enteral autonomy"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Malnutrition is both a consequence and a complicating factor in mesenteric ischemia. Chronic patients avoid eating due to pain; acute patients may lose absorptive capacity. Optimizing nutrition improves healing, immune function, and outcomes. For SBS patients, sophisticated nutrition management can mean the difference between TPN dependence and enteral autonomy.",
      "key_insight": "Nutritional status is a modifiable factor affecting outcomes. Early nutritional intervention—whether enteral or parenteral—improves wound healing, reduces complications, and accelerates recovery. Malnutrition is not an inevitable consequence of mesenteric ischemia.",
      "technical_details": "Nutritional assessment includes BMI, albumin, prealbumin (transthyretin), and functional status. The ESPEN and ASPEN guidelines provide frameworks for nutritional support in surgical patients. Intestinal rehabilitation is a specialized field combining diet modification, medication, and sometimes surgical intervention."
