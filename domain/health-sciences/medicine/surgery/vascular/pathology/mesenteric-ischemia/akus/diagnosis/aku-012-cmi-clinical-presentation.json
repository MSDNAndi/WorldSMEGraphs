      "text": "Chronic mesenteric ischemia presents with the classic triad of postprandial abdominal pain (intestinal angina), food fear (sitophobia), and unintentional weight loss, resulting from inadequate blood flow to meet the increased metabolic demand of digestion.",
      "formal": "CMI Triad: Postprandial pain + Food fear + Weight loss = Classic presentation (but triad present in only 50-75%)"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Think of CMI like cardiac angina, but for the intestines. Just as heart angina occurs when blood flow to the heart cannot meet the demands of exertion, intestinal angina occurs when blood flow to the intestines cannot meet the demands of digestion. Eating becomes exercise for the gut - and just as a patient with angina avoids stairs, a patient with CMI avoids eating.",
      "key_insight": "The pathognomonic feature is the relationship between eating and pain. Unlike most GI disorders where people feel better after eating, CMI patients feel worse. They learn to avoid eating to avoid pain - leading to profound weight loss and the characteristic 'food fear' or sitophobia."
