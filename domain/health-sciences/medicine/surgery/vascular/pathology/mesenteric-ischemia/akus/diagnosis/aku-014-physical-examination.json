    "statement": {
      "text": "Physical examination in mesenteric ischemia ranges from deceptively benign in early acute disease (pain out of proportion to findings) to frank peritonitis in advanced bowel necrosis; the temporal evolution of physical findings provides critical prognostic information and guides the urgency of intervention.",
      "formal": "Physical Exam Spectrum: Early AMI → Soft abdomen despite severe pain (pain-examination gap); Late AMI → Peritonitis, hemodynamic instability; CMI → Cachexia, abdominal bruit, minimal acute findings"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "In early mesenteric ischemia, the gut is suffering silently—the serosa is not yet involved, so peritoneal signs are absent. The patient writhes in pain but the belly is soft. This 'pain out of proportion to physical findings' is the classic but easily missed clue. By the time peritonitis develops, transmural necrosis has occurred.",
      "key_insight": "The 'pain-examination gap' (severe subjective pain with minimal objective findings) in a patient with vascular risk factors should trigger immediate suspicion for mesenteric ischemia. This gap closes as disease progresses—and that closure heralds irreversible injury.",
      "technical_details": "The progression from normal exam to peritonitis can occur over 6-12 hours. Serial examinations are essential but must not delay imaging in suspicious cases. Abdominal distension may precede peritonitis due to ileus."
