    "statement": {
      "text": "Intestinal infarction represents irreversible transmural bowel necrosis resulting from prolonged ischemia, characterized by loss of mucosal barrier, bacterial translocation, systemic inflammatory response, and progression to perforation, peritonitis, and multi-organ failure if not surgically addressed.",
      "formal": "Intestinal Infarction: Prolonged ischemia (>6-12h) → Transmural necrosis → Mucosal barrier loss → Bacterial translocation → SIRS → Sepsis → MODS → Death"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "If ischemia is the process of the bowel slowly dying, infarction is when it's dead. Once the full thickness of the bowel wall has died, no amount of blood flow restoration will bring it back. At this point, the only treatment is resection. Dead bowel is not just useless - it's actively harmful, serving as a source of sepsis that will kill the patient if not removed.",
      "key_insight": "The distinction between reversible ischemia and irreversible infarction is the critical determination in mesenteric ischemia surgery. This distinction cannot always be made at the time of initial surgery, which is why second-look laparotomy is so important. Once infarction has occurred, revascularization alone is not enough - resection is mandatory."
