    "statement": {
      "text": "Acute arterial occlusion of the mesenteric vessels causes intestinal ischemia through either embolic lodging in the SMA (typically 3-10 cm from origin) or in-situ thrombosis of atherosclerotic stenosis, with distinct clinical patterns, collateral development, and prognosis for each mechanism.",
      "formal": "Arterial Occlusion → Tissue Hypoxia → ATP Depletion → Cell Death → Mucosal Barrier Loss → Bacterial Translocation → Sepsis → MODS"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Think of arterial embolism as a sudden dam breaking - the downstream effects are immediate and severe. In contrast, arterial thrombosis is like a dam that has been slowly silting up until it finally closes - the body may have had time to build bypass channels (collaterals), but the final closure is still catastrophic.",
      "key_insight": "The key difference between embolism and thrombosis is time for collateral development. Embolic occlusion is sudden with no collaterals, causing immediate severe ischemia. Thrombotic occlusion on chronic stenosis may have developed collaterals, but these are overwhelmed when complete occlusion occurs.",
      "technical_details": "Emboli typically lodge at branch points where vessel caliber decreases. The SMA's first major branch (middle colic) is approximately 3-10 cm from origin, explaining why emboli lodge here and spare proximal jejunum and colon while infarcting mid-gut territory."
