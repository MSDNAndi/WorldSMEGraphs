    "statement": {
      "text": "Nonocclusive Mesenteric Ischemia (NOMI) is intestinal ischemia without mechanical arterial or venous obstruction, caused by splanchnic vasoconstriction in response to low cardiac output states, hypovolemia, or vasopressor use, occurring predominantly in critically ill ICU patients with mortality rates of 50-90%.",
      "formal": "NOMI: Low-flow state → Splanchnic vasoconstriction → Redistributive shock → Intestinal hypoperfusion → Patchy ischemia → Diffuse bowel necrosis"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "When the body faces a life-threatening low blood pressure or blood loss, it prioritizes blood flow to the heart and brain by constricting blood vessels elsewhere. The intestines are 'sacrificed' in this triage, and their blood flow is severely reduced even though the arteries themselves are open. This is NOMI - death by deprioritization rather than obstruction.",
      "key_insight": "NOMI is the most insidious form of mesenteric ischemia because it occurs in already critically ill patients who cannot communicate symptoms, there is no anatomic lesion to fix, and diagnosis is often delayed or made at autopsy. Prevention and early recognition in high-risk patients are the only effective strategies.",
      "technical_details": "The mesenteric circulation is highly sensitive to catecholamines due to abundant alpha-1 adrenergic receptors. In shock states, endogenous catecholamines cause intense splanchnic vasoconstriction. Exogenous vasopressors, particularly norepinephrine and vasopressin, further exacerbate this. Digitalis and cocaine also cause mesenteric vasoconstriction."
