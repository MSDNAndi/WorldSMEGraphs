    "statement": {
      "text": "Acute mesenteric ischemia classically presents with sudden, severe periumbilical abdominal pain that is characteristically 'out of proportion' to physical examination findings, with early examination being deceptively benign until peritonitis develops indicating bowel necrosis.",
      "formal": "AMI Presentation: Sudden severe pain + Benign early exam + Risk factors → High clinical suspicion → Urgent CTA"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "In early AMI, the intestines are dying but the abdominal wall is not yet affected. The patient feels the visceral pain from the ischemic bowel intensely, but pressing on the abdomen doesn't hurt because the peritoneum is not inflamed yet. This 'symptom-sign gap' is the hallmark of early AMI and the key to early diagnosis.",
      "key_insight": "By the time peritoneal signs (guarding, rigidity, rebound tenderness) develop, transmural bowel necrosis has occurred. The goal of early recognition is to diagnose and treat BEFORE these ominous signs appear. A normal abdominal examination in a patient with severe pain should increase, not decrease, concern for AMI."
