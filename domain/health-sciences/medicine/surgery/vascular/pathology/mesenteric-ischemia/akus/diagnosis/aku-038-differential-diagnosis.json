    "statement": {
      "text": "The differential diagnosis of mesenteric ischemia encompasses a broad spectrum of abdominal emergencies that share overlapping clinical features, making early recognition challenging; systematic exclusion of mimics while maintaining high suspicion for ischemia is essential to avoid catastrophic delays in treatment.",
      "formal": "Diagnostic Reasoning: Abdominal pain + Risk factors → High suspicion → CTA → Confirm ischemia OR identify alternative diagnosis"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Mesenteric ischemia presents like many other abdominal emergencies, but the penalty for missing it is death. The challenge is that early AMI looks like many other conditions, and by the time it becomes obvious, it may be too late. The surgeon must simultaneously exclude mimics while fast-tracking workup for ischemia.",
      "key_insight": "The key differentiating features of mesenteric ischemia are: (1) pain severity out of proportion to physical findings early on, (2) presence of cardiac risk factors (especially atrial fibrillation), and (3) rapid clinical deterioration. Most mimics do not share all three features.",
      "technical_details": "CTA has largely replaced the diagnostic dilemma in centers where it is immediately available. The challenge remains in: (1) thinking of mesenteric ischemia early enough to order CTA, (2) interpreting subtle early findings, and (3) managing patients who present to facilities without CTA capability."
