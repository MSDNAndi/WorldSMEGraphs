      "text": "Loeys-Dietz syndrome exhibits a more aggressive vascular phenotype than Marfan syndrome, with arterial dissection and rupture occurring at smaller aortic diameters and affecting arteries throughout the body, requiring earlier surgical intervention.",
      "formal": "LDS_Phenotype: More_Aggressive → Dissection_at_Smaller_Size → Lower_Thresholds → Earlier_Surgery"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "If Marfan is concerning for aortic health, Loeys-Dietz is even more worrying. The arteries are more fragile and can tear at smaller sizes, and the disease can affect arteries anywhere in the body, not just the aorta.",
      "key_insight": "LDS aortic dissection can occur at diameters well below 5.0cm. Surgical thresholds are lower (4.0-4.2cm for most patients). Unique features include arterial tortuosity, aneurysms throughout the arterial tree, and hypertelorism/bifid uvula (craniofacial findings).",
      "technical_details": "Genes: TGFBR1/2 (types I/II), SMAD3 (type III), TGFB2 (type IV), TGFB3 (type V). Vascular features: aortic/arterial aneurysm, dissection, arterial tortuosity. Craniofacial: hypertelorism, bifid uvula, cleft palate. Surgical thresholds: 4.0-4.2cm root for most, may be higher for milder mutations. Surveillance: annual full aortic imaging, head-to-pelvis CTA/MRA at diagnosis. Medical therapy: beta-blockers (similar to Marfan), losartan may be beneficial."
