    "statement": {
      "text": "Aortic root replacement (Bentall procedure) is the definitive treatment for aortic root aneurysm in Marfan syndrome, involving replacement of the aortic valve, sinuses of Valsalva, and ascending aorta as a composite graft, with reimplantation of the coronary arteries, typically indicated when the root reaches 5.0 cm or at smaller sizes with risk factors.",
      "formal": "Bentall_Procedure = Composite_Valve_Graft + Sinus_Replacement + Coronary_Reimplantation"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "In Marfan syndrome, the weakest part of the aorta is the root - where the aorta starts and the coronary arteries come off. Instead of patching, we replace this entire section with a prefabricated tube that includes a new valve, then sew the coronary arteries into new holes in the tube.",
      "key_insight": "The Bentall procedure has been the gold standard for decades but requires lifelong anticoagulation for mechanical valves. Valve-sparing root replacement (David procedure) preserves the native valve when possible, avoiding anticoagulation - increasingly preferred in young patients with good valve quality.",
      "technical_details": "Indications for elective root replacement: Marfan with root ≥5.0 cm (ACC/AHA), some advocate 4.5 cm with risk factors (family history dissection, rapid growth >0.5 cm/year, pregnancy planned, severe regurgitation). Bentall technique: excise root, sew composite valve-graft proximally, create coronary buttons, reimplant coronaries to graft. Button technique (preferred) vs Cabrol technique (tube graft to coronary ostia). Valve options: mechanical (Bentall, requires anticoagulation) or bioprosthetic (for women desiring pregnancy, anticoagulation contraindication). Operative mortality: 1-3% in experienced centers. Long-term concerns: pseudoaneurysm at coronary buttons, need for reoperation if tissue extends."
