      "text": "Pregnancy in Marfan syndrome carries increased risk of aortic dissection due to hemodynamic stress and hormonal effects on connective tissue, with aortic root >4.0cm representing high risk requiring pre-pregnancy surgical intervention.",

    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Pregnancy puts extra stress on the heart and blood vessels - more blood volume, faster heart rate, hormonal changes that soften connective tissue. For a woman with an already weakened aorta from Marfan, this can trigger a dangerous aortic tear.",
      "key_insight": "Aortic dissection risk during pregnancy in Marfan is 1-10% depending on aortic size. Root diameter >4.0cm indicates high risk; elective root replacement before pregnancy is recommended. All pregnancies should be managed as high-risk with close monitoring.",
      "technical_details": "Risk factors: aortic root >4.0cm (major), rapid dilation, family history of dissection. Pre-pregnancy: consider prophylactic root replacement if >4.0cm. During pregnancy: continue beta-blockers (pregnancy category C), monthly echo in 3rd trimester, avoid Valsalva during delivery. Delivery: cesarean section if root >4.0cm or rapidly growing; otherwise vaginal delivery with epidural and assisted 2nd stage acceptable. Genetics: 50% transmission risk - consider genetic counseling."
