    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Instead of throwing away a functioning valve along with the diseased aorta, valve-sparing surgery keeps your own valve and rebuilds a new root around it. This avoids blood thinners and has a lower risk of valve-related complications.",
      "key_insight": "Valve-sparing is preferred in younger patients with Marfan who have normal or near-normal valve leaflets. The David reimplantation technique has better long-term freedom from aortic regurgitation than Yacoub remodeling in connective tissue disorders.",
      "technical_details": "David technique: aortic valve suspended inside a Dacron graft (reimplantation), provides stable annular support. Yacoub technique: sinuses recreated with graft scalloped to fit between commissures (remodeling), less annular support. Selection: David preferred in Marfan (annular stability), Yacoub for normal annulus. Requirements: experienced surgeon, normal or reparable leaflets, not severely calcified. Outcomes: 85-90% freedom from reoperation at 10-15 years."
