      "text": "Vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (vEDS/type IV EDS) is a life-threatening connective tissue disorder caused by COL3A1 mutations affecting type III collagen, characterized by thin translucent skin, arterial fragility leading to spontaneous rupture, and high surgical mortality due to tissue friability.",
      "formal": "vEDS = COL3A1_Mutation + Type_III_Collagen_Defect + Arterial_Fragility + High_Surgical_Risk"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Type III collagen is the main structural protein in blood vessel walls. When it's defective, arteries become like tissue paper - they can tear or rupture without warning. Surgery is extremely dangerous because sutures tear through the fragile tissue, and even touching vessels can cause them to fall apart.",
      "key_insight": "The median survival in vEDS is only 48 years due to arterial and organ rupture. The key clinical dilemma: these patients present with vascular emergencies requiring urgent surgery, but surgery itself has extremely high mortality (50% in some series). Conservative management and endovascular approaches when possible are preferred.",
      "technical_details": "vEDS results from heterozygous pathogenic variants in COL3A1 encoding type III procollagen. Diagnostic features: thin translucent skin with visible veins, easy bruising, characteristic facial features (thin nose and lips, small chin, large eyes), arterial/intestinal/uterine fragility. Villanueva criteria guide diagnosis. Arterial events: spontaneous dissection or rupture (carotid, vertebral, iliac, renal most common); may occur with minimal or no trauma. Surgical principles: avoid open surgery when possible; if unavoidable, use pledgeted sutures, avoid tension, be prepared for tissue disintegration. Celiprolol 200-400mg BID reduces arterial events (BBEST trial). Pregnancy is extremely high risk (12% maternal mortality)."
