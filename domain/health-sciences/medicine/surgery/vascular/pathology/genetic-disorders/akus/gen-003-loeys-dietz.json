      "text": "Loeys-Dietz syndrome is an autosomal dominant connective tissue disorder caused by mutations in TGF-beta signaling pathway genes (TGFBR1, TGFBR2, SMAD3, TGFB2, TGFB3), characterized by arterial aneurysms with aggressive behavior, arterial tortuosity, hypertelorism, and bifid uvula, requiring earlier surgical intervention than Marfan syndrome.",
      "formal": "Loeys_Dietz = TGF_Beta_Pathway_Mutation + Aggressive_Aneurysms + Arterial_Tortuosity + Hypertelorism + Bifid_Uvula"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Loeys-Dietz is like a more aggressive cousin of Marfan syndrome. The aneurysms grow faster and rupture at smaller sizes, so surgery is needed sooner. You can spot affected individuals by their wide-set eyes and split uvula in the throat.",
      "key_insight": "The aggressive nature of Loeys-Dietz aneurysms means they rupture at smaller diameters than Marfan. Surgical thresholds are lower: aortic root replacement considered at 4.0-4.4 cm depending on gene mutation and family history, compared to 5.0 cm for Marfan. Unlike vEDS, surgery is tolerated well.",
      "technical_details": "Loeys-Dietz syndrome results from mutations in genes encoding TGF-beta receptors or ligands: TGFBR1 (LDS1), TGFBR2 (LDS2), SMAD3 (LDS3), TGFB2 (LDS4), TGFB3 (LDS5). Paradoxically, despite loss-of-function mutations, TGF-beta signaling is increased. Characteristic triad: arterial aneurysms/dissections with aggressive behavior (occur at younger age and smaller size), widespread arterial tortuosity (especially head/neck vessels), and craniofacial features (hypertelorism, cleft palate/bifid uvula). Additional features: cervical spine instability, thin skin, joint hypermobility, pes planus. Surgical threshold: aortic root 4.0 cm for severe phenotype, 4.4 cm for milder; earlier if rapid growth or family history of dissection at small size. Surgery is well-tolerated (unlike vEDS)."
