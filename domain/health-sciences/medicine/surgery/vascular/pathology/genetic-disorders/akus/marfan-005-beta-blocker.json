    "statement": {
      "text": "Beta-blocker therapy in Marfan syndrome reduces the rate of aortic root dilation and dissection risk by decreasing heart rate and blood pressure, thereby lowering aortic wall stress (dP/dt), and is recommended for all patients regardless of aortic size.",
      "formal": "Beta-Blocker: ↓HR + ↓BP → ↓dP/dt → ↓Aortic_Wall_Stress → Slower_Dilation"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "The weaker aortic wall in Marfan is constantly stressed by each heartbeat. Beta-blockers act like shock absorbers - they slow the heart rate and reduce the force of each beat, giving the weakened aorta less of a pounding with every heartbeat.",
      "key_insight": "Beta-blocker therapy is first-line medical management for all Marfan patients. It reduces both the rate of aortic dilation and the risk of aortic complications. Target heart rate is <70 bpm at rest, <100 bpm with exercise.",
      "technical_details": "Mechanism: reduces dP/dt (rate of pressure rise), decreases heart rate, lowers blood pressure. Evidence: Shores et al showed 70% reduction in endpoint (death, CHF, aortic regurgitation, dissection, root surgery). Target: HR <70 bpm rest, <100 bpm exercise. Agents: atenolol most studied, any beta-blocker acceptable. Alternatives: losartan (ARB) - TGF-β antagonism, may be additive to beta-blocker. Contraindications: severe asthma, decompensated heart failure."
