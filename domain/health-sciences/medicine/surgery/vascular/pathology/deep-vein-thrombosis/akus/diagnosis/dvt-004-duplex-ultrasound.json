    "statement": {
      "text": "Compression ultrasound is the primary diagnostic modality for DVT. The diagnosis is made when a vein fails to compress fully under transducer pressure. Normal veins collapse completely; thrombosed veins show incompressibility with echogenic material. Sensitivity is 94-97% for proximal DVT; lower (63-75%) for isolated calf vein thrombosis.",
      "formal": "DVT Ultrasound Diagnosis: Incompressibility = DVT | Normal vein: complete collapse under pressure | Thrombosed vein: fails to compress | Sensitivity: 94-97% proximal, 63-75% distal | Specificity: 94-99%"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "A healthy vein is like a soft tube - when you press on it, it flattens completely. A vein with a clot is like a tube with a marble inside - no matter how hard you press, you can't flatten it completely. Ultrasound lets us watch this in real-time, making it easy to see if a vein is open (compresses) or blocked (doesn't compress).",
      "key_insight": "Compression ultrasound is so good at diagnosing proximal DVT that a negative study in a patient with high clinical suspicion should prompt serial imaging. The test is less reliable for calf vein DVT - if clinical suspicion is high and proximal veins are negative, either repeat in 5-7 days or do whole-leg imaging.",
      "technical_details": "Technique: Linear transducer (5-12 MHz) in transverse orientation. Apply firm pressure at 1-2 cm intervals from CFV to popliteal vein. Complete compression (anterior and posterior walls touch) = normal. Partial or no compression = DVT. Additional findings: echogenic material in lumen, increased vein diameter, loss of respiratory phasicity, absence of flow augmentation with calf squeeze. Proximal-only vs whole-leg: Proximal (CFV, SFV, popliteal) is quicker; whole-leg includes calf veins but has lower sensitivity. Serial strategy: if proximal negative on day 0, repeat day 5-7 to catch propagating calf DVT.",
      "common_misconceptions": [
        "Visible thrombus is required - incompressibility is the criterion, not visualization",
        "Negative ultrasound rules out DVT - false negatives occur, especially for calf DVT",
        "Doppler is essential for diagnosis - compression is sufficient, Doppler is supplementary",
        "Old DVT looks the same as new - chronic DVT may show partial compressibility, wall thickening"
