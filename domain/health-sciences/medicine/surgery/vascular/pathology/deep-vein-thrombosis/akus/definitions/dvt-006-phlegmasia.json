      "text": "Phlegmasia represents the spectrum of limb-threatening venous thrombosis: phlegmasia alba dolens (PAD - massive iliofemoral DVT with painful white swelling) progresses to phlegmasia cerulea dolens (PCD - cyanotic, severely swollen leg with impaired arterial inflow due to compartment pressure) and ultimately venous gangrene if untreated.",
      "formal": "Phlegmasia Spectrum: Alba Dolens (pale, painful, swollen) → Cerulea Dolens (blue, bullae, arterial compromise) → Venous Gangrene (tissue death)"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Phlegmasia is like a dam completely blocking a river. In phlegmasia alba dolens, the blockage causes severe backup (massive swelling) but some flow continues (pale). In phlegmasia cerulea dolens, the pressure gets so high that even arterial blood can't get in - the leg turns blue and starts dying. It's venous thrombosis so severe it causes arterial ischemia.",
      "key_insight": "Phlegmasia cerulea dolens is a surgical emergency requiring immediate intervention to save the limb. The progression from alba to cerulea dolens indicates impending venous gangrene with irreversible tissue loss.",
      "technical_details": "PCD involves near-total venous outflow obstruction causing tissue pressure exceeding capillary perfusion pressure, leading to arterial inflow impairment. Compartment syndrome physiology applies. Risk factors: malignancy (50%), HIT, hypercoagulable states, May-Thurner anatomy. Amputation rates without intervention: 20-50%."
