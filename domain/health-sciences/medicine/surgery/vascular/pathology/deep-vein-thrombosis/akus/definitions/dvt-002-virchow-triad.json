      "text": "Virchow's Triad describes the three pathophysiologic factors that promote venous thrombosis: (1) Venous stasis - slowed blood flow; (2) Endothelial injury - damage to vessel wall; (3) Hypercoagulability - increased propensity to clot. Understanding these three elements helps identify patients at risk and guides preventive strategies.",
      "formal": "Virchow's Triad: Stasis + Endothelial Injury + Hypercoagulability → Thrombus Formation | Any combination of factors can initiate DVT | Risk assessment involves identifying which elements are present"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Blood is designed to clot when there's a cut - that's good when you want to stop bleeding. But inside a vein, clotting is dangerous. Three things make inappropriate clotting more likely: (1) Slow flow - blood sitting still has more time to clot, like water getting stagnant in a pool; (2) Wall damage - injuries to the vein lining activate the clotting system; (3) Clotting tendency - some people's blood is 'stickier' due to genetics, medications, or medical conditions.",
      "key_insight": "Virchow's Triad isn't just historical - it's clinically actionable. When you assess a patient's DVT risk, you're really asking: What's causing stasis? Is there endothelial injury? Is there hypercoagulability? The more elements present, the higher the risk, and the more aggressive prevention should be.",
      "technical_details": "Rudolf Virchow proposed this triad in 1856, though the exact formulation has evolved. Modern understanding: (1) Stasis occurs in valve pockets where flow reverses, allowing local accumulation of activated clotting factors; (2) Endothelial injury exposes tissue factor and subendothelial collagen, triggering both extrinsic and intrinsic pathways; (3) Hypercoagulability includes both inherited thrombophilias (Factor V Leiden in 5% of Caucasians) and acquired states (malignancy, pregnancy, inflammation). The balance between procoagulant and anticoagulant factors determines whether thrombosis occurs.",
      "common_misconceptions": [
        "All three factors must be present for DVT - one or two may be sufficient",
        "Virchow's Triad is outdated - it remains the conceptual foundation for VTE prevention",
        "Stasis alone causes DVT - usually needs another factor to trigger thrombosis",
        "Hypercoagulability testing is needed for all DVT - not useful in most cases"
