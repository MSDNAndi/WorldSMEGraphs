      "text": "Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) is the formation of a blood clot in a deep vein, most commonly in the lower extremities. It represents part of the venous thromboembolism (VTE) spectrum that includes pulmonary embolism (PE). Risk factors are described by Virchow's triad: stasis, endothelial injury, and hypercoagulability.",

    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Blood is designed to clot when injured, but when it clots inside a vein inappropriately, that's DVT. Imagine a slow-moving stream where debris accumulates - the same happens in veins when blood flow slows (stasis), the vessel wall is damaged (injury), or the blood itself is prone to clotting (hypercoagulability). The danger of DVT extends beyond the leg: clots can break loose and travel to the lungs, causing pulmonary embolism, which can be fatal.",
      "key_insight": "DVT and PE are not separate diseases - they're two manifestations of the same process (VTE). About 50% of patients with proximal DVT have asymptomatic PE on imaging, and most fatal PEs arise from leg clots. Treatment addresses both conditions.",
      "technical_details": "Anatomically, DVT is classified by location: distal (calf veins) vs. proximal (popliteal and above). Proximal DVT carries much higher PE risk and requires anticoagulation; isolated distal DVT is more controversial. The iliofemoral segment (common iliac to common femoral) carries highest risk of post-thrombotic syndrome and may warrant aggressive intervention. Thrombosis typically begins in valve pockets where stasis is greatest, then propagates both proximally and distally.",
      "common_misconceptions": [
        "All leg swelling is DVT - many other causes (CHF, lymphedema, cellulitis)",
        "DVT always causes symptoms - up to 50% may be asymptomatic",
        "Negative D-dimer rules out DVT - only in low pre-test probability patients",
        "Calf DVT is harmless - ~25% propagate to proximal veins if untreated"
