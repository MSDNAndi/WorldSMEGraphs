    "statement": {
      "text": "The Wells Score is a clinical prediction rule used to estimate the pretest probability of DVT, guiding whether to proceed with D-dimer testing or imaging. Points are assigned for clinical features (leg swelling, tenderness, immobilization, prior DVT, malignancy, alternative diagnosis less likely). Score ≥2 = DVT likely (ultrasound indicated); Score <2 = DVT unlikely (D-dimer first).",
      "formal": "Wells DVT Score: Sum of points from 9 criteria | Score <2 = DVT Unlikely (NPV 95% if D-dimer negative) → D-dimer first | Score ≥2 = DVT Likely (prevalence 30-50%) → Ultrasound"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Not everyone with leg pain has a DVT. The Wells Score is a checklist that helps estimate how likely a DVT is before doing any tests. It counts up risk factors (recent surgery, cancer, swelling) and subtracts points if there's an obvious alternative explanation. Low-risk patients can avoid ultrasound if their D-dimer is negative. High-risk patients need ultrasound regardless of D-dimer.",
      "key_insight": "The Wells Score combined with D-dimer testing allows safe exclusion of DVT without imaging in about 30-50% of suspected cases. This 'two-step' approach - score first, then D-dimer if low risk - is more cost-effective and reduces unnecessary ultrasounds. The key is using the score to guide the diagnostic pathway, not to make the diagnosis itself.",
      "technical_details": "Original Wells criteria include 9 items: (1) Active cancer (+1); (2) Paralysis/immobilization (+1); (3) Bedridden >3 days or surgery <12 weeks (+1); (4) Tenderness along deep veins (+1); (5) Entire leg swollen (+1); (6) Calf swelling >3cm compared to other side (+1); (7) Pitting edema (+1); (8) Collateral superficial veins (+1); (9) Prior documented DVT (+1); (10) Alternative diagnosis as likely or more likely (-2). Score interpretation: <2 = DVT unlikely (prevalence 5-15%), ≥2 = DVT likely (prevalence 25-45%). In DVT unlikely group: negative D-dimer safely excludes DVT (sensitivity ~99%). In DVT likely group: proceed directly to ultrasound.",
      "common_misconceptions": [
        "Wells Score diagnoses DVT - it estimates probability to guide testing",
        "Low Wells Score means no DVT - low probability isn't zero, D-dimer still needed",
        "D-dimer works for everyone - only useful in 'DVT unlikely' group",
        "High D-dimer means DVT - D-dimer is sensitive but not specific"
