      "text": "Post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS) is a chronic complication of DVT affecting 20-50% of patients, characterized by leg pain, swelling, heaviness, skin changes, and venous ulceration. It results from venous hypertension due to residual obstruction and/or valvular incompetence from thrombus-induced valve damage.",
      "formal": "PTS: Chronic DVT complication (20-50%); Pathophysiology: venous HTN from obstruction + valve damage → reflux; Features: pain, edema, skin changes, ulcer; Villalta score for diagnosis/severity"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "When a blood clot forms in a vein, even after it dissolves, it often leaves behind scar tissue. This scar tissue can block the vein (like a partially clogged pipe) and destroy the one-way valves that keep blood flowing toward the heart. Without working valves, blood pools in the leg with gravity, causing chronic swelling, skin damage, and eventually ulcers.",
      "key_insight": "PTS is largely preventable or its severity reducible through adequate anticoagulation (preventing clot extension), compression (reducing venous pressure), and potentially early thrombus removal for iliofemoral DVT. Once established, PTS is chronic and management is symptom-focused.",
      "technical_details": "Thrombus resolution involves inflammation and fibrosis that damages venous valves. Valve destruction causes reflux; residual obstruction increases venous pressure. Ambulatory venous hypertension leads to capillary leak, inflammation, and tissue hypoxia. The Villalta scale (0-33 points) assesses 5 symptoms + 6 signs, with PTS defined as score ≥5 or presence of ulcer."
