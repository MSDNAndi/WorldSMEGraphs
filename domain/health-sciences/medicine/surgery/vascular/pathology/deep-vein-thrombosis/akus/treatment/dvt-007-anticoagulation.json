    "statement": {
      "text": "Anticoagulation is the cornerstone of DVT treatment, preventing thrombus extension, embolization, recurrence, and death. Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs: rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban, dabigatran) are first-line for most patients due to similar efficacy, better safety profile (less bleeding), and convenience compared to warfarin or LMWH.",
      "formal": "DVT Anticoagulation: DOACs preferred (rivaroxaban, apixaban) for most; LMWH for cancer, pregnancy; Warfarin if renal failure, antiphospholipid; Duration: 3-6mo (provoked), extended (unprovoked, recurrent)"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Anticoagulation doesn't dissolve the clot - your body does that naturally over weeks to months. What anticoagulation does is prevent the clot from growing larger and prevent new clots from forming while your body's clot-busting system works. It's like a ceasefire that lets the cleanup crew do their job without new messes being made.",
      "key_insight": "DOACs have revolutionized VTE treatment - they're as effective as traditional warfarin/heparin but with less major bleeding, no monitoring requirement, and fewer drug interactions. However, they're not appropriate for everyone - cancer patients, pregnant women, and those with antiphospholipid syndrome still need alternative approaches.",
      "technical_details": "DOACs work by directly inhibiting factor Xa (rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban) or thrombin (dabigatran). They have predictable pharmacokinetics allowing fixed dosing without monitoring. AMPLIFY and EINSTEIN trials established apixaban and rivaroxaban as standard of care. Duration based on whether DVT is provoked (3 months) or unprovoked (extended, reassess annually)."
