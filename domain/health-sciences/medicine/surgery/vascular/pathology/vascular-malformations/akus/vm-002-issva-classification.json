    "statement": {
      "text": "The ISSVA (International Society for the Study of Vascular Anomalies) classification divides vascular anomalies into two fundamental categories: vascular tumors (including hemangiomas that proliferate and involute) and vascular malformations (structural abnormalities present at birth that grow proportionally), with malformations further classified by the predominant vessel type involved.",
      "formal": "ISSVA_Classification: Vascular_Anomalies = Vascular_Tumors(Hemangioma, etc.) | Vascular_Malformations(Capillary | Venous | Lymphatic | Arterial | AVM | Combined)"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Before ISSVA, vascular birthmarks were confusingly called 'hemangiomas' regardless of type. ISSVA clarified that TRUE hemangiomas are tumors that grow rapidly then shrink - completely different from malformations that are abnormal vessels present at birth that never go away and grow with the child.",
      "key_insight": "The fundamental distinction between TUMORS (proliferative, may involute) and MALFORMATIONS (structural errors, never involute) guides all therapy. Infantile hemangiomas may be observed or treated with propranolol; vascular malformations require procedural intervention if symptomatic. This classification revolutionized management.",
      "technical_details": "ISSVA 2018 Classification: (1) Vascular Tumors - benign (infantile hemangioma, congenital hemangioma, tufted angioma), locally aggressive (kaposiform hemangioendothelioma), malignant (angiosarcoma). (2) Vascular Malformations - simple (capillary CM, lymphatic LM, venous VM, arteriovenous AVM, arteriovenous fistula AVF), combined (CVM, LVM, CLVM, CAVM, etc.), major named vessels, associated with other anomalies. Flow classification: low-flow (CM, LM, VM) vs high-flow (AVM, AVF). Genetic mutations increasingly identified: PIK3CA (CLOVES, LM, VM), GNAQ (CM), MAP2K1 (AVM). This classification determines imaging approach, treatment modality, and prognosis."
