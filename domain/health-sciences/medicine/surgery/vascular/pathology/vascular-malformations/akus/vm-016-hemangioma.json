      "text": "Infantile hemangioma is the most common vascular tumor of infancy, characterized by GLUT-1 positivity, a predictable growth phase (0-12 months) followed by spontaneous involution (1-10 years), and excellent response to oral propranolol when treatment is indicated for functional impairment or cosmetic disfigurement.",
      "formal": "Infantile_Hemangioma = GLUT1_Positive + Proliferation(0-12mo) + Involution(1-10yr) + Propranolol_Responsive"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Infantile hemangiomas are like temporary tumors - they grow rapidly in the first year as blood vessels multiply, then slowly shrink over years as those vessels die off. Most resolve with just a minor mark left behind. Before propranolol, we watched and waited; now we can accelerate shrinkage when needed.",
      "key_insight": "The accidental discovery that propranolol shrinks hemangiomas transformed management. Previously, steroids or surgery were used for problematic lesions. Now, propranolol is first-line for high-risk hemangiomas (periocular, airway, facial, ulcerated). It works by multiple mechanisms including vasoconstriction, apoptosis, and anti-angiogenesis.",
      "technical_details": "Infantile hemangioma affects 4-5% of infants, higher in premature and females (3:1). Pathogenesis involves placental theory - hemangioma cells express placental markers. GLUT-1 (glucose transporter-1) positivity is diagnostic, distinguishing from congenital hemangiomas and vascular malformations. Phases: precursor lesion (pale spot, telangiectasias) → proliferation (0-9 months, rapid growth) → plateau → involution (1-10 years). High-risk features: periocular (amblyopia), nasal tip (cartilage damage), lip (feeding difficulty), airway (PHACE), large facial (PHACE evaluation), ulceration. Propranolol: 1-3 mg/kg/day divided BID-TID, start at 1 mg/kg and increase, monitor HR/BP/glucose, treat 6-12 months minimum."
