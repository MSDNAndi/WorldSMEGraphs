    "statement": {
      "text": "Arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are high-flow vascular anomalies characterized by direct arteriovenous shunting without an intervening capillary bed (nidus), progressing through Schobinger stages from quiescence to decompensation, requiring complete nidus elimination through combined embolization and resection for cure.",
      "formal": "AVM = High_Flow + AV_Shunt_Without_Capillary_Bed + Nidus + Schobinger_Staging + Requires_Complete_Nidus_Elimination"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "AVMs are like direct shortcuts between arteries and veins that shouldn't exist. Blood flows too fast through these abnormal connections (the nidus) instead of going through normal capillaries. They often seem stable for years, then suddenly enlarge and cause problems after puberty, pregnancy, or trauma.",
      "key_insight": "The nidus is the key - partial treatment makes AVMs worse by stimulating angiogenesis. Embolization alone without resection leads to recurrence. The goal must be complete nidus elimination, which usually requires combined embolization followed by surgical resection. Some AVMs are unresectable and require palliative management.",
      "technical_details": "AVMs are present at birth but may not be evident until triggered by puberty, pregnancy, trauma, or incomplete treatment. Pathophysiology: arteriovenous shunting causes venous arterialization, tissue ischemia from arterial steal, and high-output cardiac state if large. Schobinger staging: I (quiescence - warmth, pink-blue, AV shunting on Doppler), II (expansion - pulsation, thrill, bruit, tortuous veins), III (destruction - pain, ulceration, bleeding, steal phenomena), IV (decompensation - high-output cardiac failure). Imaging: Doppler shows high-velocity low-resistance flow; MRI/MRA for extent; angiography for treatment planning. Treatment: embolization (ethanol, Onyx, coils) to devascularize, followed by surgical resection within 24-72 hours while nidus still devascularized. Proximal ligation is CONTRAINDICATED - stimulates collateral recruitment."
