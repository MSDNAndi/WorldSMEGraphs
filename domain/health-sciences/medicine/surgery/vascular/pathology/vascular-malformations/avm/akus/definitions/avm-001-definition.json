    "statement": {
      "text": "Arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are congenital high-flow vascular lesions consisting of abnormal direct connections between arteries and veins without an intervening capillary bed. The central 'nidus' is the core of abnormal vessels. AVMs are distinguished from hemangiomas (tumors) by their presence at birth, growth proportional to the body, lack of involution, and absence of cellular proliferation.",
      "formal": "AVM: Congenital high-flow lesion; Direct artery-vein connection (no capillary bed); Nidus = core; ISSVA classification: High-flow malformation (not tumor)"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Think of the circulatory system as a river system where arteries are fast-flowing rivers, capillaries are irrigation channels that slow down water to nourish fields, and veins are collection channels. An AVM is like a shortcut tunnel directly connecting a fast river to the collection channels - the water rushes through without nourishing the fields, can cause flooding (swelling, bleeding), and may eventually damage both sides from the abnormal pressure.",
      "key_insight": "AVMs are present at birth but may not become clinically apparent until adolescence or adulthood when they enlarge due to hormonal changes, trauma, or intervention. Unlike hemangiomas, AVMs never involute spontaneously and typically progress through Schobinger stages if untreated.",
      "technical_details": "The ISSVA (International Society for the Study of Vascular Anomalies) classification distinguishes vascular tumors (hemangiomas) from vascular malformations (AVM, VM, LM, CM). AVMs are high-flow due to arterial inflow directly into veins. The nidus represents the epicenter of abnormal AV connections. Treatment must target the nidus - proximal ligation alone leads to recruitment of collaterals and recurrence."
