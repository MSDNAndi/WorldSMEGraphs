      "text": "Lymphedema is chronic tissue swelling caused by impaired lymphatic drainage, resulting in interstitial protein-rich fluid accumulation. It is classified as primary (developmental lymphatic abnormality) or secondary (acquired damage from surgery, radiation, infection, or malignancy). Secondary lymphedema is far more common, with breast cancer treatment being the leading cause in developed countries.",
      "formal": "Lymphedema: Chronic edema from lymphatic insufficiency; Primary (developmental) vs Secondary (acquired - surgery, radiation, infection); Protein-rich interstitial fluid → fibrosis"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "The lymphatic system is like the body's garbage collection service, removing fluid and proteins that leak out of blood vessels. When this system is damaged or blocked, fluid backs up in the tissues like a clogged drain. Unlike regular swelling (edema), which is mostly water, lymphedema fluid is protein-rich. Over time, these proteins trigger inflammation and scarring, causing the tissue to become permanently thickened and hardened.",
      "key_insight": "Lymphedema is a chronic, progressive condition without cure. Early diagnosis and treatment (before fibrosis develops) offers the best outcomes. The 'Stemmer sign' - inability to pinch a fold of skin at the base of the second toe - is a simple and highly specific clinical test.",
      "technical_details": "Lymphatic insufficiency leads to accumulation of protein-rich interstitial fluid. High protein concentration triggers chronic inflammation, fibroblast proliferation, and adipose deposition. This causes progressive tissue fibrosis and immune dysfunction (increased cellulitis risk). ISL staging: Stage 0 (latent), Stage I (pitting, reversible), Stage II (non-pitting, irreversible), Stage III (lymphostatic elephantiasis)."
