      "text": "Lymphedema praecox (Meige disease) is a primary lymphedema with onset typically around puberty (ages 1-35), more common in females, associated with hypoplastic lymphatics and sometimes linked to mutations in FOXC2 or GJC2 genes.",
      "formal": "Lymphedema_Praecox = Primary_Lymphedema + Onset_1_35_years + Hypoplastic_Lymphatics + Female_Predominance"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "While Milroy disease appears at birth, lymphedema praecox remains hidden until puberty or young adulthood when increased demands overwhelm marginally functional lymphatics. The hormonal and growth changes of puberty may trigger decompensation of a previously borderline lymphatic system.",
      "key_insight": "Lymphedema praecox is the most common form of primary lymphedema, accounting for 80% of cases. Unlike Milroy (absent lymphatics), most cases show hypoplastic (underdeveloped) rather than aplastic lymphatics. The lymphatics are present but insufficient to handle adult physiologic demands.",
      "technical_details": "Lymphedema praecox typically presents between ages 1-35 with 80% before age 35. Female:male ratio is 4:1, possibly due to hormonal effects on lymphatic function. Lymphoscintigraphy usually shows hypoplastic lymphatics with delayed transport rather than complete absence. When familial (Meige disease), inheritance is autosomal dominant with variable penetrance. FOXC2 mutations (lymphedema-distichiasis syndrome) and GJC2 mutations are identified in some familial cases. Unlike congenital forms, cellulitis is a significant risk factor due to impaired immune surveillance."
