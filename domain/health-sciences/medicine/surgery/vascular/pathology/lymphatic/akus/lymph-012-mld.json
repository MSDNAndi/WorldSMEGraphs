    "statement": {
      "text": "Manual lymph drainage (MLD) is a specialized gentle massage technique using light pressure and rhythmic movements to enhance lymphatic flow, redirect lymph to functioning pathways, and reduce edema in patients with lymphedema.",
      "formal": "MLD = Light_Pressure + Rhythmic_Movements + Proximal_to_Distal + Redirect_to_Functional_Pathways"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Think of MLD as gently pushing fluid through a network of tiny tubes. Unlike regular massage which pushes on muscles, MLD uses very light pressure to stretch the skin and stimulate the lymphatic vessels just beneath it. The key is moving fluid from congested areas toward areas that can still drain normally.",
      "key_insight": "MLD alone has limited evidence, but when combined with compression bandaging as part of Complete Decongestive Therapy (CDT), it is highly effective. The sequence is critical: always clear the trunk first to 'make room' for fluid from the limb."
