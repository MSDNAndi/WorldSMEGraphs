      "text": "Lymphedema tarda is primary lymphedema with onset after age 35, representing late decompensation of marginally functional lymphatics due to aging, obesity, or additional stressors, and requiring careful exclusion of secondary causes including malignancy.",

    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Some people are born with lymphatics that work well enough for decades but eventually fail with aging. Weight gain, reduced activity, or minor injuries can push a borderline system over the threshold. Unlike early-onset forms, we must carefully rule out cancer or other secondary causes.",
      "key_insight": "The key clinical challenge in lymphedema tarda is differentiating primary from secondary lymphedema. Late-onset edema mandates workup for malignancy, particularly when unilateral, rapidly progressive, or associated with systemic symptoms. Only after excluding secondary causes can primary lymphedema tarda be diagnosed.",
      "technical_details": "Lymphedema tarda accounts for approximately 10% of primary lymphedema cases. The pathophysiology involves progressive failure of marginally competent lymphatics with aging. Contributing factors include decreased lymphangion contractility, obesity increasing lymphatic load, reduced physical activity decreasing pump function, and venous disease compounding lymphatic insufficiency. Lymphoscintigraphy typically shows slow but present transport. The diagnosis is one of exclusion - CT or MRI to rule out obstructing masses is essential before attributing lymphedema to primary causes."
