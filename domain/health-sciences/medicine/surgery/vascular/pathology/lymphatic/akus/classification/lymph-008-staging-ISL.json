    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Think of lymphedema progressing from a hidden problem (Stage 0) to soft reversible swelling (Stage I) to permanent swelling with tissue changes (Stage II) to severe disfiguring swelling with skin overgrowth (Stage III). Early intervention at Stage I can prevent progression.",
      "key_insight": "Stage 0 (subclinical/latent) lymphedema is increasingly recognized as the critical intervention window. Patients are at risk but have no visible swelling - bioimpedance spectroscopy can detect subclinical changes allowing early intervention before progression.",
      "technical_details": "ISL staging is based on clinical assessment: Stage 0 - impaired lymph transport but no clinical edema, often unrecognized; Stage I - early accumulation of protein-rich fluid that subsides with limb elevation, may be pitting; Stage II - elevation alone rarely reduces swelling, tissue fibrosis develops, initially pitting then non-pitting as fibrosis progresses (IIa pitting, IIb non-pitting); Stage III - lymphostatic elephantiasis with trophic skin changes including papillomatosis, hyperkeratosis, and massive swelling. Treatment intensity escalates with stage."
