      "text": "Secondary lymphedema results from damage or obstruction of previously normal lymphatics, most commonly caused by cancer treatment (surgery, radiation, lymph node dissection), infection (filariasis worldwide, cellulitis in developed countries), or trauma, representing the vast majority of lymphedema cases globally.",
      "formal": "Secondary_Lymphedema = Acquired_Lymphatic_Damage + (Surgery | Radiation | Infection | Trauma | Malignancy)"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Unlike primary lymphedema where lymphatics form abnormally, secondary lymphedema starts with normal lymphatics that become damaged or blocked. The most common scenario in developed countries is after cancer treatment - removing lymph nodes or irradiating them destroys critical drainage pathways.",
      "key_insight": "Secondary lymphedema is far more common than primary lymphedema and is largely iatrogenic in developed countries. Breast cancer-related lymphedema affects 20-40% of patients after axillary lymph node dissection. Globally, filariasis causes over 120 million cases, making it the most common cause of lymphedema worldwide.",
      "technical_details": "Mechanisms of secondary lymphedema: (1) Surgical disruption - lymph node dissection removes drainage stations and severs collecting vessels; (2) Radiation fibrosis - damages lymphatic vessels and nodes, effects may be delayed years; (3) Tumor obstruction - direct invasion or compression of lymphatics; (4) Infection - filariasis causes lymphangitis and progressive fibrosis, recurrent cellulitis scars lymphatics; (5) Trauma - crush injuries, burns, or severe inflammation. Risk factors include extent of nodal dissection, radiation therapy, obesity, wound complications, and recurrent infections. Latency period can be months to decades after inciting event."
