      "text": "Compression therapy is the cornerstone of lymphedema management, utilizing short-stretch bandages during reduction phase and fitted compression garments for maintenance, applying external pressure to reduce edema, enhance lymphatic flow, and prevent refilling.",

    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Compression works like squeezing a sponge during activity - when muscles contract against the external bandage, pressure rises dramatically to push fluid out. At rest, pressure drops to allow comfort. This on-off pumping enhances lymphatic and venous return.",
      "key_insight": "Short-stretch bandages are preferred over long-stretch elastic bandages because they provide high 'working pressure' during muscle activity (when you want to push fluid) but low 'resting pressure' at rest (for comfort and to avoid arterial compromise).",
      "technical_details": "Short-stretch bandages have extensibility <100% (typically 40-70%) providing a semi-rigid shell. With muscle contraction, intra-compartmental pressure rises substantially against this inelastic material. Laplace's Law governs pressure: P = nT/CW (n=layers, T=tension, C=circumference, W=width). Graduated compression higher distally creates pressure gradient driving proximal flow. Working pressure with short-stretch: 60-80 mmHg during activity; resting pressure: 20-30 mmHg. Compression garments (Class II: 20-30 mmHg; Class III: 30-40 mmHg; Class IV: 40-50 mmHg) maintain reduction. Custom flat-knit garments for irregular shapes; circular-knit for regular contours."
