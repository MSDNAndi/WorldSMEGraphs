      "text": "Chylous ascites is the accumulation of lymphatic chyle in the peritoneal cavity, resulting from disruption or obstruction of intra-abdominal lymphatics or the cisterna chyli, most commonly caused by malignancy, surgery (especially aortic or retroperitoneal procedures), or cirrhosis with lymphatic hypertension.",

    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "When lymphatic channels draining the intestines are damaged or blocked, the milky fat-rich fluid leaks into the belly instead of reaching the bloodstream. This causes abdominal distension and progressive nutritional problems from losing fats, proteins, and immune cells.",
      "key_insight": "Chylous ascites differs from chylothorax in etiology - malignancy (especially lymphoma) is the leading cause in adults, followed by surgery. The cisterna chyli and major intestinal lymphatics are vulnerable during aortic, pancreatic, and retroperitoneal surgery.",
      "technical_details": "Ascitic fluid analysis shows triglycerides >200 mg/dL (some use >110 mg/dL), milky appearance, cholesterol:TG ratio <1, and lymphocyte predominance. In children, chylous ascites is often congenital (lymphatic malformations); in adults, malignancy and surgery predominate. Aortic surgery risk is highest with retroperitoneal lymphadenectomy or extensive dissection near the cisterna chyli at L1-L2. Portal hypertension can cause secondary lymphatic overload. Management parallels chylothorax: dietary modification (MCT, NPO, TPN), octreotide, paracentesis/drainage, and surgical exploration or lymphangiography/embolization for refractory cases."
