      "text": "Complete Decongestive Therapy (CDT) is the gold standard treatment for lymphedema, consisting of two phases: an intensive reduction phase with manual lymphatic drainage (MLD), multilayer short-stretch bandaging, exercise, and skin care, followed by a maintenance phase with compression garments and self-management.",
      "formal": "CDT = Phase_1(MLD + Bandaging + Exercise + Skincare) → Phase_2(Compression_Garments + Self_MLD + Maintenance)"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "CDT works by manually pushing fluid out of the swollen limb toward working lymphatics, then preventing refill with compression. Phase 1 is intensive treatment by therapists to achieve maximum reduction; Phase 2 is lifelong maintenance by the patient to preserve gains.",
      "key_insight": "CDT achieves 40-60% volume reduction in compliant patients but requires lifelong maintenance. Success depends critically on patient adherence to Phase 2 - without maintenance compression, all gains are lost within months.",
      "technical_details": "Phase 1 (Intensive Reduction): Duration 2-4 weeks with daily sessions. MLD uses light pressure (30-40 mmHg) in specific sequences to redirect lymph through collateral pathways. Multilayer bandaging with short-stretch bandages provides high working pressure, low resting pressure. Exercises performed in bandages to enhance muscle pump. Meticulous skin care prevents cellulitis. Phase 2 (Maintenance): Fitted compression garments (Class II-III, 20-40 mmHg), self-MLD, continued exercise, skin hygiene. Night compression for severe cases. Contraindications include active cellulitis, DVT, decompensated CHF, and arterial insufficiency."
