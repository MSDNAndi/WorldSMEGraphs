    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Every day, about 20 liters of fluid filters out of blood capillaries into tissues. Most returns directly to venules, but 2-4 liters containing proteins too large to enter venules must return via lymphatics. The lymphatic system is the only route home for these escaped proteins.",
      "key_insight": "Lymphatic failure causes protein accumulation in tissues (not just water), leading to progressive fibrosis and tissue changes that distinguish lymphedema from other forms of edema. The high protein content activates inflammation and fibroblasts, creating a self-perpetuating cycle.",
      "technical_details": "Starling forces govern initial lymph formation: capillary filtration exceeds reabsorption by ~4L/day. Interstitial fluid enters initial lymphatics through pressure-dependent opening of inter-endothelial junctions. Collecting lymphatics generate propulsive force through smooth muscle contraction in lymphangions (segments between valves), contracting 1-4 times/minute, generating pressures of 30-60 mmHg. Flow is augmented by skeletal muscle contraction (extrinsic pump), respiratory diaphragm movement, and arterial pulsation. Neural (sympathetic) and humoral (NO, prostaglandins) factors modulate contractility. Safety factor: lymph flow can increase 10-50 fold before edema develops.",
      "common_misconceptions": [
        "Misconception: Lymph flow is passive. Reality: Lymphangions are active contractile units with intrinsic pacemaker activity.",
        "Misconception: Lymphedema is just excess water. Reality: It is protein-rich fluid; the high oncotic pressure and protein accumulation drive fibrosis.",
        "Misconception: Diuretics help lymphedema. Reality: They remove water but concentrate proteins, potentially worsening tissue fibrosis."
