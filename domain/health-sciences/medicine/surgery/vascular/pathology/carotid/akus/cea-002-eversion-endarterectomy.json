      "text": "Eversion carotid endarterectomy is a technique where the internal carotid artery is transected at its origin and everted to remove plaque, offering advantages of shorter clamp time, no patch requirement, and natural ICA shortening.",
      "formal": "Technique: Transect ICA at origin, evert media/adventitia over plaque; Advantages: No patch needed, shorter clamp time, corrects ICA redundancy; Patency: Equivalent to conventional CEA with patch"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Instead of opening the artery lengthwise like a hotdog bun, eversion technique is like peeling a banana inside-out - the artery is cut off, turned inside-out to remove plaque, then reconnected.",
      "key_insight": "Eversion endarterectomy corrects ICA redundancy while avoiding the need for patch material.",
      "technical_details": "Eversion carotid endarterectomy involves transecting the internal carotid artery at its origin from the bulb. The adventitia and media are then everted (turned inside-out) over the atheromatous core, which is removed in a circumferential fashion. The ICA is then reimplanted to the CCA. This technique offers shorter clamp times, eliminates need for patch angioplasty, and simultaneously corrects ICA kinking or redundancy. Outcomes are equivalent to conventional CEA with patch in experienced hands.",
