    "statement": {
      "text": "Cerebral hyperperfusion syndrome (CHS) is a rare but devastating complication of carotid revascularization characterized by unilateral headache, seizures, and potentially intracerebral hemorrhage due to sudden increase in cerebral blood flow to a chronically hypoperfused hemisphere.",
      "formal": "Incidence: 1-3% post-CEA/CAS; Triad: Ipsilateral headache, seizures, focal deficits; Risk: Severe stenosis, poor collaterals, hypertension; Prevention: Strict BP control"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "After years of living with reduced blood flow, the brain's blood vessels lose their ability to constrict. When we suddenly restore full blood flow, these 'lazy' vessels can't tighten up, and too much blood floods into the brain tissue, causing swelling or bleeding.",
      "key_insight": "Strict blood pressure control post-CEA is the cornerstone of CHS prevention - even 'normal' pressures can be dangerously high for a hypoperfused brain.",
      "technical_details": "Cerebral hyperperfusion syndrome results from impaired cerebral autoregulation in chronically hypoperfused brain. After revascularization, cerebral blood flow can increase 2-3 fold. With defective autoregulation, small arterioles cannot constrict, leading to capillary leak, cerebral edema, and potentially hemorrhagic stroke. Risk factors include severe stenosis (>90%), contralateral occlusion, recent stroke, and perioperative hypertension. The classic triad is ipsilateral headache, seizures, and focal neurologic deficits. Treatment focuses on aggressive blood pressure control.",
      "common_misconceptions": [
        "CHS only occurs in the first 24 hours - FALSE, can occur up to 2 weeks post-op",
        "Normal blood pressure is safe post-CEA - FALSE, may need lower than usual BP targets",
        "CHS is just a headache - FALSE, can progress to fatal intracerebral hemorrhage",
