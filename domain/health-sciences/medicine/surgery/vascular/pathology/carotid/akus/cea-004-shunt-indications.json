    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "When we clamp the carotid artery during surgery, blood flow to the brain temporarily stops on that side. A shunt is a temporary bypass tube that keeps blood flowing while we work on the artery.",

      "technical_details": "Carotid shunting involves placing a temporary conduit (Javid, Pruitt-Inahara, Sundt, or other) to maintain cerebral perfusion during the endarterectomy. Three philosophies exist: (1) Routine shunting - all patients, (2) Selective shunting - based on monitoring (EEG, stump pressure, TCD, or awake testing), (3) Never shunting - expeditious surgery without shunt. Each approach has proponents, and no randomized trial demonstrates clear superiority. Most surgeons use selective shunting based on monitoring.",
