    "statement": {
      "text": "Carotid stenosis is classified as symptomatic if the patient has had a TIA, amaurosis fugax, or non-disabling stroke referable to that carotid territory within the past 6 months. The distinction is critical because symptomatic stenosis has a much higher stroke risk (13% at 2 years for 70-99%) and derives greater benefit from intervention than asymptomatic stenosis (2-5%/year risk).",
      "formal": "Symptomatic: TIA/stroke/amaurosis in past 6 months | Stroke risk: 13% at 2 years (70-99% stenosis) | NNT to prevent stroke: ~6 | Asymptomatic: No symptoms | Stroke risk: 2-5%/year | NNT to prevent stroke: ~17-20"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Think of a carotid plaque as a volcano. An asymptomatic plaque is a dormant volcano - dangerous in theory but sitting quietly. A symptomatic plaque is a volcano that just erupted (TIA or stroke) and is actively throwing off debris. The recently active volcano is much more likely to erupt again, which is why we're more aggressive about treating symptomatic disease.",
      "key_insight": "The term 'symptomatic' has a very specific meaning - it's not about symptoms from the stenosis itself (there are none), but about recent neurologic events attributable to that carotid. A patient with 80% carotid stenosis who has never had a TIA or stroke is 'asymptomatic' even though they have severe disease. Timing matters too - symptoms >6 months ago are generally considered 'old' and the patient reverts to asymptomatic risk category.",
      "technical_details": "Symptomatic events must be referable to the carotid territory: (1) TIA - transient focal weakness, numbness, speech difficulty, or vision loss lasting <24 hours; (2) Stroke - persistent focal deficit; (3) Amaurosis fugax - transient monocular vision loss (retinal ischemia). Stroke risk in symptomatic 70-99% stenosis: 13% at 2 years (NASCET). Stroke risk in asymptomatic 60-99% stenosis: 2-3%/year (ACAS, ACST). NNT for symptomatic: ~6 to prevent 1 stroke over 5 years. NNT for asymptomatic: ~17-20 to prevent 1 stroke over 5 years.",
      "common_misconceptions": [
        "Any symptom makes it 'symptomatic' - must be focal neurologic event in that carotid territory",
        "Dizziness is a carotid symptom - dizziness is usually from posterior circulation or non-vascular causes",
        "Symptoms years ago still count - symptoms >6 months ago = asymptomatic for treatment planning",
        "Asymptomatic means low risk - still 2-5%/year, just lower than symptomatic"
