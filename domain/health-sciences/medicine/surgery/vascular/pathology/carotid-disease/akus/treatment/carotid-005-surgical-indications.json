      "text": "Carotid revascularization is indicated for symptomatic stenosis ≥50% (TIA or stroke within 6 months) with perioperative risk <6%, and for asymptomatic stenosis ≥60-70% with perioperative risk <3% and life expectancy >5 years. Benefit is time-sensitive - early intervention (within 2 weeks) for symptomatic stenosis provides greatest stroke reduction.",
      "formal": "Symptomatic: ≥50% stenosis + TIA/stroke <6mo + periop risk <6%; Asymptomatic: ≥60-70% + periop risk <3% + life expectancy >5yr; Timing: Early (within 2 weeks) for symptomatic"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "The decision to operate on carotid stenosis is a numbers game. We're comparing the risk of stroke from the plaque (higher with more stenosis and symptoms) against the risk of the surgery itself. For someone who just had a TIA, their untreated stroke risk is very high, so even a moderate surgical risk is worth it. For someone with no symptoms, the baseline stroke risk is lower, so we only intervene if surgical risk is very low.",
      "key_insight": "Timing matters enormously for symptomatic stenosis. The stroke risk is highest in the first 2 weeks after TIA/minor stroke - this is when intervention provides the most benefit. Delaying surgery beyond 2 weeks significantly diminishes the number needed to treat.",
      "technical_details": "NASCET showed 17% absolute risk reduction with CEA for symptomatic 70-99% stenosis (NNT=6). ACAS showed 5.9% absolute risk reduction over 5 years for asymptomatic ≥60% stenosis (NNT=17). Modern medical therapy (statins, antiplatelet) has improved, potentially reducing benefit of asymptomatic intervention - CREST-2 trial addressing this. Perioperative stroke/death rate is the key quality metric."
