    "statement": {
      "text": "Carotid artery disease is atherosclerotic narrowing of the extracranial carotid arteries, predominantly at the carotid bifurcation. It is responsible for 10-20% of ischemic strokes and is classified as symptomatic (causing TIA or stroke within 6 months) or asymptomatic. Intervention thresholds differ: ≥50% stenosis for symptomatic, ≥60-70% for asymptomatic patients.",
      "formal": "Carotid Stenosis: Atherosclerotic plaque at carotid bifurcation → Luminal narrowing → Embolic or hemodynamic stroke | Symptomatic: TIA/stroke within 6 months, intervene at ≥50% | Asymptomatic: No recent symptoms, intervene at ≥60-70%"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "The carotid arteries are the 'highways' carrying blood to your brain. Where they split (bifurcation), turbulent blood flow promotes cholesterol plaque formation. This plaque can cause stroke in two ways: (1) pieces break off and travel to the brain (embolic), or (2) severe narrowing reduces blood flow (hemodynamic, less common). The key clinical question is whether the plaque has recently caused symptoms - symptomatic plaques are 'unstable' and pose much higher stroke risk than asymptomatic ones.",
      "key_insight": "The distinction between symptomatic and asymptomatic is critical because it determines benefit from intervention. Symptomatic 70-99% stenosis has ~20% annual stroke risk - intervention dramatically reduces this. Asymptomatic stenosis has only 1-2% annual stroke risk even without intervention, so the benefit of surgery must outweigh the 2-3% procedural risk.",
      "technical_details": "Stenosis is measured using NASCET criteria: (1 - [narrowest diameter / normal distal ICA diameter]) × 100. ECST criteria use the estimated original bulb diameter, giving higher percentages for the same lesion. NASCET is the North American standard. Plaque characteristics matter: echolucent, irregular, ulcerated plaques are higher risk than calcified, smooth plaques. Tandem lesions (additional intracranial stenosis) reduce intervention benefit. Contralateral occlusion increases both stroke risk and procedural risk.",
      "common_misconceptions": [
        "All carotid stenosis needs surgery - asymptomatic stenosis benefit is marginal with modern medical therapy",
        "Percentage stenosis is everything - plaque morphology and symptoms matter equally",
        "TIA is minor - it's a warning stroke, and urgent intervention reduces subsequent stroke risk by 80%",
        "Carotid disease only causes stroke - it can also cause retinal ischemia (amaurosis fugax)"
