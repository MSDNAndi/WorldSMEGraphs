      "text": "Carotid plaque morphology significantly impacts stroke risk beyond stenosis degree. Vulnerable (high-risk) features include intraplaque hemorrhage, large lipid-rich necrotic core (LRNC), thin or ruptured fibrous cap, and surface ulceration. Advanced imaging (MRI, contrast-enhanced ultrasound) can identify these features and may guide treatment in moderate stenosis.",
      "formal": "Vulnerable Carotid Plaque: Intraplaque hemorrhage, LRNC >40% volume, thin/ruptured cap, ulceration; Associated with embolic events; May lower intervention threshold in moderate stenosis"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Think of carotid plaque like a volcano. A stable plaque is like a dormant volcano with a thick cap - unlikely to erupt. A vulnerable plaque is like an active volcano with a thin crust over boiling magma (lipid core) and internal bleeding (intraplaque hemorrhage) - at any moment it can rupture, sending debris (emboli) downstream to block brain arteries and cause stroke.",
      "key_insight": "Stenosis degree alone doesn't capture stroke risk. Two plaques with 70% stenosis can have vastly different stroke risk depending on morphology. Current guidelines focus on stenosis percentage, but plaque characteristics are increasingly recognized as important, especially for moderate stenosis where intervention benefit is less clear.",
      "technical_details": "Intraplaque hemorrhage (IPH) results from neovascularization of the plaque with subsequent leaky, fragile vessels bleeding into the lipid core. IPH accelerates plaque progression and strongly predicts future stroke (HR 4-7x). The fibrous cap separates the thrombogenic LRNC from flowing blood - a thin (<65 μm) or ruptured cap exposes the core, triggering thrombosis and embolization."
