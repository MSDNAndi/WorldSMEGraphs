    "definition": "Carotid artery dissection is a tear in the intima or media of the internal or common carotid artery, allowing blood to enter the vessel wall and form an intramural hematoma. This can cause luminal stenosis or occlusion and serves as a nidus for thrombus formation and distal embolization. Important cause of stroke in young adults.",
