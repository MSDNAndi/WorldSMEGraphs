    "title": "Eversion Carotid Endarterectomy",
    "description": "A technique for carotid endarterectomy where the internal carotid artery is transected, everted, and the plaque removed by everting the arterial wall inside-out.",
    "definition": "Eversion CEA involves transecting the ICA at its origin, everting the artery like removing a sock, performing endarterectomy of the everted vessel, then reimplanting the ICA to the CCA. Advantages include no patch requirement, shorter clamp time, and ability to correct redundancy/kinking.",
    "clinical_features": {
      "technique_steps": [
        "Transect ICA at bulb origin obliquely",
        "Evert ICA over dissector or forceps",
        "Remove plaque as cylinder as artery everts",
        "Ensure clean endpoint distally",
        "Endarterectomize ECA and CCA separately",
        "Reimplant ICA to CCA (may shorten for redundancy)"
      ],
      "advantages": [
        "No patch material required (reduced infection risk)",
        "Shorter clamp time typically",
        "Naturally addresses ICA redundancy/kinking",
        "Avoids suture line at critical bifurcation",
        "Reduced material cost"
      ],
      "disadvantages": [
        "Technically more demanding",
        "Limited visualization of distal endpoint",
        "May be difficult with high ICA lesions",
        "Not ideal for very calcified plaque",
        "Learning curve steeper than conventional"
      ],
      "outcomes": [
        "Perioperative stroke/death rates equivalent to conventional CEA",
        "Possibly lower restenosis rates (no patch narrowing)",
        "Shorter operative time in experienced hands",
        "Lower patch-related complications"
