    "definition": "Recurrent carotid stenosis is narrowing at a previously treated carotid site. Early recurrence (<2 years) is typically due to myointimal hyperplasia (smooth, low embolization risk), while late recurrence (>2 years) represents new atherosclerosis (higher stroke risk). Management depends on symptom status and timing of recurrence.",
