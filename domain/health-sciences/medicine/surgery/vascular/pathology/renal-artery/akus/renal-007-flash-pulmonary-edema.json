    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "When both kidneys think blood pressure is low (because of stenosis), they hold onto fluid and sodium. The body then has too much fluid but nowhere to put it - so it floods into the lungs suddenly, causing flash pulmonary edema.",
      "key_insight": "Flash pulmonary edema is one of the few clear indications for renal artery revascularization. Unlike hypertension or renal function decline, flash pulmonary edema reliably improves with successful renal artery stenting or surgery.",
      "technical_details": "Mechanism: bilateral RAS (or unilateral to solitary kidney) → activation of both renin-angiotensin-aldosterone systems → sodium/water retention → impaired natriuresis → acute volume overload → pulmonary edema. Presentation: recurrent sudden pulmonary edema without clear cardiac trigger, often with uncontrolled hypertension. Diagnosis: renal artery duplex, CTA, MRA. Treatment: renal artery stenting or surgical revascularization. Outcome: 70-80% resolution of flash pulmonary edema with successful revascularization."
