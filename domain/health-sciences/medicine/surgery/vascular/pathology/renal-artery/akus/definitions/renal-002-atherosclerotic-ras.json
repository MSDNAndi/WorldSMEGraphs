    "statement": {
      "text": "Atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis (ARAS) is the most common cause of renovascular disease (90%), characterized by ostial or proximal renal artery narrowing from aortic atherosclerotic plaque extension, causing renovascular hypertension and/or ischemic nephropathy in susceptible patients.",
      "formal": "ARAS = Atherosclerotic_Stenosis + (Renovascular_HTN | Ischemic_Nephropathy) + Risk_Factors(Age, HTN, DM, Smoking)"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Atherosclerotic plaques that form in the aorta can extend into the origins of the renal arteries, reducing blood flow to the kidneys. The kidneys respond by activating hormones (renin-angiotensin system) to raise blood pressure, and if severe, the kidney tissue itself begins to fail from chronic ischemia.",
      "key_insight": "The controversy in ARAS treatment stems from randomized trials (CORAL, ASTRAL) showing no benefit of stenting over medical therapy for most patients. However, highly selected patients (flash pulmonary edema, resistant hypertension, progressive renal failure) may benefit from revascularization.",
      "technical_details": "ARAS accounts for 90% of renovascular disease, predominantly affecting patients >50 years with cardiovascular risk factors. Lesions are typically ostial (within 5mm of aorta) or proximal, reflecting aortic plaque extension. Hemodynamically significant stenosis (>60-70%) activates the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system: reduced renal perfusion → renin release → angiotensin II → vasoconstriction and aldosterone release → hypertension and sodium retention. Bilateral disease or stenosis to a solitary kidney causes ischemic nephropathy. Duplex criteria: peak systolic velocity >200 cm/s, renal:aortic ratio >3.5. CTA or MRA for anatomic definition. Medical therapy (ACEi/ARB, statins, antiplatelet) is first-line; stenting reserved for specific clinical syndromes."
