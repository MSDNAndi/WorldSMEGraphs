      "text": "Fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) of the renal artery is a non-atherosclerotic, non-inflammatory arteriopathy affecting young to middle-aged women, characterized by alternating stenoses and dilations producing a 'string of beads' appearance on angiography, and typically responding well to angioplasty alone without stenting.",
      "formal": "Renal_FMD = Non_Atherosclerotic + Female_Predominance + String_of_Beads + Responds_to_Angioplasty"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "FMD is a disease of the arterial wall itself, not plaque buildup. The arterial wall develops abnormal thickenings that alternate with thin, dilated areas, creating a beaded appearance. Unlike atherosclerosis, simple balloon angioplasty works well because there's no plaque to recoil.",
      "key_insight": "FMD is the curable cause of hypertension in young patients. Unlike atherosclerotic RAS, renal FMD often produces dramatic blood pressure improvement with angioplasty, and stenting is usually unnecessary because the vessel wall is intrinsically normal between lesions.",
      "technical_details": "FMD accounts for ~10% of renovascular hypertension but is the most common cause in patients <40 years. Female:male ratio is 9:1. Medial fibroplasia (90%) produces the classic 'string of beads' with beads larger than the normal arterial diameter (differentiating from intimal fibroplasia where beads are smaller). Lesions typically involve the mid-to-distal renal artery and branch vessels, sparing the ostium (opposite of atherosclerosis). Bilateral in 60%. Associated findings: intracranial aneurysms (7-15%), carotid FMD (65%), coronary FMD. Treatment: angioplasty alone (no stent) achieves >90% technical success with 50-70% hypertension cure/improvement. Screen for FMD in other vascular beds."
