      "text": "Flash pulmonary edema (Pickering syndrome) is the sudden onset of severe pulmonary edema in patients with bilateral renal artery stenosis or stenosis to a solitary kidney, characterized by rapid volume overload without primary cardiac dysfunction, and representing the strongest indication for renal artery revascularization.",
      "formal": "Flash_Pulmonary_Edema = Sudden_Pulmonary_Edema + (Bilateral_RAS | Solitary_Kidney_RAS) + Preserved_EF + Responds_to_Revascularization"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "When both kidneys sense reduced blood flow due to stenosis, they activate the renin-angiotensin system aggressively, causing severe sodium and water retention plus vasoconstriction. The result is sudden, dramatic fluid overload that floods the lungs - not from a weak heart, but from too much volume.",
      "key_insight": "Flash pulmonary edema is the one scenario where renal artery revascularization shows clear benefit. Unlike other indications where the CORAL trial showed equivalence, flash pulmonary edema often resolves dramatically after stenting. The key is recognizing it.",
      "technical_details": "Pathophysiology: bilateral RAS or solitary kidney stenosis → impaired pressure natriuresis → sodium and water retention → volume expansion → LV end-diastolic pressure elevation → pulmonary edema. Activation of the renin-angiotensin system causes vasoconstriction and further pressure increase. Key features: recurrent episodes of sudden dyspnea, preserved ejection fraction (EF >40%), often presents at night or with exertion, rapid resolution with diuresis but recurrence. Diagnosis: clinical suspicion paramount, duplex or CTA to confirm bilateral RAS. Treatment: aggressive diuresis acutely, revascularization of hemodynamically significant lesions. Success rate for preventing recurrent episodes: 70-85%."
