    "title": "Ischemic Rest Pain",
    "definition": "Severe persistent pain in the foot and toes occurring at rest, typically at night, due to critically reduced arterial perfusion inadequate to meet basal metabolic demands. It represents Fontaine stage III and Rutherford category 4, and is a defining criterion for chronic limb-threatening ischemia (CLTI).",

      {
        "term": "Pathophysiology",
        "description": "Multi-level arterial occlusive disease reduces perfusion pressure below critical closing pressure of capillaries (~20-30 mmHg); at rest, cardiac output falls, and recumbent position eliminates gravity-assisted perfusion to feet"
      },
      {
        "term": "Nocturnal Pattern",
        "description": "Pain worsens at night when cardiac output decreases during sleep; patients characteristically hang foot off bed or sleep in chair to use gravity to improve perfusion - a classic board question scenario"

      {
        "term": "Location",
        "description": "Pain typically begins in forefoot/toes (most distal tissue), described as burning, aching, or severe cramping; may extend proximally with worsening ischemia"

      {
        "term": "Relief with Dependency",
        "description": "Patients learn to dangle legs or stand to use gravity to increase perfusion pressure (~100 mmHg per meter of height); this creates dependent rubor and may lead to dependent edema"

        "term": "Hemodynamic Threshold",
        "description": "Ankle pressure <50 mmHg or toe pressure <30 mmHg typically required to develop rest pain; corresponds to ABI <0.4 in most patients"

        "term": "Physical Findings",

      {
        "term": "Prognosis",
        "description": "Without revascularization, 1-year amputation rate 40-50%; 1-year mortality 25%. Represents urgency for intervention to prevent tissue loss and limb loss"

      {
        "term": "Differential Diagnosis",
