    "statement": {
      "text": "Thoracic aortic aneurysm (TAA) is a permanent, localized dilation of the thoracic aorta to ≥150% of normal diameter or absolute diameter ≥4.5-5.0 cm, depending on location. Unlike AAA which is predominantly atherosclerotic, TAA etiology varies by location: ascending aorta (genetic/degenerative), arch (atherosclerotic), and descending (atherosclerotic/traumatic).",
      "formal": "TAA: Thoracic aorta dilation ≥1.5x normal; By location: Aortic root/ascending (60%), Arch (10%), Descending (30%); Etiology varies by location (genetic, atherosclerotic, inflammatory)"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "The thoracic aorta is like a high-pressure pipe running from the heart through the chest. Different sections of this pipe are susceptible to different problems. Near the heart (ascending), genetic weaknesses in the wall structure are the main issue. Further down (descending), plaque buildup and high blood pressure cause damage similar to what happens in abdominal aneurysms.",
      "key_insight": "Ascending aortic aneurysms have different pathophysiology, natural history, and treatment than descending thoracic aneurysms. Ascending aneurysms are more commonly associated with connective tissue disorders and require open surgery. Descending aneurysms are more atherosclerotic and are increasingly treated with TEVAR.",
      "technical_details": "Normal thoracic aortic diameters vary by location: aortic root 3.0-3.5 cm, ascending 2.8-3.2 cm, arch 2.5-3.0 cm, descending 2.4-2.8 cm. Body surface area-indexed values more accurate. Ascending aneurysms associated with bicuspid aortic valve (50%), Marfan syndrome, Loeys-Dietz. Descending more atherosclerotic. Crawford classification for thoracoabdominal extent."
