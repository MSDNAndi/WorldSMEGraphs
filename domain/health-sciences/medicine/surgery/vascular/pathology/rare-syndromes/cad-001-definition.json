    "statement": {
      "text": "Cystic adventitial disease (CAD) is a rare non-atherosclerotic condition where mucin-containing cysts form in the adventitia of arteries, most commonly the popliteal artery. It typically affects young to middle-aged men without atherosclerotic risk factors, causing claudication that may have an acute or intermittent pattern depending on cyst volume.",
      "formal": "CAD: Adventitial mucinous cyst, 85% popliteal artery; Demographics: M>F (5:1), age 40-50; Presentation: claudication in young patient without risk factors; 'Scimitar sign' on angiography"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "CAD is like a blister forming on the outside of an artery. This fluid-filled sac can compress the artery from outside, blocking blood flow. Unlike atherosclerosis (deposits inside the artery), the problem is external compression. The claudication can be intermittent because the cyst can expand or decompress, causing symptoms to wax and wane.",
      "key_insight": "CAD should be suspected in any young patient with claudication and no atherosclerotic risk factors. MRI is the best imaging modality - it shows the characteristic cyst as a T2-hyperintense mass adjacent to the artery. Treatment should remove or drain the cyst rather than simply bypassing around it.",
      "technical_details": "Cysts contain mucoid gelatinous material. Theories of origin: (1) ganglionic - connection to adjacent joint synovium, (2) developmental - misplaced mucin-secreting cells, (3) repeated trauma. The popliteal artery is affected in 85% of cases, likely due to proximity to knee joint. May see 'scimitar sign' (curvilinear lucency) on angiography from extrinsic compression."
