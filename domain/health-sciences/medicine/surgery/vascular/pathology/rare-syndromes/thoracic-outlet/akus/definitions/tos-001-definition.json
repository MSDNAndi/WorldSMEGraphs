    "statement": {
      "text": "Thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS) encompasses compression of the brachial plexus, subclavian artery, or subclavian vein in the thoracic outlet (between clavicle and first rib). It is classified into neurogenic TOS (95%), venous TOS/Paget-Schroetter (3-5%), and arterial TOS (1-2%). Each type has distinct presentation, diagnosis, and treatment approaches.",
      "formal": "TOS Types: Neurogenic (95% - brachial plexus), Venous (3-5% - Paget-Schroetter, effort thrombosis), Arterial (1-2% - subclavian compression, aneurysm); All from thoracic outlet compression"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "The thoracic outlet is like a busy intersection where nerves, arteries, and veins all pass through a narrow space between the collarbone and first rib. If this space narrows (from an extra rib, tight muscles, or abnormal anatomy), structures get squeezed. Nerves are most sensitive to pressure (neurogenic TOS), but veins (Paget-Schroetter) and arteries can also be affected in more severe cases.",
      "key_insight": "The three types of TOS are distinct clinical entities requiring different approaches. Neurogenic TOS is common but controversial, often treated conservatively with physical therapy. Venous TOS presents acutely as arm DVT requiring thrombolysis and decompression. Arterial TOS is rare but serious, often presenting with distal embolization from subclavian aneurysm.",
      "technical_details": "Compression occurs in three spaces: interscalene triangle (between anterior and middle scalenes), costoclavicular space (between clavicle and first rib), and pectoralis minor space (under pectoralis minor tendon). Anatomic predispositions include cervical rib (0.5% population), elongated C7 transverse process, anomalous muscles, and previous clavicle fracture."
