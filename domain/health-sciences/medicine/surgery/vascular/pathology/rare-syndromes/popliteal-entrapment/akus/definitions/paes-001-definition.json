    "statement": {
      "text": "Popliteal artery entrapment syndrome (PAES) is compression of the popliteal artery by anomalous musculotendinous structures in the popliteal fossa, typically the medial head of gastrocnemius. It affects young, muscular individuals (often athletes) and can cause claudication, arterial damage (aneurysm, thrombosis), or acute ischemia if untreated.",
      "formal": "PAES: Popliteal artery compression by anomalous muscles (gastrocnemius); Demographics: young athletes; Complications: claudication → thrombosis/aneurysm → acute ischemia"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "PAES occurs when a muscle is in the wrong place, wrapping around or compressing the artery behind the knee. Every time the calf muscle contracts (like when walking or running), it squeezes the artery. Over time, this repeated trauma damages the artery wall, causing it to clot or form an aneurysm. It's like repeatedly stepping on a garden hose - eventually the hose gets damaged.",
      "key_insight": "PAES should be suspected in any young, athletic patient presenting with calf claudication without atherosclerotic risk factors. The diagnosis requires provocation testing (active plantar flexion or passive dorsiflexion) during imaging to demonstrate compression.",
      "technical_details": "Classic (anatomic) PAES involves developmental anomaly of the popliteal artery, gastrocnemius muscle, or popliteal vein. Functional PAES occurs with normal anatomy but hypertrophied gastrocnemius compressing normal artery. The Whelan classification (Types I-VI) describes the anatomic variants based on the relationship between the artery and medial head of gastrocnemius."
