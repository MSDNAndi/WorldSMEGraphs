    "statement": {
      "text": "Soft signs of vascular injury are clinical findings that suggest possible vascular injury but have a lower predictive value (20-30%) than hard signs. These include history of hemorrhage at the scene (now controlled), proximity of wound to major vessels, diminished but present pulses, small stable hematoma, peripheral nerve deficit, and unexplained hypotension. Soft signs warrant further imaging (CT angiography, conventional angiography, or duplex ultrasound) to clarify the diagnosis before determining the need for operative intervention.",
      "formal": "Soft Signs: Proximity injury, history of bleeding, diminished pulses, stable hematoma, nerve deficit, or ABI <0.9 → 20-30% probability of vascular injury → Imaging required to clarify diagnosis."
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "If hard signs are obvious warning lights, soft signs are subtle dashboard indicators that something might be wrong - they warrant investigation but don't necessarily mean immediate surgery. Just as a slightly low tire pressure light prompts you to check, but not to stop immediately, soft signs prompt imaging to determine if there's a real problem that needs surgical attention.",
      "key_insight": "The clinical value of soft signs lies in their ability to identify patients who need further workup. The 20-30% probability of injury is too high to ignore (unlike patients with no findings at all), but too low to justify taking every patient to the OR. Modern imaging, particularly CT angiography, has become the gold standard for evaluating soft signs, with sensitivity and specificity exceeding 95%.",
      "technical_details": "Soft signs are evaluated using a combination of physical examination and objective testing. The ankle-brachial index (ABI) is particularly useful: an ABI >0.9 essentially rules out significant arterial injury, while ABI <0.9 indicates need for further imaging. CTA has largely replaced conventional angiography for evaluation, offering rapid acquisition, excellent spatial resolution, and the ability to assess surrounding structures. Duplex ultrasound is useful for accessible vessels but limited in zones of injury with overlying hematoma."
