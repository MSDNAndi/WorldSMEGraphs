      "text": "Hard signs of vascular injury are physical examination findings that indicate a high probability (>90%) of significant arterial injury requiring surgical intervention. These signs include active pulsatile hemorrhage, expanding or pulsatile hematoma, absent distal pulses, and signs of limb ischemia (the 6 Ps: pain, pallor, pulselessness, paresthesias, paralysis, poikilothermia). The presence of any hard sign mandates immediate surgical exploration without the need for preoperative imaging, as delay to definitive repair increases limb loss and mortality.",
      "formal": "Hard Signs: Pulsatile hemorrhage, expanding hematoma, absent pulses, bruit/thrill, or limb ischemia (6 Ps) → >90% probability of major vascular injury → Immediate OR exploration."
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Hard signs are like obvious warning lights on a car dashboard - when you see them, you know something is seriously wrong and immediate action is required. Just as you wouldn't drive further with an engine fire light, you shouldn't delay surgery when hard signs of vascular injury are present. The diagnosis is clinical, and the treatment is operative.",
      "key_insight": "The clinical significance of hard signs is their extremely high positive predictive value (>90%). When present, the probability of major vascular injury is so high that preoperative imaging adds delay without changing management. In contrast, soft signs have a lower predictive value (20-30%) and warrant imaging to clarify the diagnosis before committing to surgery.",
      "technical_details": "Hard signs are categorized into hemorrhagic and ischemic types. Hemorrhagic hard signs (pulsatile bleeding, expanding hematoma) indicate arterial breach with ongoing blood loss. Ischemic hard signs (absent pulses, 6 Ps) indicate arterial occlusion with threatened limb viability. A bruit or thrill over the wound indicates arteriovenous communication. The presence of any single hard sign is sufficient to mandate exploration. Time to revascularization directly correlates with limb salvage rates, with the 6-hour 'golden period' representing the window before irreversible muscle and nerve damage occurs."
