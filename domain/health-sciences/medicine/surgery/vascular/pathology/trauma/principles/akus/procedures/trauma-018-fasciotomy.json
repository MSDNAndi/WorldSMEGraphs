    "statement": {
      "text": "Fasciotomy is a surgical procedure involving incision of the fascia to release elevated pressure within muscle compartments, preventing or treating compartment syndrome. In vascular surgery and trauma, fasciotomy is indicated prophylactically when prolonged ischemia (>4-6 hours) precedes revascularization, and therapeutically when compartment syndrome develops after reperfusion. The lower leg requires four-compartment release through two incisions (medial and lateral), while the forearm requires release of volar and dorsal compartments.",
      "formal": "Fasciotomy: Surgical release of fascial compartments to treat or prevent compartment syndrome. Indicated prophylactically with ischemia >4-6 hours, therapeutically with compartment pressures >30 mmHg or Δ <30 mmHg from diastolic pressure."
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Muscle compartments are like sealed containers - the fascia doesn't stretch. When blood flow is restored after prolonged ischemia, the muscles swell dramatically (reperfusion injury). If the container can't expand, pressure builds inside, crushing the muscles, nerves, and eventually cutting off blood flow again. Fasciotomy is like cutting open the container to allow the swelling tissue room to expand without self-destruction.",
      "key_insight": "The decision for prophylactic fasciotomy is time-based: if ischemia duration exceeds 4-6 hours of warm ischemia before revascularization, reperfusion edema is expected and prophylactic fasciotomy should be performed. Waiting for signs of compartment syndrome after revascularization risks irreversible muscle and nerve damage. The mantra is: 'When in doubt, cut it out.'",
      "technical_details": "Compartment pressure can be measured directly using a needle manometer or Stryker device. Absolute pressure >30 mmHg or delta pressure (diastolic BP minus compartment pressure) <30 mmHg indicates compartment syndrome. Lower leg has four compartments: anterior, lateral, superficial posterior, and deep posterior. The two-incision technique uses a lateral incision over the fibula (anterior and lateral compartments) and a medial incision 2cm posterior to the tibial border (superficial and deep posterior compartments). All four compartments must be released completely. Fasciotomy wounds are left open and managed with negative pressure wound therapy or wet dressings, with delayed primary closure or skin grafting at 3-7 days."
