    "statement": {
      "text": "The Mangled Extremity Severity Score (MESS) is a clinical tool designed to predict limb salvage potential after severe extremity trauma. The score incorporates four components: skeletal/soft tissue injury severity, limb ischemia, shock, and age. A MESS score ≥7 has been traditionally used to suggest that primary amputation may be more appropriate than limb salvage attempt, though this threshold remains controversial and should not be used as the sole determinant of amputation decisions.",
      "formal": "MESS = Skeletal/Soft Tissue (1-4) + Limb Ischemia (1-6, doubled if >6hr) + Shock (0-2) + Age (0-2). Score ≥7 suggests poor limb salvage prognosis, though clinical judgment remains paramount."
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "The MESS score is like a checklist that helps surgeons weigh multiple factors influencing whether a severely injured limb can be saved. Just as you might assess a damaged car by looking at the frame, engine, electrical system, and age before deciding repair vs. replacement, MESS looks at the bone/tissue damage, blood supply, overall body condition, and patient age to estimate the likelihood of successful limb salvage.",
      "key_insight": "The MESS score's value lies in providing a structured framework for documenting the severity of injury and guiding discussions with patients and families. However, it should not be used as an absolute threshold for amputation. The LEAP study demonstrated that no scoring system could reliably predict functional outcomes, and many limbs with MESS ≥7 have been successfully salvaged. The score is best used as one input into a shared decision-making process.",
      "technical_details": "The original MESS was validated in a retrospective study and later prospectively. Component scoring: Skeletal/soft tissue injury ranges from 1 (low energy) to 4 (massive contamination/crush). Limb ischemia assesses the presence and duration of pulse abnormalities, with scores doubled if ischemia duration exceeds 6 hours. Shock is graded based on blood pressure. Age adds points for patients over 50 or 70. The threshold of 7 was originally proposed as having 100% specificity for amputation, but subsequent studies have shown lower accuracy."
