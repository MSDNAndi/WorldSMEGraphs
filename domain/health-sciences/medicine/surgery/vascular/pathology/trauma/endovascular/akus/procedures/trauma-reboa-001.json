    "statement": {
      "text": "Resuscitative Endovascular Balloon Occlusion of the Aorta (REBOA) is a minimally invasive technique for temporary aortic occlusion in patients with life-threatening non-compressible torso hemorrhage. A balloon catheter inserted via the femoral artery is positioned in Zone 1 (descending thoracic aorta, for abdominal hemorrhage) or Zone 3 (infrarenal aorta, for pelvic hemorrhage) and inflated to occlude aortic flow, thereby reducing distal hemorrhage and augmenting central perfusion. REBOA serves as a bridge to definitive surgical or endovascular control, not as definitive treatment.",
      "formal": "REBOA: Femoral artery access → Balloon catheter to Zone 1 (T4-diaphragm) or Zone 3 (below renals) → Temporary aortic occlusion → Bridge to definitive hemorrhage control. Maximum occlusion time: 60-90 minutes (Zone 1) or longer (Zone 3)."
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Think of REBOA as temporarily pinching the main water pipe upstream of a leak. By stopping flow above the leak site, you reduce the flooding (bleeding) and maintain water pressure to the areas above (heart, brain). But you can't pinch the pipe forever - the areas below (kidneys, intestines, legs) are being deprived of water. REBOA buys time to fix the leak but must be followed quickly by definitive repair.",
      "key_insight": "REBOA occupies the niche between resuscitation and surgery for the crashing trauma patient. It provides the physiologic support of aortic cross-clamping without the need for emergent thoracotomy or laparotomy. However, it is a temporizing measure with significant ischemic consequences, and its role is to provide a bridge to definitive hemorrhage control, not to replace it.",
      "technical_details": "REBOA is inserted via common femoral artery access (typically 7-12 Fr sheath) using ultrasound or palpation guidance. The catheter is advanced to the appropriate zone based on suspected hemorrhage location. Zone 1 extends from the origin of the left subclavian artery to the celiac trunk (for abdominal hemorrhage); Zone 2 is the paravisceral segment (avoided); Zone 3 extends from the lowest renal artery to the aortic bifurcation (for pelvic hemorrhage). External landmarks estimate catheter length. Balloon inflation provides immediate hemodynamic support, but continuous occlusion causes distal ischemia. Partial REBOA (intermittent or partial inflation) may extend safe occlusion time."
