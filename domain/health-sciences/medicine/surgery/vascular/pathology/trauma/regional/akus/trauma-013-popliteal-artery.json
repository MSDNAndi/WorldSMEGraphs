      "text": "Popliteal artery injury, most commonly associated with knee dislocation or fractures involving the distal femur or proximal tibia, carries the highest amputation rate of any extremity arterial injury (10-15%) due to limited collateral circulation and the time-critical nature of revascularization.",
      "formal": "Popliteal_Injury = Knee_Dislocation_or_Fracture + High_Amputation_Risk + Limited_Collaterals + Time_Critical_Repair"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "The popliteal artery is tethered behind the knee, passing through a tight space where it can't move out of the way. When the knee dislocates or a severe fracture occurs, the artery gets stretched or torn. Because there are few good backup blood vessels around the knee, the leg below can die quickly without repair.",
      "key_insight": "Knee dislocation = popliteal artery injury until proven otherwise. Even when the knee has spontaneously reduced, 20-40% have arterial injury. The '6-hour rule' for limb salvage is well-established - delays beyond 6-8 hours of warm ischemia dramatically increase amputation rates. Immediate vascular surgery consultation is mandatory.",
      "technical_details": "The popliteal artery is the continuation of the superficial femoral artery at the adductor hiatus, running through the popliteal fossa and trifurcating into anterior tibial, posterior tibial, and peroneal arteries. It is relatively fixed at the adductor hiatus above and the soleus arch below, making it vulnerable to stretch injury. Knee dislocation (especially anterior and posterior) has 20-40% arterial injury rate. Collateral circulation via geniculate arteries is usually inadequate for acute occlusion. The golden rule: warm ischemia time <6 hours for optimal limb salvage. Management algorithm: ABC, assess pulses/ABI, CTA if ABI abnormal or high suspicion, immediate exploration for hard signs. Repair with reversed saphenous vein graft preferred. Four-compartment fasciotomy mandatory if ischemia >4-6 hours or significant swelling."
