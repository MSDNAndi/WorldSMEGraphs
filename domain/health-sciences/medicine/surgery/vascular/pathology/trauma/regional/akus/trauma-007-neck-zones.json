    "statement": {
      "text": "The neck is divided into three anatomic zones (I, II, III) for penetrating trauma management, with Zone I (clavicle to cricoid) and Zone III (angle of mandible to skull base) traditionally requiring preoperative imaging due to difficult surgical access, while Zone II (cricoid to mandible angle) is readily accessible for direct surgical exploration.",
      "formal": "Neck_Zones: Zone_I (Clavicle→Cricoid) + Zone_II (Cricoid→Mandible_Angle) + Zone_III (Mandible_Angle→Skull_Base)"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "The neck is divided into three horizontal zones like a traffic light. Zone II in the middle (green) is surgically accessible - you can directly explore injuries. Zones I (bottom, at chest entrance) and III (top, near skull base) are 'red' - they're hard to reach surgically, so you need to know exactly what's injured before operating.",
      "key_insight": "Modern management has shifted from mandatory exploration of Zone II injuries to selective management based on CT angiography for all zones in stable patients. CTA has revolutionized penetrating neck trauma management by identifying injuries precisely, reducing negative explorations, and enabling endovascular treatment options.",
      "technical_details": "Zone I (thoracic inlet to cricoid): contains subclavian and proximal common carotid arteries, vertebral artery origin, trachea, esophagus, lung apex, thoracic duct. Zone II (cricoid to angle of mandible): common carotid, internal/external carotid bifurcation, internal jugular vein, larynx, pharynx, esophagus. Zone III (mandible angle to skull base): distal internal carotid, vertebral artery, pharynx, spinal cord. Traditional management: Zone II - direct exploration if platysma violated; Zones I/III - angiography first. Modern management: CTA for all zones in stable patients, guiding selective operative/endovascular intervention. Hard signs (active bleeding, expanding hematoma, stroke, air bubbling, massive hemoptysis) mandate immediate exploration regardless of zone."
