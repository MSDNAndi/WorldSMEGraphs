      "text": "Brachial artery injury is the most common upper extremity arterial trauma, frequently associated with supracondylar humerus fractures in children and penetrating injuries in adults, requiring prompt recognition through pulse examination and Doppler assessment to prevent limb-threatening ischemia.",
      "formal": "Brachial_Artery_Trauma = (Supracondylar_Fracture | Penetrating_Injury | Iatrogenic) + Pulse_Deficit + Urgent_Repair"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "The brachial artery runs right next to the humerus in the arm. When children break their elbow (supracondylar fracture), the broken bone can stretch, kink, or tear this artery. In adults, stab wounds and gunshot injuries are more common causes. Without blood flow, the hand and forearm muscles can die within hours.",
      "key_insight": "The 'pink pulseless hand' in pediatric supracondylar fractures is a management controversy - observation versus exploration. The key distinction is whether ischemia is from arterial spasm/kinking (may improve with fracture reduction) or from intimal injury/thrombosis (requires repair). Serial examinations and Doppler assessment guide management.",
      "technical_details": "The brachial artery is the continuation of the axillary artery at the lower border of teres major, running medially in the arm then crossing anteriorly at the elbow. It bifurcates into radial and ulnar arteries at the antecubital fossa. Injury mechanisms: (1) Supracondylar fracture in children - arterial kinking, spasm, or intimal injury from displaced fragment; (2) Penetrating trauma - stab/GSW in adults; (3) Iatrogenic - cardiac catheterization, ECMO. Collateral circulation via profunda brachii is usually insufficient for acute occlusion. Management: assess hand perfusion (capillary refill, Doppler signals, pulse oximetry waveform), reduce fracture first if displaced, serial examinations, surgical exploration for persistent ischemia. Repair options: primary anastomosis if <2cm gap, vein interposition graft, or temporary shunt if damage control needed."
