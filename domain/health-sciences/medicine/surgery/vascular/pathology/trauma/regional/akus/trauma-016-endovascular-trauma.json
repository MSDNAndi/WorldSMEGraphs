      "text": "Endovascular techniques have revolutionized vascular trauma management, with TEVAR now standard of care for blunt thoracic aortic injury, covered stents used for subclavian and iliac injuries in stable patients, and REBOA providing temporary hemorrhage control in exsanguinating pelvic and abdominal hemorrhage.",

    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Instead of opening the chest or belly to fix a torn blood vessel, we can now often fix it from inside using catheters, balloons, and covered tubes (stent grafts) inserted through small holes in the groin. This is less invasive and often faster, which matters greatly when someone is bleeding to death.",
      "key_insight": "TEVAR has transformed blunt thoracic aortic injury (BTAI) from a highly morbid open thoracotomy to a less invasive procedure with dramatically improved outcomes. The paradigm shift is ongoing for other injuries. However, endovascular approaches require stable access, appropriate anatomy, and available expertise - open surgery remains essential for many scenarios.",
      "technical_details": "Key applications: (1) TEVAR for BTAI - now first-line for most blunt aortic injuries, with 90% coverage at aortic isthmus; left subclavian coverage usually tolerated but consider revascularization if symptomatic or dominant vertebral; (2) Covered stents for subclavian, iliac, axillary injuries in stable patients with suitable anatomy; (3) Embolization for branch vessel hemorrhage (intercostal, lumbar, mesenteric branches); (4) REBOA (resuscitative endovascular balloon occlusion of aorta) - temporary aortic occlusion for hemorrhage control in Zone I (supraceliac) for abdominal hemorrhage or Zone III (infrarenal) for pelvic hemorrhage. Limitations: contaminated field considerations (covered stent infection), long-term durability in young patients, device availability, anatomic constraints."
