      "text": "Venous injury repair in trauma balances the benefits of maintaining venous outflow against the risks of prolonged operative time and potential complications; while ligation is often tolerated, repair of major veins (popliteal, femoral, IVC) improves limb outcomes when performed by experienced surgeons in stable patients.",
      "formal": "Venous_Repair_Decision = f(Vein_Importance, Patient_Stability, Surgeon_Experience, Combined_Arterial_Injury, Time)"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Unlike arteries where repair is almost always necessary, veins can often be tied off because of excellent collateral drainage. However, for major 'highway' veins in the legs, especially when the artery is also injured, keeping the vein open reduces swelling and improves outcomes - if the patient is stable enough.",
      "key_insight": "The critical decision points are: (1) Is this a major named vein (femoral, popliteal, IVC)? (2) Is there concomitant arterial injury? (3) Is the patient in extremis? Combined arteriovenous injuries have worse outcomes with venous ligation, but repair adds operative time and potential thrombosis risk. Damage control surgery prioritizes hemorrhage control - definitive venous repair can wait.",
      "technical_details": "Venous injury patterns: transection, lateral injury, segmental loss. Repair options: lateral venorrhaphy (simple laceration), patch angioplasty (maintains caliber), end-to-end anastomosis (<2cm gap), interposition graft (vein or PTFE with anticoagulation). Ligation-safe veins: most upper extremity, tibial, superficial femoral (some controversy). Repair-preferred: common femoral, popliteal (especially with arterial injury), IVC below renals. For IVC: infrarenal can be ligated if necessary; suprarenal requires repair. Fasciotomy threshold lower with combined injuries. Anticoagulation controversial but may improve repair patency."
