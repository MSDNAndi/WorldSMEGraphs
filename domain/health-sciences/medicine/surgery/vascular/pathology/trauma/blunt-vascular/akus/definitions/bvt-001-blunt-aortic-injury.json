    "statement": {
      "text": "Blunt thoracic aortic injury (BTAI) results from rapid deceleration causing shear forces at the aortic isthmus (just distal to left subclavian artery), where the relatively mobile aortic arch meets the fixed descending aorta. It is the second leading cause of death in motor vehicle accidents. Survivors reaching hospital have contained rupture requiring urgent repair, now predominantly by TEVAR.",
      "formal": "BTAI: Deceleration injury at aortic isthmus; 80-90% prehospital mortality; Survivors have contained rupture; Treatment: TEVAR (now first-line), delayed repair acceptable if stable"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "When a car stops suddenly in a crash, the body stops but internal organs keep moving - like when you slam on the brakes and everything on the seat flies forward. The heart and aortic arch swing forward, but the descending aorta is anchored to the spine. This creates a tearing force at the junction point (isthmus). If the aorta completely ruptures, death is immediate. If the tear is contained by the outer adventitia, the patient may survive to reach hospital.",
      "key_insight": "Most patients with BTAI die at the scene. Those who reach hospital alive have a contained rupture - a race against time, but not necessarily requiring immediate OR. Delayed repair (24-72 hours) after other injuries are stabilized may actually improve outcomes by allowing resuscitation and treatment of associated injuries.",
      "technical_details": "The isthmus (2-3 cm distal to left subclavian origin) accounts for >90% of BTAI. Mechanism: shear forces from differential acceleration between mobile arch and fixed descending aorta. SVS grading: Grade I (intimal tear), II (intramural hematoma), III (pseudoaneurysm), IV (rupture). CT angiography is the diagnostic standard. TEVAR has become first-line therapy with mortality rates of 5-10% vs 15-25% for open repair in trauma."
