    "statement": {
      "text": "Acute Limb Ischemia (ALI) is a sudden decrease in limb perfusion threatening limb viability, typically <14 days duration. It is characterized by the '6 Ps' (Pain, Pallor, Pulselessness, Poikilothermia, Paresthesias, Paralysis) and requires emergent revascularization. Major causes are embolism (cardiac source) and thrombosis (in-situ on diseased artery or graft). Rutherford classification guides urgency of intervention.",
      "formal": "ALI: Sudden limb hypoperfusion <14 days | 6 Ps: Pain, Pallor, Pulselessness, Poikilothermia, Paresthesias, Paralysis | Causes: Embolism (cardiac) or Thrombosis (arterial disease/graft) | Treatment: Emergent revascularization (surgical or endovascular)"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Imagine suddenly cutting off the blood supply to your leg - that's ALI. Within hours, the muscles start to starve for oxygen. First you feel pain and notice the leg is cold and pale. Then nerves start to fail (numbness, tingling). Finally, muscles stop working (weakness, paralysis). Once muscles are dead, the leg is unsalvageable and needs amputation. The clock is ticking from the moment blood flow stops.",
      "key_insight": "The Rutherford classification divides ALI into viable (I), marginally threatened (IIa), immediately threatened (IIb), and irreversibly damaged (III). The key distinction is IIa vs IIb: IIa has sensory loss only and can wait hours; IIb has motor deficit and needs revascularization within 6 hours. Class III (rigor, complete paralysis) means the limb is lost - attempting revascularization risks reperfusion syndrome and death.",
      "technical_details": "Etiology: (1) Embolism (80% cardiac - AFib, recent MI, valve disease) - sudden onset, no PAD history, contralateral pulses present; (2) Thrombosis (in-situ on diseased artery) - history of claudication, bilateral disease; (3) Graft thrombosis - prior bypass surgery. Time windows: Muscle tolerates ~6 hours of warm ischemia; irreversible damage occurs by 8-12 hours. Revascularization options: surgical thromboembolectomy (Fogarty catheter), open bypass, catheter-directed thrombolysis, percutaneous mechanical thrombectomy. Fasciotomy may be needed to prevent compartment syndrome after revascularization.",
      "common_misconceptions": [
        "All limb ischemia is acute - chronic ischemia is more common and less urgent",
        "Pulselessness means irreversible damage - early pulselessness is expected and reversible",
        "All ALI patients need immediate surgery - some can be managed with thrombolysis",
        "Irreversible limb = must amputate immediately - may need to stabilize patient first"
