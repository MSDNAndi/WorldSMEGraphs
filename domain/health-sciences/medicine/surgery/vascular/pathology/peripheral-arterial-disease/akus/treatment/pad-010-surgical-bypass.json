    "statement": {
      "text": "Lower extremity surgical bypass creates new blood flow pathway around blocked arteries using autogenous vein (preferred) or prosthetic conduit. Great saphenous vein (GSV) is the gold standard conduit with superior patency over prosthetic, especially for below-knee targets. Bypass is indicated for CLTI when anatomy is unsuitable for endovascular or after endovascular failure.",
      "formal": "Lower Extremity Bypass: GSV preferred (5yr patency 70-80% above knee, 60-70% below knee); Prosthetic acceptable above knee only; Indications: CLTI with unfavorable endovascular anatomy"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Bypass surgery is like building a detour highway around a blocked road. We take a healthy blood vessel (usually a vein from the leg) and sew it in above and below the blockage to create a new route for blood. Using the patient's own vein is like using local materials that the body doesn't reject - it lasts longer and has fewer complications than synthetic tubes.",
      "key_insight": "GSV is vastly superior to prosthetic for infrainguinal bypass, especially to below-knee targets. 5-year patency for below-knee GSV bypass is 60-70% vs 30-40% for prosthetic. Always perform preoperative vein mapping to assess GSV quality and availability.",
      "technical_details": "Configurations include femoropopliteal (above or below knee), femorotibial, and femoropedal bypasses. In situ technique uses GSV in native position with valve lysis. Reversed vein technique removes and flips the vein. Non-reversed, non-in-situ uses valve lysis without reversal. Target vessel selection is ideally based on angiosome concept for CLI with tissue loss."
