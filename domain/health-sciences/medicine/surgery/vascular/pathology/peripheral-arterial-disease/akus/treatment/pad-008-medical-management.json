    "statement": {
      "text": "Medical management of PAD includes three pillars: (1) cardiovascular risk factor modification (smoking cessation, statin therapy, blood pressure control, diabetes management), (2) antiplatelet therapy (aspirin or clopidogrel), and (3) symptom-directed therapy (supervised exercise, cilostazol for claudication). This reduces both limb events and cardiovascular mortality.",
      "formal": "PAD Medical Therapy: Risk modification (statins, smoking cessation, BP, DM) + Antiplatelet (ASA/clopidogrel) + Symptom therapy (exercise, cilostazol)"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "PAD is not just a leg problem - it's a marker of systemic atherosclerosis. Patients with PAD have the same heart attack and stroke risk as those who've already had one. Medical therapy addresses this by treating the whole cardiovascular system, not just the leg arteries.",
      "key_insight": "Supervised exercise therapy is as effective as revascularization for claudication in many patients, with fewer complications. It should be offered to all patients with claudication before invasive treatment.",
      "technical_details": "Statins reduce MACE by 20-30% regardless of baseline LDL. Target LDL <70 mg/dL for PAD patients. Cilostazol (PDE3 inhibitor) improves walking distance by 50% but is contraindicated in heart failure. Supervised exercise programs (30-45 minutes, 3x/week, for ≥12 weeks) improve walking distance by 50-200%."
