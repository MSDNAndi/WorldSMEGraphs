    "statement": {
      "text": "Peripheral Arterial Disease (PAD) is atherosclerotic occlusive disease affecting arteries outside the coronary, intracranial, and aortic circulation, primarily the lower extremity arteries. It is defined by an Ankle-Brachial Index (ABI) ≤0.90 and manifests as a spectrum from asymptomatic disease to claudication to critical limb-threatening ischemia (CLTI).",
      "formal": "PAD: Atherosclerotic stenosis/occlusion of peripheral arteries | Diagnosis: ABI ≤0.90 | Spectrum: Asymptomatic → Claudication → Rest pain → Tissue loss (CLTI)"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Think of PAD as 'blockages in the leg arteries' caused by the same disease process that causes heart attacks - atherosclerosis. Just as coronary artery disease restricts blood flow to the heart muscle, PAD restricts blood flow to the leg muscles and tissues. The legs need more blood during walking (exercise), so the first symptom is usually cramping during walking that improves with rest (claudication). If blockages become severe, the legs don't get enough blood even at rest, leading to pain and eventually tissue death.",
      "key_insight": "PAD is not just a leg problem - it's a marker of systemic atherosclerosis. Patients with PAD have a 4-6 fold increased risk of cardiovascular death compared to age-matched controls. Managing PAD means treating the whole patient's cardiovascular risk, not just the leg symptoms.",
      "technical_details": "The anatomic distribution of PAD reflects atherosclerosis predilection for arterial bifurcations: aortoiliac (30%), femoropopliteal (80-90%), and infrapopliteal (40-50%). Hemodynamically significant stenosis occurs when lumen is reduced by >50% diameter (>75% area). The ABI is the ratio of highest ankle systolic pressure to highest brachial systolic pressure; values ≤0.90 indicate PAD with sensitivity of 95% and specificity of 99% compared to angiography. Values <0.40 indicate severe disease.",
      "common_misconceptions": [
        "PAD only affects the legs - upper extremity PAD also occurs",
        "PAD is a benign condition - it carries major cardiovascular mortality risk",
        "All PAD patients have claudication - many are asymptomatic",
        "Low ABI means poor leg circulation only - it predicts cardiovascular events"
