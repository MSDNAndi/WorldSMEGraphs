    "statement": {
      "text": "Endovascular treatment of PAD includes balloon angioplasty (PTA), stenting, drug-coated balloons (DCB), drug-eluting stents (DES), and atherectomy. Approach selection depends on lesion location, length, calcification, and clinical presentation. Aortoiliac lesions favor stenting while femoropopliteal lesions favor DCB ± atherectomy with spot stenting for flow-limiting dissection.",
      "formal": "Endovascular PAD: Aortoiliac = primary stenting; Femoropopliteal = DCB ± atherectomy, spot stent; Infrapopliteal = PTA (no stent), consider DCB; Goal: improve flow for CLI, symptom relief for claudication"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Endovascular treatment is like unclogging a drain. Angioplasty uses a balloon to push plaque aside. Stents are metal scaffolds that hold the artery open. Drug-coated balloons deliver medication to prevent the artery from re-narrowing. Atherectomy actually removes the plaque like a small drill or vacuum. Different tools work better in different locations - what works in a straight iliac artery may not work in a bending, twisting SFA.",
      "key_insight": "The femoropopliteal segment presents unique challenges due to its length, flexion/extension with movement, and tendency for restenosis. Avoid stenting the entire SFA - use drug-coated balloons as primary therapy with 'spot stenting' only for bailout situations (flow-limiting dissection, significant recoil).",
      "technical_details": "TASC classification guides approach (A/B = endovascular, C/D = open historically, now often endovascular with improved techniques). Drug-coated technology uses paclitaxel to inhibit neointimal hyperplasia. Atherectomy devices include directional (Silverhawk), orbital (Diamondback), laser, and rotational (Rotablator). Covered stents useful for long femoropopliteal lesions (Viabahn)."
