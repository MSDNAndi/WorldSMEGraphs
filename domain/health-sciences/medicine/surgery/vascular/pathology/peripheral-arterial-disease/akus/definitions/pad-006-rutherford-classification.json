    "statement": {
      "text": "The Rutherford classification categorizes peripheral arterial disease into 7 grades (0-6) based on clinical symptoms and objective findings. It divides PAD into asymptomatic, claudication (mild/moderate/severe), ischemic rest pain, and tissue loss (minor/major). Unlike Fontaine, it uses objective testing (ABI, pulse volume recordings) to assign grades.",
      "formal": "Rutherford Classification: Grade 0 = Asymptomatic | 1-3 = Claudication (mild, moderate, severe) | 4 = Rest pain | 5 = Minor tissue loss | 6 = Major tissue loss | Objective criteria include ABI, PVR, and functional testing"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Rutherford is like a more detailed version of Fontaine, with clearer definitions and objective testing. Fontaine uses Roman numerals and symptom descriptions; Rutherford uses numbers 0-6 and adds objective measurements. Both tell the same story - from no symptoms through claudication to rest pain to tissue loss - but Rutherford is more precise and reproducible.",
      "key_insight": "The key difference from Fontaine is objectivity. Rutherford requires hemodynamic testing (ABI, pulse volume recordings) and functional testing (treadmill) to assign grades. This makes it more reproducible across centers and more useful for research. In clinical practice, you'll often see both systems used interchangeably.",
      "technical_details": "The classification was originally published by Rutherford et al. in 1986 and revised in 1997. Objective criteria: Grade 1 = mild claudication, ABI ≥0.80, treadmill >5 min at 2 mph/12% grade; Grade 2 = moderate, ABI 0.50-0.80, treadmill 1-5 min; Grade 3 = severe, ABI <0.50, treadmill <1 min; Grade 4 = rest pain, ankle pressure <40 mmHg, toe pressure <30 mmHg; Grades 5-6 = tissue loss with same hemodynamic criteria. The Society for Vascular Surgery now prefers the WIfI classification for critical limb ischemia staging.",
      "common_misconceptions": [
        "Rutherford and Fontaine are interchangeable - they differ in criteria and objectivity",
        "Claudication grades are based on walking distance alone - ABI also required",
        "Rutherford replaces Fontaine - both are used, Fontaine in Europe, Rutherford in US",
        "Higher Rutherford grade = worse amputation risk - WIfI is better for prognosis"
