    "statement": {
      "text": "Critical Limb-Threatening Ischemia (CLTI), formerly Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI), is the most severe manifestation of peripheral arterial disease, characterized by chronic ischemic rest pain, ulceration, or gangrene attributable to arterial occlusive disease. Without revascularization, 25% will require major amputation within 1 year and 20-25% will die from cardiovascular events.",
      "formal": "CLTI Definition: Chronic (>2 weeks) ischemia with rest pain OR tissue loss (ulcer/gangrene) + hemodynamic evidence (ABI <0.4, ankle pressure <50 mmHg, or toe pressure <30 mmHg) | Without revascularization: 25% major amputation, 20-25% mortality at 1 year"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "CLTI is when the blood supply to the leg is so poor that it can't even meet the basic needs at rest - the leg starts hurting without any exercise (rest pain), or the tissues start dying (ulcers, gangrene) because there's simply not enough blood to keep them alive. This is a 'leg heart attack' - the same process that blocks heart arteries is now threatening the leg. Without opening up the blood flow, the leg will be lost.",
      "key_insight": "CLTI is not just a leg problem - it's a marker of advanced systemic atherosclerosis. These patients have the highest cardiovascular mortality risk of any PAD subgroup. Treatment must address both limb salvage AND aggressive cardiovascular risk modification. Many CLTI patients die of heart attacks, not from their leg disease.",
      "technical_details": "The 2019 Global Vascular Guidelines introduced CLTI and the WIfI classification (Wound, Ischemia, foot Infection) to replace CLI, emphasizing that tissue loss severity, degree of ischemia, and infection status all contribute to amputation risk. WIfI stages limb threat from 1 (very low) to 4 (very high). Hemodynamic criteria for CLTI: ABI <0.4, ankle pressure <50-70 mmHg, toe pressure <30-50 mmHg, TcPO2 <30 mmHg. Revascularization options include endovascular (angioplasty, stent, atherectomy) or surgical bypass, guided by anatomy and GLASS staging.",
      "common_misconceptions": [
        "CLTI can be treated with pills - revascularization is required for limb salvage",
        "Amputation is inevitable - 70-80% of limbs can be salvaged with revascularization",
        "Claudication will always progress to CLTI - only 15-20% of claudicants progress",
        "CLTI is a local leg problem - it's a systemic atherosclerotic emergency"
