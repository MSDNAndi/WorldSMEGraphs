    "statement": {
      "text": "Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) presents across a clinical spectrum: asymptomatic (20-50%), intermittent claudication (10-35%), and chronic limb-threatening ischemia (CLTI) with rest pain and/or tissue loss (1-3%). Classic claudication is reproducible, exercise-induced leg muscle pain that resolves within 10 minutes of rest.",

    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Think of PAD like a clogged pipe limiting water flow to a garden. When the plant is resting, there's enough flow. But when it's hot (exercising), demand exceeds supply and the plant wilts (pain). As the blockage worsens, there's not enough flow even at rest. Eventually, the plant dies (tissue loss).",
      "key_insight": "Most PAD patients are asymptomatic or have atypical symptoms. Classic claudication affects only 10-35%. This is because collateral blood vessels develop slowly as arteries narrow, maintaining rest perfusion until disease is severe.",
      "technical_details": "Claudication typically affects muscle groups one level below the arterial occlusion: aortoiliac disease → buttock/thigh claudication; femoropopliteal → calf claudication. Rest pain indicates critical ischemia with ankle pressure <50 mmHg or toe pressure <30 mmHg. It typically affects the forefoot and worsens at night (loss of gravity-assisted perfusion when supine)."
