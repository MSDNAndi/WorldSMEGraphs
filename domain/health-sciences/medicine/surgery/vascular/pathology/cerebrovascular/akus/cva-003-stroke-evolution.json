      "text": "Stroke in evolution refers to progressive neurologic deterioration over hours to days, often from unstable carotid plaque with ongoing embolization, representing a relative indication for urgent carotid intervention if CT shows no hemorrhage or large completed infarct.",

    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "A stroke in evolution is like a building that's partially collapsed and still crumbling. The initial damage is done, but more is happening in real time. Stabilizing the source (the carotid plaque) may prevent further damage.",
      "key_insight": "Unlike completed stroke where tissue is already infarcted, stroke in evolution represents ongoing ischemia where salvageable brain remains at risk. Urgent CEA may be considered to halt progression, though operative timing remains controversial.",
      "technical_details": "Definition: worsening neurologic deficit over hours to days after initial stroke. Mechanism: ongoing embolization from unstable plaque, propagating thrombus. Workup: urgent CT (rule out hemorrhage), CTA (confirm source), perfusion imaging (identify penumbra). Treatment options: anticoagulation, urgent CEA (controversial - some advocate if CT clear), endovascular thrombectomy. Timing: historically delayed 4-6 weeks post-stroke; current trend toward earlier intervention if imaging favorable."
