  "content": {
    "definition": {
      "formal": "Stroke in evolution refers to a syndrome of progressively worsening neurological deficits following the initial presentation of an acute ischemic stroke. Deterioration may be stepwise or gradual and reflects ongoing ischemia in the penumbral zone or extension of the infarct.",
      "clinical": "A patient whose stroke symptoms are getting worse over hours to days, indicating that the brain injury is expanding and intervention may still salvage tissue."
    },
    "core_concepts": [
      {
        "concept": "Pathophysiology",
        "explanation": "Multiple mechanisms contribute: (1) ongoing embolization from proximal source, (2) propagation of thrombus in cerebral arteries, (3) failure of collateral circulation, (4) penumbral failure from hypoperfusion, (5) hemorrhagic transformation. The ischemic penumbra (at-risk but not yet infarcted tissue) is the therapeutic target.",
        "clinical_significance": "Understanding the mechanism guides treatment. Thrombus propagation may respond to anticoagulation; embolic source requires intervention on that source."
      },
      {
        "concept": "Clinical Recognition",
        "explanation": "Defined by documented neurological worsening on serial examinations. May be stepwise (sudden worsenings) or gradual (progressive decline). NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS) increase of \u22652 points is commonly used threshold.",
        "clinical_significance": "Requires frequent, documented neurological assessments. Early recognition triggers investigation and potential intervention."
      },
      {
        "concept": "Timing Considerations",
        "explanation": "Progression is most common in the first 24-48 hours after stroke onset. Late progression (>72 hours) is often due to complications (edema, hemorrhage, infection) rather than ongoing ischemia.",
        "clinical_significance": "Early progression may be reversible with appropriate intervention. Late progression has different causes and management."
      },
      {
        "concept": "Role of Imaging",
        "explanation": "Repeat brain imaging (CT or MRI) is essential. DWI-MRI shows completed infarct. Perfusion imaging identifies penumbra (mismatch between perfusion deficit and infarct core). CTA or MRA identifies residual occlusion.",
        "clinical_significance": "Imaging distinguishes treatable conditions (residual occlusion with penumbra) from untreatable (completed large infarct)."
      },
      {
        "concept": "Role of Carotid Disease",
        "explanation": "Ipsilateral severe carotid stenosis or occlusion may contribute to progression through reduced perfusion or ongoing embolization. Urgent revascularization may be considered in selected cases.",
