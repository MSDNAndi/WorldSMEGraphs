    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Radiation to the neck (for cancer treatment) damages the blood vessel walls over years, causing them to scar and narrow faster than normal atherosclerosis. The tissue is stiff, friable, and harder to repair surgically.",
      "key_insight": "Radiation changes occur 10-20 years post-treatment. The disease is often longer segment, more fibrotic, and extends higher toward skull base. Wound healing is impaired, making CEA higher risk; CAS is often preferred.",
      "technical_details": "Pathology: radiation accelerates vasa vasorum damage, intimal fibrosis, medial necrosis. Latency: 10-20 years post-XRT. Distribution: often long-segment, extends more distal, bilateral. Challenges: fibrotic tissue difficult to endarterectomize, impaired wound healing, cranial nerve injury risk. Treatment preference: CAS often favored over CEA due to wound concerns, though restenosis rates may be higher. Surveillance: annual duplex in XRT patients."
