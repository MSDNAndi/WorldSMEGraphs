    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Just as some people form thick scars on their skin, some form excessive scar tissue inside their arteries after surgery. Early restenosis is this exuberant healing response; late restenosis is the disease coming back.",
      "key_insight": "Early restenosis (<2 years) is due to myointimal hyperplasia which is generally stable and rarely causes stroke. Late restenosis (>2 years) is recurrent atherosclerosis with higher stroke risk. CAS is often preferred for recurrent stenosis due to scarring.",
      "technical_details": "Incidence: 5-10% significant restenosis post-CEA. Early (<2 years): myointimal hyperplasia - smooth, stable, low embolic risk. Late (>2 years): recurrent atherosclerosis - irregular, higher embolic risk. Treatment indications: similar to primary stenosis. Treatment options: CAS preferred (avoids surgical scarring), redo CEA technically challenging. Risk factors for restenosis: female sex, smoking, patch vs primary closure (lower with patch)."
