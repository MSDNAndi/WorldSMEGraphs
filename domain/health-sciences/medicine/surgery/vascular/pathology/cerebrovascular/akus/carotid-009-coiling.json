      "text": "Carotid coiling and kinking are elongation abnormalities of the internal carotid artery that may rarely cause hemodynamically significant stenosis with neck movement, sometimes warranting surgical correction when symptomatic.",

    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "The carotid artery can become excessively long and twisted over time, like a garden hose that's been coiled up. Usually this causes no problem, but in rare cases the kinks can crimp blood flow with certain head positions.",
      "key_insight": "Most carotid coiling/kinking is asymptomatic and found incidentally. Symptomatic cases require exclusion of other causes of TIA/stroke before attributing symptoms to the kink. Dynamic angiography with head movement may reveal positional stenosis.",
      "technical_details": "Classification: tortuosity (mild), coiling (complete loop), kinking (acute angle). Etiology: congenital elongation, atherosclerosis, hypertension, aging. Incidence: 10-25% of population (mostly asymptomatic). Symptoms: rare, positional TIA/stroke symptoms. Diagnosis: duplex with head rotation, dynamic angiography. Treatment: surgical shortening or resection if definitively symptomatic after excluding other causes."
