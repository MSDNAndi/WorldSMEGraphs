    "statement": {
      "text": "Extracranial carotid artery aneurysm is a rare condition (0.4-4% of peripheral aneurysms) presenting with pulsatile neck mass, neurologic symptoms from embolization, or compression of adjacent structures, requiring surgical repair due to stroke risk.",

    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Unlike aortic aneurysms that rupture, carotid aneurysms primarily cause strokes from clot forming inside and embolizing to the brain. The growing mass can also compress nearby nerves causing hoarseness or difficulty swallowing.",
      "key_insight": "Stroke risk (not rupture) drives intervention for carotid aneurysms. Neurologic event rate is 50-70% without treatment. Repair options include open resection with reconstruction or endovascular covered stent.",
      "technical_details": "Etiology: atherosclerosis (most common), trauma, infection (mycotic), FMD, dissection, connective tissue disorders. Location: most at bifurcation. Presentation: pulsatile mass (93%), neurologic symptoms (50%), cranial nerve compression (30%). Diagnosis: duplex, CTA, MRA. Treatment: resection with primary repair, interposition graft, or patch; endovascular covered stent for select cases. Outcomes: 2-5% perioperative stroke rate."
