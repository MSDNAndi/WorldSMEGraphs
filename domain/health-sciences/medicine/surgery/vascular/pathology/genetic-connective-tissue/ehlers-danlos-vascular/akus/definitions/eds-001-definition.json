      "text": "Vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (vEDS, formerly EDS Type IV) is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by COL3A1 mutations affecting type III collagen synthesis. It is the most severe form of EDS, characterized by arterial, intestinal, and uterine fragility with high risk of spontaneous rupture. Median survival is 50 years, with major complications occurring by age 40 in most patients.",
      "formal": "vEDS: AD, COL3A1 mutation; Arterial/visceral/uterine rupture; Thin translucent skin, acrogeria; Most lethal EDS type, median survival ~50 years"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Type III collagen is the main structural protein in blood vessel walls and hollow organs. In vEDS, this collagen is defective - imagine building a pressurized pipe with substandard materials. The vessels look normal but can rupture spontaneously without warning, even at normal blood pressures. Unlike Marfan where vessels dilate before rupture, vEDS vessels can rupture without prior aneurysm formation.",
      "key_insight": "Surgery in vEDS is extremely hazardous due to tissue fragility - tissues tear during handling, sutures pull through, and healing is impaired. Conservative management is preferred whenever possible. When surgery is unavoidable, meticulous technique with pledgets and buttressing is essential.",
      "technical_details": "COL3A1 mutations result in abnormal type III procollagen that interferes with normal collagen fibril formation (dominant negative effect). Diagnosis requires genetic testing (COL3A1 mutation) or characteristic biochemical abnormalities (abnormal type III collagen ratio on skin biopsy fibroblast culture). Major arterial complications affect medium-sized arteries: iliac, splenic, renal arteries more than aorta."
