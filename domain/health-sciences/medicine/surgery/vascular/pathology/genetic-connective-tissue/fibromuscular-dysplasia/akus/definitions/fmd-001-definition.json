      "text": "Fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) is a non-atherosclerotic, non-inflammatory arteriopathy causing stenosis, aneurysm, and dissection, primarily affecting young to middle-aged women. It most commonly involves renal arteries (60-75%) and cervicocephalic arteries (carotid, vertebral) with characteristic 'string of beads' angiographic appearance in medial FMD.",
      "formal": "FMD: Non-atherosclerotic, non-inflammatory; Demographics: F>M (9:1), age 30-50; Distribution: renal (60-75%), carotid/vertebral (25-30%); Classic finding: 'string of beads' on angiography"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "FMD is like a manufacturing defect in the arterial wall that causes it to form in an irregular, beaded pattern rather than as a smooth tube. Unlike atherosclerosis (caused by plaque buildup) or vasculitis (caused by inflammation), FMD is an intrinsic abnormality of the arterial wall structure itself, typically developing before middle age.",
      "key_insight": "FMD is a systemic arteriopathy - finding it in one vascular bed should prompt screening of other beds. 50-70% of patients have multifocal disease. Associated intracranial aneurysms occur in 7-15% of patients with cervicocephalic FMD.",
      "technical_details": "Three histologic types exist: medial FMD (most common, 'string of beads'), intimal FMD (focal stenosis, younger patients), and adventitial FMD (rare). The 'string of beads' appearance results from alternating stenotic (fibroplasia) and dilated (weakened media) segments. The beads are typically larger than normal vessel diameter. FMD typically involves mid and distal arterial segments, sparing origins - opposite of atherosclerosis."
