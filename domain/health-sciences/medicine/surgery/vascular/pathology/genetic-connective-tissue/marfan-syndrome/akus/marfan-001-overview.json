        "concept": "Cardiovascular Manifestations",
        "explanation": "Primary vascular features include: aortic root dilation (sinuses of Valsalva), aortic regurgitation, mitral valve prolapse, and type A aortic dissection. The ascending aorta and root are most affected; descending aortic disease occurs later."

        "concept": "Aortic Root Dilation and Z-Score",
        "explanation": "Z-score normalizes aortic root diameter for body surface area. Z-score \u22652 is significant; \u22653 is severe. In adults, aortic root >40mm indicates increased risk; surgery typically recommended at 50mm (45mm with risk factors)."
      },
      {
        "concept": "Surgical Thresholds",
        "explanation": "Prophylactic surgery recommended at: 50mm (no risk factors), 45mm (family history of dissection, rapid growth >5mm/year, severe aortic regurgitation, pregnancy desire), or 40mm if undergoing other cardiac surgery."

      {
        "concept": "Valve-Sparing Root Replacement",
        "explanation": "David operation (reimplantation) and Yacoub procedure (remodeling) preserve the native aortic valve while replacing the aortic root, avoiding need for lifelong anticoagulation."
