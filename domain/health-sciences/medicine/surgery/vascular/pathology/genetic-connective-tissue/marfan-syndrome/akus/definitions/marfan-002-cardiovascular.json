      "text": "Cardiovascular manifestations of Marfan syndrome are the primary determinant of life expectancy. Aortic root dilation (affecting 80-90%) leads to aortic regurgitation and risk of dissection. Prophylactic aortic root replacement is indicated when diameter reaches 5.0 cm (4.5 cm with risk factors). Valve-sparing root replacement is preferred when feasible.",
      "formal": "Marfan CV: Aortic root dilation (80-90%), MVP (75%); Intervention: prophylactic surgery at 5.0cm (or 4.5cm with risk factors); Preferred: valve-sparing root replacement (David)"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "In Marfan syndrome, the aorta near the heart is like a balloon made of defective material. It slowly stretches under the constant pressure of each heartbeat. As it stretches, the aortic valve starts to leak (regurgitation), and the risk of the aorta tearing (dissection) increases. We replace the aorta before it tears, ideally preserving the patient's own valve if healthy.",
      "key_insight": "Prophylactic aortic surgery transformed Marfan syndrome from a disease with average lifespan of 40 years to near-normal life expectancy. The key is surveillance to detect enlargement and timely surgery before dissection occurs. Once dissected, outcomes are much worse.",
      "technical_details": "The aortic root in Marfan shows cystic medial degeneration from abnormal fibrillin-1. Dilation typically starts at the sinuses of Valsalva, creating 'onion bulb' appearance. Intervention thresholds: 5.0 cm absolute, or 4.5 cm with family history of dissection, rapid growth (>3mm/year), severe AR, or pregnancy desire. Valve-sparing (David procedure) has excellent durability when valve is normal."
