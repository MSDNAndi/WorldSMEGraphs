    "statement": {
      "text": "Marfan syndrome is an autosomal dominant connective tissue disorder caused by mutations in FBN1 (fibrillin-1 gene) on chromosome 15, affecting approximately 1:5,000 individuals. Cardiovascular manifestations - particularly aortic root dilation and dissection - are the primary cause of reduced life expectancy, making early surveillance and prophylactic surgery essential.",
      "formal": "Marfan: AD inheritance, FBN1 mutation (chr15), 1:5000 prevalence; CV manifestations (aortic root dilation, MVP) drive morbidity/mortality"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Fibrillin-1 is like the scaffolding that holds your blood vessels together. In Marfan syndrome, this scaffolding is defective, so the walls of arteries - especially the aorta - are weaker than normal. Over time, blood pressure slowly stretches these weak walls like an overinflated balloon, particularly at the aortic root where stress is highest.",
      "key_insight": "Marfan syndrome transformed from a uniformly fatal disease (average lifespan 40 years) to near-normal life expectancy with proper surveillance and prophylactic aortic surgery. The key is preventing aortic dissection through early detection and timely intervention.",
      "technical_details": "Fibrillin-1 mutations cause increased TGF-β signaling, leading to elastic fiber fragmentation and cystic medial degeneration. Diagnosis uses revised Ghent criteria (2010): aortic root Z-score ≥2 + ectopia lentis = sufficient; or FBN1 mutation + aortic root Z-score ≥2; or systemic score ≥7 + aortic root Z-score ≥2."
