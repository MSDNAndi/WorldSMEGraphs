    "statement": {
      "text": "Loeys-Dietz syndrome (LDS) is an autosomal dominant connective tissue disorder caused by mutations in TGF-β pathway genes (TGFBR1, TGFBR2, SMAD3, TGFB2, TGFB3), characterized by arterial tortuosity, widespread aneurysms, hypertelorism, and bifid uvula. LDS carries a more aggressive vascular phenotype than Marfan syndrome, with dissection occurring at smaller aortic diameters.",
      "formal": "LDS: AD, TGF-β pathway mutations (5 types); Features: arterial tortuosity, aneurysms beyond aortic root, hypertelorism, bifid uvula; More aggressive than Marfan - dissection at smaller sizes"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "If Marfan syndrome affects the scaffolding of blood vessels, Loeys-Dietz is like having that scaffolding improperly assembled from the start. The TGF-β signaling pathway is crucial for how blood vessels develop and maintain their structure. When this pathway malfunctions, arteries throughout the body become abnormally twisted and prone to aneurysms - not just the aortic root.",
      "key_insight": "LDS patients dissect at smaller aortic diameters than Marfan patients. Intervention thresholds are therefore lower (typically 4.0-4.5 cm for the aortic root vs 5.0 cm in Marfan). Additionally, aneurysms occur throughout the arterial tree, requiring head-to-pelvis surveillance imaging.",
      "technical_details": "Five LDS types based on causative gene: LDS1 (TGFBR1), LDS2 (TGFBR2), LDS3 (SMAD3), LDS4 (TGFB2), LDS5 (TGFB3). LDS1/2 are most common and most severe. Characteristic triad: arterial aneurysm/tortuosity + hypertelorism (widely-spaced eyes) + bifid/broad uvula. Unlike Marfan, ectopia lentis is NOT seen in LDS."
