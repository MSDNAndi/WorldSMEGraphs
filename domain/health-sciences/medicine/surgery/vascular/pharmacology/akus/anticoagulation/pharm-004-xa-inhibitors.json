    "statement": {
      "text": "Direct factor Xa inhibitors (rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban) are oral anticoagulants that directly inhibit activated factor X without requiring antithrombin, offering predictable pharmacokinetics, fixed dosing, and reduced monitoring compared to warfarin, with andexanet alfa available for reversal in life-threatening bleeding.",
      "formal": "Xa_Inhibitors = Direct_Xa_Binding + Oral + Predictable_PK + No_Monitoring + Andexanet_Reversal"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "These newer blood thinners block one specific clotting factor (Xa) directly. Unlike warfarin, they work quickly, have consistent effects, and don't need regular blood tests. However, they have a specific antidote (andexanet) that can reverse them in emergencies, though it's very expensive.",
      "key_insight": "The factor Xa inhibitors have largely replaced warfarin for many indications due to convenience and reduced bleeding complications. Key distinctions: apixaban has the best safety profile and least renal dependence; rivaroxaban requires once-daily dosing with food; edoxaban requires prior parenteral anticoagulation for VTE. All are contraindicated in mechanical heart valves.",
      "technical_details": "Mechanism: Direct, competitive, reversible inhibition of free and clot-bound factor Xa. Rivaroxaban: 80-100% bioavailability (with food), 66% renal elimination, once daily, 5-9 hour half-life. Apixaban: 50% bioavailability, 27% renal elimination (least renal dependent), twice daily, 12 hour half-life, best safety in elderly. Edoxaban: 62% bioavailability, 50% renal elimination, once daily, unique - requires 5 days parenteral lead-in for VTE. Fondaparinux is a parenteral indirect Xa inhibitor (works through antithrombin). Reversal: andexanet alfa (recombinant modified factor Xa decoy) reverses rivaroxaban and apixaban; 4-factor PCC is alternative."
