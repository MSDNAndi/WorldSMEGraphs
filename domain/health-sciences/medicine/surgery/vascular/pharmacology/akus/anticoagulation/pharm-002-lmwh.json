      "text": "Low molecular weight heparins (LMWH) are depolymerized heparin fragments with predictable pharmacokinetics enabling fixed-dose or weight-based dosing without routine monitoring, primarily inhibiting factor Xa with reduced anti-thrombin activity compared to unfractionated heparin.",
      "formal": "LMWH = Depolymerized_Heparin + Anti_Xa >> Anti_IIa + Predictable_PK + Weight_Based_Dosing"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "LMWH is a refined version of regular heparin with more consistent effects. Because it's predictable, you can give a dose based on the patient's weight without constantly checking blood tests. It works mainly by blocking one clotting factor (Xa) rather than several.",
      "key_insight": "LMWH advantages over UFH include: predictable dose-response (no routine aPTT monitoring), once or twice daily subcutaneous dosing, outpatient treatment feasibility, lower HIT risk, and reduced osteoporosis risk with long-term use. The trade-off is longer half-life making reversal more difficult and need for dose adjustment in renal impairment.",
      "technical_details": "LMWHs are derived from UFH depolymerization (MW 4000-6000 Da vs 12000-15000 Da for UFH). The anti-Xa:anti-IIa ratio varies: enoxaparin 3.8:1, dalteparin 2.7:1, tinzaparin 1.9:1. Bioavailability >90% SC (vs 30% for UFH). Half-life 3-6 hours (longer than UFH), renally cleared. Dosing: enoxaparin 1 mg/kg q12h treatment, 30-40 mg q12-24h prophylaxis; dalteparin 200 IU/kg daily treatment. Monitoring anti-Xa levels in: renal impairment, extremes of weight, pregnancy, prolonged treatment. Renal adjustment: reduce dose or switch to UFH if CrCl <30. Partial reversal with protamine (60% of anti-Xa activity neutralized)."
