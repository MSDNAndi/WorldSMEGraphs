### 3. Expert Review Workflow

#### Domain Expert Requirements

For comprehensive review, the following expert types should review the content:

| Expert Type | Review Focus | Status |
|-------------|--------------|--------|
| Academic Vascular Surgeon | Clinical accuracy, completeness | Pending |
| Vascular Surgery Fellow | Trainee perspective, learning needs | Pending |
| Interventional Radiologist | Endovascular techniques | Pending |
| Transplant Surgeon | Transplant vascular content | Pending |
| Pediatric Surgeon | Pediatric vascular content | Pending |
| Cardiac Surgeon | ECMO, hybrid procedures | Pending |

#### Review Process

1. **Initial Review**: Domain expert reviews AKUs for accuracy
2. **Feedback Integration**: Update AKUs based on expert comments
3. **Peer Validation**: Second expert confirms corrections
4. **Final Approval**: Quality coordinator marks as validated

|--------|--------|---------|
| AKUs per module | ≥5 | 1-2 (building) |
| Evidence level citations | ≥3 per AKU | 1-2 average |
| Cross-domain links | ≥2 per AKU | Achieved |
| Learning objectives | 4+ per AKU | Achieved |
| Clinical pearls | 3+ per AKU | Achieved |

## Next Steps

1. **Complete HIGH priority AKUs** for each new module
2. **Expert review solicitation** for new subspecialty content
3. **Cross-reference validation** with Rutherford's chapters
4. **Integration testing** - ensure new modules link properly to existing content
5. **Rendered output** - generate human-readable versions for review
