    "statement": {
      "text": "The 'bovine arch' is the most common aortic arch variant (15-25% of population), characterized by a common origin of the innominate (brachiocephalic) and left common carotid arteries from the aortic arch, affecting catheter navigation and surgical planning for arch procedures.",
      "formal": "Bovine_Arch = Common_Origin(Innominate + Left_CCA) | Origin_of_Left_CCA_from_Innominate"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Normally, three separate arteries come off the aortic arch. In a 'bovine arch,' the left carotid artery shares its takeoff with the innominate artery, or actually arises from the innominate. This changes the angles and approach for any catheter or surgery involving these vessels.",
      "key_insight": "The term 'bovine arch' is actually a misnomer - true bovine anatomy has a single trunk giving rise to all four great vessels. In humans, 'bovine arch' refers to two patterns: (1) common origin of innominate and left CCA from the arch, or (2) left CCA arising from the innominate artery itself. Both affect endovascular access and surgical planning.",
      "technical_details": "Normal arch anatomy (70-75%): innominate, left CCA, and left subclavian arise separately. Bovine variants: Type A (~15%) - common origin of innominate and left CCA from arch; Type B (~7%) - left CCA arises from innominate artery itself. Clinical implications: catheterization of left CCA may be more difficult (acute angle), increased stroke risk during TAVR due to manipulation in arch, affects TEVAR planning for proximal landing zones, surgical exposure may need modification. Identified on CTA, MRA, or arch aortography."
