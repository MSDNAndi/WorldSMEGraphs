      "text": "Accessory renal arteries are present in 25-30% of individuals, typically arising from the aorta to supply the upper or lower pole of the kidney as end arteries; their recognition is essential during aortic surgery, renal transplant, and renal artery interventions to prevent segmental kidney infarction.",

    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Instead of having one main blood supply pipe to each kidney, about a quarter of people have extra pipes. These extras usually supply the top or bottom of the kidney and have no backup - if you cut them, that part of the kidney dies.",
      "key_insight": "Accessory renal arteries are END ARTERIES with no significant collateralization. Inadvertent ligation during aortic surgery causes segmental infarction. Lower pole arteries crossing anterior to the ureter can cause UPJ obstruction. CTA planning is essential for aortic surgery.",
      "technical_details": "Embryology: renal arteries develop from lateral mesonephric arteries; failure of the usual arteries to regress results in multiple arteries. Prevalence: 25-30% have accessory arteries, bilateral in 10%. Upper pole arteries usually arise from aorta above main renal; lower pole from aorta, iliac, or main renal below its branching. Caliber typically 2-4mm. Lower pole arteries crossing anterior to ureter associated with UPJ obstruction. Clinical relevance: (1) Aortic surgery - must identify on CTA, decide reimplantation vs sacrifice based on kidney function, size, and whether it supplies >1/3 of parenchyma; (2) Renal transplant - multiple arteries increase technical complexity; (3) Laparoscopic nephrectomy - critical to identify all vessels."
