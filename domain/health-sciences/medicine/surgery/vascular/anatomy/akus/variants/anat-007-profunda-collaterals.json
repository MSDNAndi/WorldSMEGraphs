      "text": "The profunda femoris (deep femoral) artery is the critical collateral pathway for lower extremity perfusion when the superficial femoral artery is occluded, with its three perforating branches communicating with the popliteal artery via geniculate anastomoses.",

    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "The profunda femoris is like a backup highway through the thigh. When the main road (SFA) is blocked, blood detours through the profunda and its branches, which connect to vessels around the knee, keeping the leg alive.",
      "key_insight": "A patent, disease-free profunda femoris is critical for limb viability in SFA occlusion. Profundoplasty (surgical enlargement) may significantly improve claudication when profunda origin is stenotic.",
      "technical_details": "Origin: posterolateral from CFA, 2-5cm below inguinal ligament. Branches: lateral femoral circumflex, medial femoral circumflex, three perforating branches. Collateral pathways: perforators → geniculate network → popliteal artery. Clinical relevance: (1) SFA occlusion with good profunda = mild claudication, (2) Combined SFA/profunda disease = critical ischemia, (3) Profundoplasty indication when origin stenosis >50%."
