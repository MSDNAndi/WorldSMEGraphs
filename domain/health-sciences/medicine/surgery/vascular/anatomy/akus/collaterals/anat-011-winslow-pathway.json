      "text": "The Winslow pathway is a critical collateral route connecting the subclavian arteries to the femoral arteries via the internal mammary, superior and inferior epigastric, and external iliac arteries, providing essential alternative blood supply in chronic aortoiliac occlusive disease.",
      "formal": "Winslow_Pathway: Subclavian → Internal_Mammary → Superior_Epigastric → Inferior_Epigastric → External_Iliac → Femoral"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "When the aorta becomes blocked, blood can't take the normal highway to the legs. The Winslow pathway is like a long detour through the chest wall - blood flows down through the internal mammary arteries in the chest, connects to the abdominal wall arteries, and eventually reaches the leg arteries from above.",
      "key_insight": "The Winslow pathway explains how patients with complete aortic occlusion can still walk. These collaterals hypertrophy over time in chronic occlusion. Surgeons must be aware of these dilated vessels during abdominal surgery - injury can cause significant bleeding and compromise lower extremity perfusion.",
      "technical_details": "The pathway flows: subclavian → internal thoracic (mammary) → superior epigastric → rectus sheath → inferior epigastric → external iliac → common femoral. Hypertrophies in chronic aortoiliac occlusion, coarctation, or after prior aortic surgery. These vessels can enlarge to 5-10mm diameter. Bilateral pathways typically develop. Associated with Leriche syndrome (aortic occlusion triad: claudication, impotence, diminished femoral pulses). Surgical implications: avoid injury during median sternotomy (dilated IMAs), abdominal surgery (epigastric vessels), or inguinal incisions. Embolization of IMAs before CABG may be problematic if Winslow pathway is the primary leg supply."
