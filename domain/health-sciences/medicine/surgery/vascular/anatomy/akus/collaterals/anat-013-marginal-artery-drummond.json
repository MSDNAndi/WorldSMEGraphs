    "statement": {
      "text": "The marginal artery of Drummond is a continuous arterial arcade running along the mesenteric border of the colon, connecting branches of the SMA and IMA, with critical watershed zones at Griffiths point (splenic flexure) and Sudeck point (rectosigmoid junction) where the arcade may be incomplete or attenuated.",
      "formal": "Marginal_Artery: Ileocolic → Right_Colic → Middle_Colic → Left_Colic → Sigmoid → Superior_Rectal (Watershed: Griffiths_Point, Sudeck_Point)"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Picture a continuous blood vessel running along the inside edge of the entire colon like a highway, with on-ramps from the SMA arteries (right side) and IMA arteries (left side). At two spots - near the splenic flexure and at the rectosigmoid - this highway gets narrow or may have gaps, making these areas vulnerable when blood supply is reduced.",
      "key_insight": "The marginal artery is the final common pathway for colonic blood supply. Understanding its watershed zones explains why splenic flexure and rectosigmoid junction are most vulnerable to ischemia during hypotension, aortic surgery, or IMA ligation. These same areas are preferentially involved in ischemic colitis.",
      "technical_details": "The marginal artery runs 1-2 cm from the mesenteric border of the colon, connecting all colic branches (ileocolic → right colic → middle colic → left colic → sigmoid → superior rectal). It gives off vasa recta to the bowel wall. Griffiths point: junction of middle colic (SMA) and left colic (IMA) territories at splenic flexure - marginal artery absent/small in 5-50%. Sudeck point: junction of sigmoid and superior rectal arteries at rectosigmoid - critical point for last sigmoid branch. During AAA repair with IMA ligation, these watersheds determine ischemia risk. Post-op sigmoid ischemia most common after aortic surgery."
