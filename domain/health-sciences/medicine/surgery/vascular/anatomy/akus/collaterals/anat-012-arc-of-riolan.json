    "statement": {
      "text": "The arc of Riolan (meandering mesenteric artery) is a direct arterial connection between the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) and inferior mesenteric artery (IMA) territories, located in the mesentery near the root, providing critical collateral flow when either vessel is occluded.",
      "formal": "Arc_of_Riolan: SMA_Territory ↔ IMA_Territory (Direct_Mesenteric_Connection)"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "The intestines have two main blood supplies - the SMA (small bowel and right colon) and IMA (left colon). The arc of Riolan is like a secret tunnel connecting these two systems, allowing blood to flow from one to the other if needed. When the IMA is blocked, this arc brings blood from the SMA to feed the left colon.",
      "key_insight": "The arc of Riolan is a DIRECT central connection distinct from the marginal artery of Drummond (which runs along the bowel wall). Its presence and size are variable - when hypertrophied, it indicates chronic mesenteric occlusion. During aortic surgery, ligation of the IMA is safe if the arc of Riolan and marginal artery are patent, but identifying a meandering artery preoperatively suggests the IMA is an important collateral source.",
      "technical_details": "The arc of Riolan connects the middle colic artery (SMA branch) with the left colic artery (IMA branch) through a direct mesenteric arcade, located more centrally than the peripheral marginal artery of Drummond. Present in 50-70% of individuals but typically small. Enlarges in chronic SMA or IMA occlusion - a dilated 'meandering mesenteric artery' on angiography indicates significant upstream disease. Surgical relevance: (1) IMA reimplantation may be necessary during AAA repair if meandering artery is dominant, (2) provides target for SMA embolectomy approach, (3) injury during mesenteric surgery causes ischemia."
