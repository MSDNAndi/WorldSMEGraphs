    "title": "Radiofrequency Ablation (RFA) for Varicose Veins",

      {
        "term": "Mechanism",

        "term": "Indications",
        "description": "Symptomatic great saphenous vein (GSV) or small saphenous vein (SSV) reflux; CEAP C2-C6 disease; typically for veins 3-12mm diameter; straight vein course"

        "term": "Tumescent Anesthesia",
        "description": "Dilute local anesthetic (0.1% lidocaine with epinephrine in saline) injected around vein under ultrasound guidance; provides anesthesia, compresses vein for wall contact, and protects surrounding tissue from thermal injury"

        "term": "Outcomes",
        "description": "Occlusion rates >95% at 5 years; equivalent or superior to stripping; faster recovery than surgery; less pain and bruising than laser ablation"

        "term": "Comparison with EVLT",
