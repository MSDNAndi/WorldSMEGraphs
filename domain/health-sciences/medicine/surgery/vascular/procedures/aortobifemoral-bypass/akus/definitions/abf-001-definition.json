    "title": "Aortobifemoral Bypass (ABF)",
    "definition": "Open surgical bypass using a prosthetic Y-graft from the infrarenal aorta to both common femoral arteries, bypassing aortoiliac occlusive disease (AIOD). Gold standard surgical treatment for TASC D aortoiliac lesions with excellent long-term patency (85-90% at 5 years).",

        "term": "Indications",

        "term": "Graft Material",
        "description": "Knitted or woven Dacron (polyester); ePTFE (PTFE) less common for aortic position; Y-configuration (bifurcated graft) with limbs to each femoral"

        "term": "Surgical Approach",
        "description": "Transperitoneal (midline laparotomy) or retroperitoneal (left flank incision) for aortic exposure; bilateral groin incisions for femoral anastomoses"

        "term": "Patency Rates",
        "description": "Primary patency 85-90% at 5 years, 75-80% at 10 years; superior to endovascular treatment for TASC D lesions; gold standard comparison"

      {
        "term": "Complications",
