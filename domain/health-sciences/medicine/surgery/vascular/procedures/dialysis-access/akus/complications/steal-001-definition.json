    "definition": "Dialysis access steal syndrome occurs when blood preferentially flows through the low-resistance fistula or graft rather than to the hand, causing distal ischemia. Severity ranges from mild (cool hand, numbness during dialysis) to severe (rest pain, tissue loss). More common with brachial artery access.",
