      "text": "Thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) is a minimally invasive approach to treat thoracic aortic pathology (aneurysm, dissection, trauma, ulcer) using stent-grafts delivered via femoral access. Compared to open repair, TEVAR offers reduced operative mortality, shorter ICU/hospital stay, and faster recovery, but requires specific anatomic criteria and lifelong surveillance.",
      "formal": "TEVAR: Endovascular repair of thoracic aorta; Indications: TAA ≥5.5-6cm, complicated Type B dissection, trauma, PAU; Access: femoral; Benefits: lower mortality vs open, faster recovery; Requires: adequate landing zones, surveillance"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "TEVAR is like lining the inside of a damaged pipe with a new inner sleeve, rather than cutting out the damaged section and replacing it. A compressed fabric-covered stent is threaded through blood vessels from the groin up to the chest, then expanded inside the aorta to seal off the aneurysm or cover a tear. The blood flows through the new 'sleeve' while the damaged aorta outside is excluded from pressure.",
      "key_insight": "TEVAR's success depends on adequate 'landing zones' - healthy aorta above and below the pathology where the device can seal. The left subclavian artery origin often limits proximal landing zone length. Coverage of the left subclavian is acceptable with revascularization in select patients, but should be avoided if possible due to stroke and arm ischemia risk.",
      "technical_details": "Device sizing is critical: 10-20% oversizing (depending on pathology). Landing zone requirements: typically ≥2cm of normal aorta. Zone 0-2 (arch) require branched/fenestrated devices or hybrid approaches. Zone 3-4 (descending) amenable to standard TEVAR. Spinal cord ischemia risk increases with coverage of lower thoracic aorta and if prior AAA repair (T8-L2 collateral network)."
