        "term": "Mechanism of Action",
        "description": "External compression reduces venous diameter → improves valve coaptation → reduces reflux → lowers ambulatory venous pressure → reduces edema and capillary leak → improves tissue oxygenation"

        "description": "Class 1 (15-20 mmHg): mild edema, prevention. Class 2 (20-30 mmHg): moderate CVI, post-ablation. Class 3 (30-40 mmHg): severe CVI, ulcers. Class 4 (40-50+ mmHg): lymphedema, severe edema"
