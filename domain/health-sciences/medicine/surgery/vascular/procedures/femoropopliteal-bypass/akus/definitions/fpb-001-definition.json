      {
        "term": "Conduit Preference",
        "description": "Autogenous great saphenous vein (GSV) is gold standard; significantly better patency than prosthetic, especially below-knee. If GSV unavailable: arm veins > prosthetic with vein cuff"

        "term": "Above-Knee vs Below-Knee",

        "description": "Reversed: vein removed, reversed to allow flow (valves don't obstruct); In-situ: vein left in place, valves lysed with valvulotome. Similar patency; in-situ may have better size match"
