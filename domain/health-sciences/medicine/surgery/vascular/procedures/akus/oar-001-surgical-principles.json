        "explanation": "Transperitoneal: midline laparotomy, full exposure, bilateral iliac access. Retroperitoneal: left flank incision, less fluid shifts, better for hostile abdomen. Thoracoabdominal: thoracoretroperitoneal incision for TAAA."

      {
        "concept": "Aortic Clamping Physiology",
        "explanation": "Cross-clamping increases afterload (SVR up 40%), preload, and MAP. Unclamping causes hypotension from reperfusion vasodilation and metabolite washout. Gradual release and volume loading mitigate hemodynamic swings."

        "concept": "Graft Selection",
        "explanation": "Dacron (polyester): most common, available in woven and knitted forms. Woven is stronger, knitted is more compliant. PTFE: alternative, lower porosity. Size: typically 1.5-2x normal aortic diameter."

      {
        "concept": "Intraoperative Adjuncts",
