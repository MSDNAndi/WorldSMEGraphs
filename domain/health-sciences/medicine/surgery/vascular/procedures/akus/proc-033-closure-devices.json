    "statement": {
      "text": "Vascular closure devices (VCDs) are mechanical systems designed to achieve hemostasis at arterial access sites, allowing faster patient ambulation and reduced compression time compared to manual compression. Major device categories include collagen-based (AngioSeal), suture-mediated (Perclose, ProGlide), and staple/clip-based (StarClose). Device selection depends on arteriotomy size, patient anatomy, anticoagulation status, and planned use (diagnostic vs interventional). Understanding device mechanisms, proper deployment, and complication management is essential.",
      "formal": "VCD Categories: Collagen-based (AngioSeal) - intravascular anchor + collagen plug | Suture-mediated (Perclose/ProGlide) - percutaneous suture deployment | Clip-based (StarClose) - extravascular clip | Selection: Device rated for sheath size, assess CFA suitability, consider anticoagulation | Benefit: Faster ambulation, reduced compression time"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Vascular closure devices are like different types of patches or stitches for the hole left after removing a catheter from an artery. Some devices plug the hole with a sealant (collagen), some sew it closed from the inside (suture devices), and some clip it from the outside (staple devices). The goal is the same - stop the bleeding faster than just pressing on it - but each device has its own way of doing it.",
      "key_insight": "Device selection should match the clinical scenario. Suture-mediated devices (Perclose/ProGlide) are the most versatile - they work with anticoagulation and can close large arteriotomies (up to 21F using 'preclose' technique). Collagen-based devices (AngioSeal) are reliable for standard 5-8F access. Understanding which device to use when is as important as knowing how to deploy it.",
      "technical_details": "Device Types and Mechanisms: (1) Collagen-based (AngioSeal): Intravascular biodegradable anchor positioned inside artery, collagen plug deposited on top, suture connects them and compresses vessel wall. Dissolves in 60-90 days. Sizes: 6F and 8F. (2) Suture-mediated (Perclose ProGlide): Deploys monofilament sutures percutaneously. Device enters artery, footplate deploys, needles pass suture through arterial wall, suture retrieved and tied extravascularly. Can be used for 'preclose' technique for large-bore access. Size: Up to 8F (single device), up to 21F+ (preclose with multiple devices). (3) Clip-based (StarClose SE): Extravascular nitinol clip crimps arteriotomy edges closed. Does not enter vessel lumen. Size: Up to 6F. Deployment Technique (Perclose example): (1) Maintain wire access; (2) Remove sheath; (3) Insert device over wire; (4) Advance until blood return from side port; (5) Deploy footplate; (6) Engage needles; (7) Retrieve suture tails; (8) Remove device; (9) Advance knot with pusher while applying traction.",

        "All closure devices are the same - each has different mechanisms, indications, and limitations",
        "VCDs can close any arteriotomy - each device is rated for specific sheath sizes",
        "VCDs are safer than manual compression - similar complication rates, but different types",
        "You can use VCDs in any CFA - disease, calcification, and prior closures affect success"
