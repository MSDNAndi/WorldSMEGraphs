    "statement": {
      "text": "Completion duplex ultrasound is a non-invasive intraoperative imaging technique used to assess vascular reconstructions, particularly vein bypasses. This modality provides real-time B-mode imaging of the graft and anastomoses plus Doppler velocity measurements to detect stenoses. Peak systolic velocity (PSV) >180 cm/s or velocity ratio >2.0 indicates a hemodynamically significant stenosis requiring revision. Completion duplex avoids radiation and contrast while providing functional flow data.",
      "formal": "Completion Duplex: Sterile ultrasound probe (7.5-10 MHz) → B-mode imaging (graft, anastomoses) → Doppler velocity measurements → Criteria: PSV >180 cm/s or ratio >2.0 = stenosis | No radiation, no contrast | Best for: Vein grafts, visible/palpable reconstructions"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Completion duplex is like doing an ultrasound to look at your bypass graft the same way you'd look at a baby in the womb - you're using sound waves to see the structure and measure how fast blood is flowing. If blood is moving too fast at one point, it means there's a narrowing there, just like water speeds up when you put your thumb over the end of a garden hose.",
      "key_insight": "The combination of anatomic (B-mode) and functional (Doppler velocity) data makes duplex uniquely valuable. Unlike angiography, which only shows anatomy, duplex tells you if a stenosis is actually affecting flow. A PSV >180 cm/s or velocity ratio >2.0 (compared to adjacent normal segment) is the threshold for hemodynamic significance that warrants revision.",
      "technical_details": "Technique: (1) Cover linear ultrasound probe (7.5-10 MHz) with sterile sheath; (2) Apply sterile saline or gel for acoustic coupling; (3) Scan entire graft from inflow to outflow; (4) Obtain B-mode images of proximal anastomosis, graft body, distal anastomosis; (5) Measure peak systolic velocity (PSV) at each anastomosis and any suspicious areas; (6) Calculate velocity ratio (PSV at stenosis / PSV in adjacent normal segment); (7) Assess graft diameter, wall abnormalities, intimal flaps; (8) For vein grafts, evaluate for retained valve leaflets, twist, or size mismatch. Criteria for revision: PSV >180-200 cm/s at focal stenosis, velocity ratio >2.0-2.5, visible intimal flap, B-mode diameter stenosis >50%.",

        "Duplex is only for surveillance, not completion studies - intraoperative duplex is highly accurate",
        "You need a dedicated ultrasound technician - surgeons can learn to perform and interpret",
        "Angiography is always better - duplex provides velocity data that angiography cannot",
