    "statement": {
      "text": "End-to-end anastomosis is the fundamental vascular surgical technique for joining two vessels or a graft to a vessel in a linear fashion. The technique involves spatulating the vessel ends for size match, placing precise intima-to-intima sutures, and creating a watertight, hemodynamically favorable connection. This anastomosis type is preferred for trauma repair, interposition grafts, and aortic procedures where the vessels are aligned on the same axis.",
      "formal": "End-to-End Anastomosis: Spatulate ends (45° bevel or longitudinal cut) → Match diameters → Place corner sutures → Running polypropylene (5-0 to 7-0 depending on vessel size) → Continuous technique (or interrupted for small vessels) → Flush before completion → Test anastomosis"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "An end-to-end anastomosis is like splicing two pieces of hose together - you're connecting them in a straight line. To make sure the connection doesn't leak and blood flows smoothly, you need to bevel the ends (like cutting bread on an angle), match them up perfectly, and sew them with tiny stitches that only catch the outside layer of each vessel.",
      "key_insight": "The key to a perfect end-to-end anastomosis is tension-free approximation with precise intima-to-intima contact. If there's any tension on the suture line, it will leak or the suture will cut through. If the intima isn't kissing, a flap can form and cause thrombosis. Spatulating the ends (making them oblique) widens the anastomosis and prevents stenosis.",
      "technical_details": "Technique: (1) Prepare vessel ends by debriding any damaged tissue; (2) Spatulate the ends by cutting obliquely (45°) or making a longitudinal incision to widen; (3) Match vessel diameters - the smaller vessel can be spatulated more to match larger; (4) Flush with heparinized saline; (5) Place first suture at heel (posterior) with mattress-type bite; (6) Run anterior wall first (or posterior if you're inside the vessel); (7) Use 3-4mm bites, 3-4mm apart; (8) Keep sutures perpendicular to vessel edge; (9) Take full-thickness bites but don't catch back wall; (10) Before completing, flush and back-bleed to remove air/debris; (11) Complete anastomosis; (12) Test by releasing clamps - proximal first, then distal. Suture selection: Aorta 3-0/4-0, femoral 5-0/6-0, tibial 6-0/7-0 polypropylene.",
      "common_misconceptions": [
        "You can sew through all layers and it will be fine - intima-to-intima contact is essential for healing",
        "Bigger bites are stronger - smaller, precise bites prevent tearing and stenosis",
        "You need interrupted sutures for all anastomoses - running technique is faster and usually equivalent",
        "If it's leaking, just put more sutures - first try applying pressure, as sutures weaken the anastomosis"
