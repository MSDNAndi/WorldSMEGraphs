    "statement": {
      "text": "Axillobifemoral bypass is an extra-anatomic bypass procedure that provides blood flow from the axillary artery to both femoral arteries without entering the abdomen. This procedure is reserved for patients with aortoiliac occlusive disease who are too high-risk for direct aortic reconstruction. The bypass utilizes a prosthetic graft (typically PTFE) tunneled subcutaneously along the lateral chest wall and abdomen, with a femorofemoral crossover graft to perfuse both legs.",
      "formal": "Axillobifemoral Bypass: Axillary artery (1st portion) exposure → Femoral artery exposure (bilateral) → PTFE graft anastomosis (end-to-side axillary) → Subcutaneous tunnel lateral chest/abdomen → Femoral anastomosis (end-to-side or end-to-end) → Femorofemoral crossover | Indications: High-risk aortoiliac disease, hostile abdomen, infected aortic graft"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "When you can't rebuild the main highway (the aorta), you build a bypass road around it. Axillobifemoral bypass takes blood from an artery in the shoulder area and routes it down the side of the body in a plastic tube under the skin, then splits it to both legs. It's like building a detour around a blocked highway - not as durable as fixing the main road, but it works when you can't access the main route.",
      "key_insight": "Axillobifemoral bypass is the quintessential bailout procedure - it's what you do when you can't do the right operation (aortobifemoral bypass). Patency rates are inferior (60-70% at 5 years vs 85-90% for ABF), but the key is selecting patients who truly can't tolerate the bigger operation. It also saves lives in infected aortic graft situations.",
      "technical_details": "Technique: (1) Position patient supine with ipsilateral arm abducted 90°; (2) Expose axillary artery (first portion, medial to pectoralis minor) through infraclavicular incision; (3) Expose both femoral arteries through vertical groin incisions; (4) Create subcutaneous tunnel from axilla along midaxillary line, anterior abdominal wall, to ipsilateral groin; (5) Use long tunneling instrument or tube; (6) Pass 8mm ringed PTFE graft through tunnel; (7) Anastomose end-to-side to axillary artery; (8) Anastomose end-to-side to ipsilateral femoral artery; (9) Create subcutaneous tunnel through suprapubic area to contralateral groin; (10) Anastomose 6-8mm PTFE femorofemoral graft end-to-side to both femoral arteries (or make T-junction at ipsilateral anastomosis). Graft selection: 8mm axillofemoral limb, 6-8mm femorofemoral limb, externally supported (ringed) to prevent compression.",
      "common_misconceptions": [
        "Axillobifemoral bypass is as good as aortobifemoral - patency is significantly inferior",
        "Any patient can have this procedure - the axillary artery must have good inflow (check subclavian)",
        "The graft can be placed anywhere under the skin - routing matters to prevent kinking and compression",
        "It's a simple procedure - the tunneling and graft management require careful technique"
