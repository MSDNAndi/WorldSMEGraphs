    "statement": {
      "text": "Ultrasound-guided arterial access uses real-time imaging to guide needle puncture of the target artery, typically the common femoral artery (CFA). This technique reduces access complications compared to landmark-based puncture by allowing visualization of vessel anatomy, calcification, plaque, and adjacent structures. Studies demonstrate 50-70% reduction in access site complications with ultrasound guidance. The technique is now considered standard of care for all percutaneous vascular access.",
      "formal": "US-Guided Access: Linear probe (7.5-10 MHz) → Identify CFA (above bifurcation, below inguinal ligament) → Visualize needle entry in real-time → Confirm intraluminal position → Wire insertion | Benefits: 50-70% reduction in access complications | Standard of care for percutaneous vascular procedures"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Using ultrasound for arterial access is like turning on the lights before you walk into a dark room. Instead of feeling around blindly for the artery (the old way), you can actually SEE exactly where the artery is, where the vein is, where the calcified plaque is, and guide your needle directly into the right spot. It's like having X-ray vision for blood vessels.",
      "key_insight": "The common femoral artery is the only safe zone for percutaneous access. Above the inguinal ligament is the external iliac artery (can't compress against bone, retroperitoneal bleed risk). Below the bifurcation, you hit the SFA or profunda (poor compression). Ultrasound shows you exactly where the bifurcation is so you can hit the sweet spot.",
      "technical_details": "Technique: (1) Position patient supine with leg slightly abducted and externally rotated; (2) Apply sterile prep and drape; (3) Cover linear ultrasound probe (7.5-10 MHz) with sterile sheath; (4) Identify common femoral artery in transverse view; (5) Confirm you are above the bifurcation (CFA should be single vessel); (6) Note location of CFA relative to femoral vein (lateral) and femoral head (posterior landmark); (7) Assess for anterior wall calcification or plaque (avoid puncture through plaque); (8) Choose anterior wall clear of disease; (9) Switch to longitudinal view or stay transverse; (10) Introduce needle at 45° angle under real-time visualization; (11) Observe needle tip entering vessel; (12) Confirm pulsatile blood return; (13) Advance wire under fluoroscopic guidance. Two techniques: 'Out-of-plane' (transverse view, see needle as dot) or 'In-plane' (longitudinal view, see entire needle shaft).",

        "Ultrasound takes too long - adds only 1-2 minutes once skilled",
