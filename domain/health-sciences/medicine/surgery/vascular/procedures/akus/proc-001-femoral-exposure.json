    "statement": {
      "text": "Femoral artery exposure is the most fundamental vascular surgery technique, providing access to the common femoral artery (CFA), superficial femoral artery (SFA), and profunda femoris artery (PFA). This exposure serves as the foundation for bypass grafting, endarterectomy, embolectomy, and endovascular access. Mastery of femoral exposure anatomy is essential for all vascular surgeons.",
      "formal": "Femoral Exposure: Vertical/oblique groin incision → CFA/SFA/PFA exposure → Circumferential dissection with vessel loops | Landmarks: Inguinal ligament, femoral pulse, sartorius | Critical: Femoral vein medial, profunda posterolateral | Applications: Bypass, endarterectomy, embolectomy, endovascular"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Think of femoral exposure as accessing the main highway junction of the leg's blood supply. The common femoral artery is like a major interstate that splits into two roads - the superficial femoral going down the front of the thigh to the knee, and the profunda going deep into the thigh muscles. Surgeons need to access this junction safely while avoiding the vein that runs right next to it.",
      "key_insight": "The femoral artery is the most commonly accessed artery in vascular surgery because it's relatively superficial, large enough to work with, and sits at a key anatomic junction. However, complications can be devastating - injury to the femoral vein can cause severe bleeding, lymphatic disruption leads to troublesome wound problems, and the femoral nerve controls thigh sensation and strength.",
      "technical_details": "Technique: (1) Patient supine with leg externally rotated; (2) Incision: vertical or oblique 2 fingerbreadths below inguinal ligament, centered on femoral pulse; (3) Divide subcutaneous tissue and Scarpa's fascia; (4) Identify and preserve lymphatics when possible; (5) Incise femoral sheath longitudinally; (6) Dissect CFA circumferentially; (7) Trace distally to identify SFA/PFA bifurcation; (8) PFA takeoff is posterolateral, typically 3-5cm below inguinal ligament; (9) Lateral circumflex iliac vein crosses field - ligate if needed; (10) Place vessel loops on CFA, SFA, PFA for control. The SFA is more anterior and superficial; PFA dives deep and posteriorly. The profunda branches (lateral circumflex, medial circumflex) may require additional dissection.",
      "common_misconceptions": [
        "The SFA is the main blood supply to the leg - the PFA is often more important, especially in occlusive disease",
        "Femoral exposure is easy because the artery is superficial - proper tissue handling to avoid lymphatic complications requires skill",
        "A bigger incision is always better - excessive dissection increases lymphatic complications",
        "The femoral vein is always medial - anatomic variations occur, especially with scarred groins"
