    "statement": {
      "text": "Transperitoneal aortic exposure through a midline laparotomy is the classic approach to the infrarenal aorta. The technique requires retracting the small bowel, mobilizing the duodenum (Kocher maneuver equivalent), and incising the retroperitoneal ligament of Treitz to expose the aorta from the left renal vein to the iliac bifurcation. This approach provides excellent exposure of both iliac arteries and allows concomitant intraperitoneal procedures.",
      "formal": "Transperitoneal Exposure: Midline laparotomy → Eviscerate/retract small bowel → Incise retroperitoneum over aorta → Identify left renal vein (proximal landmark) → Expose infrarenal aorta → Control iliacs | Advantages: Familiar anatomy, bilateral iliac access, concurrent procedures | Disadvantages: Bowel manipulation, ileus, adhesion potential"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "The transperitoneal approach is like opening the hood of a car to work on the engine - you're lifting everything out of the way to see the main structure underneath. The intestines are moved aside (or wrapped up and placed on the chest), and you cut through the tissue covering the aorta to expose it. It's more invasive but gives you a great view of everything.",
      "key_insight": "The left renal vein crossing the aorta is your proximal landmark for infrarenal aortic exposure. Find this vein and you know exactly where your proximal clamp can go safely above it. The vein can be ligated if needed (as long as the gonadal and adrenal tributaries are preserved), but try to avoid it as it can cause renal vein hypertension.",
      "technical_details": "Technique: (1) Midline incision from xiphoid to pubis; (2) Enter peritoneum; (3) Eviscerate small bowel to right, wrap in moist towel or place in bowel bag; (4) Retract transverse colon superiorly; (5) Incise retroperitoneum over aorta, starting at level of ligament of Treitz; (6) Extend incision from left renal vein to bifurcation; (7) Identify left renal vein crossing aorta anteriorly; (8) Control aorta below left renal vein; (9) Ligate and divide lumbar veins for circumferential control; (10) Identify and preserve inferior mesenteric artery (divide if needed); (11) Expose iliac arteries by extending retroperitoneal incision; (12) Identify and protect ureters. For suprarenal control: Mobilize left renal vein, divide if needed, expose suprarenal aorta.",
      "common_misconceptions": [
        "You always need to ligate the left renal vein for exposure - usually you can work around it",
        "The IMA must be preserved - it can be ligated if collaterals are adequate",
        "Transperitoneal approach has worse outcomes - outcomes are similar to retroperitoneal",
        "Ileus is unavoidable - gentle handling and early feeding minimize duration"
