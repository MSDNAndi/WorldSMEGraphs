      "intuition": "When a segment of artery is damaged or diseased and can't be fixed directly, you cut out the bad part and sew in a replacement piece - like splicing in a new section of pipe.",
      "key_insight": "Interposition grafts are inline reconstructions requiring two end-to-end anastomoses. They're ideal when native vessel alignment is preserved. Vein is preferred for peripheral arteries; prosthetic is acceptable for large vessels.",
      "technical_details": "Indications: trauma with >2cm defect, aneurysm, infected pseudoaneurysm, iatrogenic injury. Conduit selection: autogenous vein (preferred for small/medium arteries), prosthetic (acceptable for aorta, iliac, femoral). Technique: resect diseased segment, measure defect, harvest appropriate length conduit, proximal then distal end-to-end anastomosis. Orientation: reversed vein or in situ for matched diameter. Tension: conduit slightly longer than defect to avoid tension."
