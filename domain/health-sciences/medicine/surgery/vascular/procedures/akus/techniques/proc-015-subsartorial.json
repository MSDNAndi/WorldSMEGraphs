      "text": "The subsartorial (Hunter's canal) tunnel is the anatomic route through the adductor canal used for bypass graft placement from the femoral to above-knee popliteal artery, protecting the graft with overlying muscle.",
      "formal": "Subsartorial_Tunnel: Femoral → Adductor_Canal → AK_Popliteal_Artery"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "The adductor canal is nature's built-in highway for blood vessels from the groin to the knee. When you place a bypass graft, using this natural tunnel keeps the graft protected by surrounding muscles rather than exposed just under the skin.",
      "key_insight": "Anatomic tunneling through the subsartorial canal provides graft protection and follows the native arterial path. It's preferred over subcutaneous routing for femoral-popliteal bypass.",
      "technical_details": "Anatomy: bounded by vastus medialis (lateral), adductor longus/magnus (medial/posterior), sartorius (anterior roof). Contents: femoral vessels, saphenous nerve. Technique: tunneler passed from groin incision to popliteal exposure, under sartorius muscle. Graft: pulled through tunnel without twisting or kinking. Endpoint: above-knee popliteal artery (AK pop) in medial approach. Note: for below-knee popliteal, continue through adductor hiatus into popliteal fossa."
