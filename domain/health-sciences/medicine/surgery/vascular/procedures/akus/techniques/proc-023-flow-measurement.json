      "text": "Intraoperative flow measurement using transit-time ultrasound flowmetry quantifies graft or native vessel blood flow, helping detect technical errors and predict graft patency with flows >100mL/min in peripheral bypasses generally associated with good outcomes.",

    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Flow measurement is like checking the speedometer of blood through your new bypass. If blood is flowing fast and freely (high mL/min), the repair is working well. Low flow suggests a problem that needs fixing before you close.",
      "key_insight": "Transit-time flowmetry provides objective flow data that complements visual assessment. Flows below 100mL/min in peripheral bypasses or below 800mL/min in dialysis access should prompt investigation for technical problems.",
      "technical_details": "Technology: transit-time ultrasound uses probe around vessel; measures time for ultrasound pulse to traverse flowing blood. Advantages: non-invasive, real-time, quantitative. Normal values: peripheral bypass >100mL/min, dialysis access >800mL/min, coronary bypass >30mL/min. Applications: detecting kinks, twists, anastomotic stenosis, competitive flow. Limitations: doesn't identify the specific problem, just alerts to low flow."
