    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "The great saphenous vein is the gold standard for bypass grafts. Harvesting it is like carefully removing a garden hose from the ground - you want to take it out intact, without kinking, stretching, or poking holes in it.",
      "key_insight": "Vein quality determines graft patency. Surgical injury (intimal trauma, excessive dilation, prolonged ischemia) compromises the conduit. Gentle handling, minimal dilation, and careful branch ligation preserve endothelial integrity.",
      "technical_details": "Preoperative: duplex vein mapping for diameter (≥3mm preferred), continuity, and course. Open technique: continuous or skip incisions over mapped vein. Endoscopic: smaller incisions, camera-assisted, similar patency when properly performed. Handling: minimal grasping, gentle dilation (max 500mmHg), ligate branches close to vein. Preservation: heparinized blood or balanced salt solution, avoid cold storage. Orientation: mark for non-reversed use to avoid improper valve direction."
