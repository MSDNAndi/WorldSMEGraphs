  "content": {
    "statement": {
      "text": "Anatomic bypass follows the native arterial pathway while extra-anatomic bypass routes the graft through non-anatomic tissue planes, with anatomic generally preferred for durability and extra-anatomic used for hostile abdomens or infection.",

    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Anatomic bypass is like rebuilding the same highway in the same location - it's durable but requires going through the usual territory (abdomen). Extra-anatomic is like building an alternate route around a problem area - less direct but avoids trouble spots.",
      "key_insight": "Anatomic bypasses (aortofemoral, aortoiliac) have superior long-term patency (90% at 5 years) but require abdominal surgery. Extra-anatomic bypasses (axillo-femoral, fem-fem) avoid the abdomen but have lower patency (50-70% at 5 years).",
      "technical_details": "Anatomic examples: aortobifemoral, aortoiliac, femoral-popliteal in Hunter's canal. Extra-anatomic examples: axillobifemoral, femorofemoral, obturator bypass. Indications for extra-anatomic: hostile abdomen, severe cardiac risk, infected aortic graft, aortoenteric fistula. Patency: anatomic 85-90% at 5 years, axillofemoral 50-70%, femfem 70-85%."
