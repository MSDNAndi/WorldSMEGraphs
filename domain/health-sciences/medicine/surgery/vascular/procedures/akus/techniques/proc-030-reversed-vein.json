    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Veins have one-way valves that prevent backflow. To use a vein as an artery bypass, you can simply flip it upside down - now arterial blood pushes the valves open instead of closed. The tradeoff is the small end is now at the big artery.",
      "key_insight": "Reversed vein is technically simpler than in situ (no valvulotome needed) and has similar patency. The size mismatch is accepted; some surgeons prefer a larger conduit at the distal anastomosis where it's most critical.",
      "technical_details": "Technique: harvest GSV, reverse orientation (small/distal end becomes proximal), tunnel to target, anastomose. Advantages: technically simple, no valvulotome, all side branches ligated at harvest. Disadvantages: size mismatch (small end at femoral, large end at tibial), more handling injury. Patency: equivalent to in situ in randomized trials. Orientation check: flow direction, identify marked end."
