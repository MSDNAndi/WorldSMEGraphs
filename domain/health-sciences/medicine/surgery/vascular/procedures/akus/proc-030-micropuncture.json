    "statement": {
      "text": "Micropuncture technique uses a small-gauge (21G) needle and 0.018-inch wire for initial arterial access, which is then exchanged for standard equipment after confirming intraluminal position. This approach minimizes arteriotomy size, reduces bleeding from inadvertent venipuncture or failed attempts, and is particularly valuable when accessing small arteries (radial, brachial), calcified vessels, or anticoagulated patients. The technique involves initial 21G puncture, 0.018-inch wire advancement, coaxial dilator/sheath exchange, then upgrading to standard 0.035-inch system.",
      "formal": "Micropuncture Technique: 21G needle → 0.018-inch wire → 4-5F coaxial dilator (inner 0.018, outer 0.035) → Exchange to standard system | Benefits: Smaller initial arteriotomy, reduced bleeding from failed attempts | Best for: Small arteries, calcified vessels, anticoagulated patients"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Micropuncture is like using a tiny pilot hole before drilling a larger hole. Instead of starting with a big needle that makes a big hole (which bleeds a lot if you miss), you start with a tiny needle that makes a tiny hole. If you're in the wrong place, no big deal - it's a small hole. Once you confirm you're in the right spot with a tiny wire, then you upgrade to the bigger equipment.",
      "key_insight": "The micropuncture advantage is damage control. A 21G needle makes a hole about 0.8mm in diameter; an 18G needle makes a 1.2mm hole. If you accidentally puncture the back wall of the artery or hit the vein instead, the small hole seals much faster. This is especially important when the patient is on blood thinners or when you're accessing a small artery where any hole is proportionally larger.",
      "technical_details": "Technique: (1) Prepare access site with sterile prep/drape; (2) Administer local anesthesia; (3) Use ultrasound guidance (recommended); (4) Puncture artery with 21G micropuncture needle (short bevel, 7cm length typically); (5) Confirm pulsatile arterial return; (6) Advance 0.018-inch platinum-tipped wire through needle; (7) Confirm wire position with fluoroscopy (should advance freely without resistance); (8) Remove needle over wire; (9) Advance transitional coaxial dilator (4F or 5F outer, accepts 0.018 wire through inner dilator); (10) Remove inner dilator with 0.018 wire, leaving outer dilator in place; (11) Outer dilator now accepts 0.035-inch standard wire; (12) Exchange for standard sheath/equipment over 0.035 wire. Key: If wire doesn't advance freely, do NOT force - you may be subintimal or in branch vessel.",
      "common_misconceptions": [
        "Micropuncture is only for small arteries - it's valuable for all access, especially high-risk",
        "The 21G needle is too small to feel - technique is similar to standard access",
        "The extra exchange steps take too long - adds only 30-60 seconds",
        "Standard 18G access is just as safe - micropuncture has proven complication reduction"
