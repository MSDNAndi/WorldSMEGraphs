    "statement": {
      "text": "Sartorius muscle flap is a tissue transposition technique used to cover and protect vascular grafts in the groin when wound complications occur or are anticipated. The sartorius muscle is mobilized from its origin at the anterior superior iliac spine (ASIS), rotated medially, and sutured over the femoral vessels and anastomoses. This provides vascularized tissue coverage that promotes healing, protects against graft exposure, and may help contain localized infection.",
      "formal": "Sartorius Flap: Detach muscle from ASIS origin → Preserve distal blood supply (femoral artery branches) → Rotate medially over femoral vessels → Suture to inguinal ligament/adductor fascia | Indications: Groin wound dehiscence, graft exposure, prophylactic coverage | Function: Provides vascularized tissue over graft"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "The sartorius muscle is like a built-in bandage that's already in the neighborhood. It's a long, strap-like muscle on the front of your thigh that you can disconnect at the top and swing over to cover the blood vessels in the groin, like flipping a blanket over something you want to protect. Because it has its own blood supply from below, it stays alive and brings healing power to the area.",
      "key_insight": "The sartorius flap is your go-to salvage maneuver when a groin wound is failing. It's reliable, easy to perform, and doesn't require microsurgical expertise. The key is detaching only the origin (at the ASIS) while preserving the segmental blood supply from branches of the femoral artery entering the muscle from below.",
      "technical_details": "Technique: (1) Extend groin incision laterally if needed; (2) Identify sartorius muscle at the lateral border of the femoral triangle; (3) Identify the anterior superior iliac spine (ASIS); (4) Incise the fascia along the lateral border of sartorius; (5) Develop a plane under the muscle, preserving segmental blood supply from femoral artery perforators; (6) Divide the origin of sartorius at the ASIS (be careful of lateral femoral cutaneous nerve); (7) Rotate the muscle medially over the femoral vessels; (8) Suture the muscle to the inguinal ligament superiorly and adductor fascia medially using absorbable sutures; (9) The muscle should comfortably cover the femoral artery and graft; (10) Close skin if possible, or use negative pressure wound therapy if needed.",
      "common_misconceptions": [
        "You need to detach both ends of the muscle - only detach the origin, preserve distal attachments",
        "The muscle will die after transposition - it has segmental blood supply that is preserved",
        "This is only for infected wounds - prophylactic use in high-risk patients is common",
        "Any groin wound needs a sartorius flap - most wounds heal primarily, flap is for problems"
