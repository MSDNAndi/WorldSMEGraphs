    "statement": {
      "text": "Large bore arterial access refers to percutaneous or surgical access using sheaths typically 12-24F for procedures such as transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR), endovascular aortic repair (EVAR), and percutaneous ventricular assist devices. Successful large bore access requires careful preoperative planning including iliofemoral assessment (CT angiography), appropriate patient selection, and expertise in both access and closure techniques. The 'preclose' technique using suture-mediated devices enables percutaneous closure of large arteriotomies.",
      "formal": "Large Bore Access: Preoperative CTA for iliofemoral assessment → Minimum diameter criteria (TAVR: 5-5.5mm, EVAR: varies by device) → Ultrasound-guided access → Preclose with 2 ProGlide devices (perpendicular orientation) → Serial dilation → Insert large sheath → Complete procedure → Remove sheath → Tie preclose sutures | Alternative: Surgical cutdown if anatomy unfavorable"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Large bore access is like trying to park a big truck in a small garage - you need to make sure the road (your arteries) is wide enough, straight enough, and smooth enough for the truck (the large sheath) to get through without causing damage. The preclose technique is like putting stitches in the garage door frame BEFORE the truck goes through, so you can easily sew it back together after.",
      "key_insight": "The key to successful large bore access is patient selection. A patient with a 6mm diameter calcified, tortuous iliac artery is a setup for disaster with an 18F TAVR sheath. Preprocedural CT angiography is mandatory to measure vessel diameters, assess calcification, and plan the approach. Sometimes the right answer is 'don't do it percutaneously.'",
      "technical_details": "Preprocedure Planning: (1) CT angiography of iliofemoral system; (2) Measure minimum vessel diameter (at narrowest point, not just at access site); (3) Assess calcification (circumferential calcium is high-risk); (4) Assess tortuosity (severe angulation may prevent device delivery); (5) Rule out occlusive disease, aneurysm, or prior stents. Access Technique: (1) Ultrasound-guided CFA puncture; (2) Confirm CFA position with angiography through small sheath; (3) Deploy two ProGlide devices at 10-2 o'clock and 4-8 o'clock orientations; (4) Secure sutures outside skin without tying; (5) Exchange for stiff wire (e.g., Lunderquist, Amplatz Super Stiff); (6) Serial dilation if needed; (7) Advance large sheath; (8) Complete procedure; (9) Remove sheath over wire (maintain access); (10) Tie preclose sutures; (11) Confirm hemostasis angiographically if needed. Minimum Diameters: TAVR 14-18F typically requires ≥5.5mm, EVAR varies by device manufacturer (check IFU).",
