    "statement": {
      "text": "Femorofemoral bypass (crossover graft) is an extra-anatomic bypass that utilizes the donor iliac system to perfuse the contralateral leg in patients with unilateral iliac occlusive disease. The graft is tunneled subcutaneously across the suprapubic area, connecting the two common femoral arteries. This procedure offers excellent patency (75-85% at 5 years) with minimal physiologic stress, making it ideal for high-risk patients with isolated unilateral iliac disease.",
      "formal": "Femorofemoral Bypass: Bilateral femoral exposure → Suprapubic tunnel (subcutaneous) → 6-8mm PTFE or ringed PTFE → End-to-side donor femoral → End-to-side recipient femoral | Prerequisite: Adequate donor iliac inflow | Outcome: 75-85% 5-year patency"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Imagine one highway to your leg is blocked, but the other one is wide open. Femorofemoral bypass is like building a connecting road between the two sides so traffic from the good highway can reach both destinations. You're essentially stealing blood from the good side to supply the bad side - but there's usually plenty to go around.",
      "key_insight": "The success of femorofemoral bypass depends entirely on the donor iliac artery. If there's any stenosis in the donor iliac, the bypass will fail AND you might cause symptoms on the donor leg (steal phenomenon). Always evaluate the donor iliac with imaging or pressure measurements before committing to this procedure.",
      "technical_details": "Technique: (1) Patient supine, legs slightly abducted; (2) Make bilateral vertical groin incisions; (3) Expose common femoral arteries bilaterally; (4) Assess donor artery inflow (palpable pulse, Doppler, or direct pressure measurement); (5) Create subcutaneous tunnel through suprapubic area (above rectus fascia, below Scarpa's fascia); (6) Use tunneling instrument, stay superficial to avoid bladder/bowel; (7) Pass 6-8mm PTFE graft through tunnel (externally supported preferred); (8) Perform donor side anastomosis first (end-to-side); (9) Clamp graft, flush; (10) Perform recipient side anastomosis (end-to-side); (11) Release clamps, assess flow with Doppler/palpation. Graft configuration: Curving 'C' or gentle 'U' shape to prevent kinking at pubic area.",
      "common_misconceptions": [
        "Any patent femoral pulse can serve as donor - need to assess iliac inflow quality",
        "The graft should go straight across - a gentle curve prevents kinking at the pubis",
        "PTFE is the only option - vein can be used if available (rarely done)",
        "This is a temporary solution - with proper selection, long-term patency is excellent"
