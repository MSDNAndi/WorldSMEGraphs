    "statement": {
      "text": "Completion angiography is an intraoperative imaging technique performed at the end of a vascular reconstruction to identify technical errors before wound closure. This quality control measure involves injecting contrast through the bypass graft or arterial reconstruction and obtaining fluoroscopic images to assess anastomotic patency, identify stenoses, confirm runoff adequacy, and detect intimal flaps or thrombus. Studies demonstrate that completion imaging detects actionable findings in 5-15% of cases.",
      "formal": "Completion Angiography: Puncture graft/artery proximal to reconstruction → Inject iodinated contrast → Fluoroscopic imaging of anastomoses and runoff → Assess: patency, stenosis, intimal flap, thrombus, runoff | Detection rate: 5-15% actionable findings | Impact: Reduces early graft failure"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Completion angiography is like doing a final inspection before you close up the hood of a car after a repair. You're checking your work to make sure everything is connected properly, there are no leaks or blockages, and the blood (like fuel in a car) can flow where it needs to go. Finding a problem now is much easier than finding it after the patient leaves the OR.",
      "key_insight": "The value of completion imaging is in preventing early graft failure. Technical errors (intimal flaps, anastomotic stenosis, retained thrombus) cause 50-70% of early bypass failures. Fixing these problems intraoperatively takes minutes; coming back for a failed graft takes hours and has worse outcomes. The radiation and contrast exposure is minimal compared to the benefit.",
      "technical_details": "Technique: (1) Complete all anastomoses and restore flow; (2) Prepare C-arm fluoroscopy with digital subtraction capability; (3) Choose access site: directly puncture graft, insert needle through graft hood, or place catheter antegrade; (4) Use 18-gauge needle or micropuncture system; (5) Connect to contrast injector or syringe; (6) Position C-arm for optimal view (AP, obliques as needed); (7) Inject contrast (10-20cc iodinated contrast for hand injection, more for power injection); (8) Acquire digital subtraction images during injection; (9) Image entire reconstruction from inflow to runoff; (10) Assess: inflow, proximal anastomosis, graft body, distal anastomosis, runoff vessels. Interpretation: Look for filling defects (thrombus, intimal flap), stenosis (>30% narrowing concerning), kinks, and adequacy of runoff.",

        "If the pulse feels good, you don't need imaging - palpable pulse doesn't rule out significant stenosis",

        "Finding a problem means the operation failed - finding and fixing it is a success",
