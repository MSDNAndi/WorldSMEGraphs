    "description": "Vascular stents mounted on balloon catheters that expand when balloon is inflated, typically made from stainless steel or cobalt-chromium alloy.",
    "mechanism": "Stent plastically deforms when balloon inflated, maintaining expanded diameter after balloon deflation.",
    "characteristics": {
      "radial_force": "High initial radial force, excellent for calcified lesions",
      "precision": "Precise placement possible",
      "sizing": "Sized 1:1 with reference vessel",

    "advantages": [
      "Precise positioning",
      "Can be further expanded with larger balloon",
      "Better in calcified vessels",
      "Higher immediate radial force"
