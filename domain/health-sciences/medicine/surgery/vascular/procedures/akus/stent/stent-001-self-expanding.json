    "title": "Self-Expanding Stents",
    "description": "Vascular stents that expand to vessel diameter upon deployment, made from nitinol (nickel-titanium alloy) with shape memory properties.",
    "mechanism": "Nitinol's shape memory allows stent to be constrained during delivery and expand to predetermined diameter at body temperature.",
    "characteristics": {
      "radial_force": "Chronic outward force resists external compression",
      "flexibility": "Conforms to vessel tortuosity",
      "sizing": "Typically oversized 10-20% to vessel diameter",
      "length": "Available in various lengths"
    },
    "indications": [
      "Vessels subject to external compression (SFA, popliteal)",
      "Tortuous anatomy",
      "Long lesions",
      "Vessels with significant size mismatch"

    "types": {
      "laser_cut": "More precise cell geometry",
      "braided": "Higher flexibility, good for curves",
      "interwoven": "Enhanced fracture resistance"
    },
    "deployment_technique": "Positioned under fluoroscopy, unsheathed to allow controlled expansion",
    "limitations": [
      "Cannot be post-dilated to larger diameter",
      "May not fully expand in calcified lesions",
      "Precise positioning more difficult than balloon-expandable"
