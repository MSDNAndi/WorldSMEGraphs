    "statement": {
      "text": "End-to-side anastomosis is the most commonly used vascular anastomosis technique for bypass surgery, joining the end of a graft or vessel to the side of another vessel. This technique preserves flow in the native vessel while providing additional inflow or outflow. The anastomosis requires an arteriotomy matched to the graft diameter, precise heel-and-toe suturing, and attention to geometry to prevent kinking or flow disturbance.",
      "formal": "End-to-Side Anastomosis: Arteriotomy (length = 1.5x graft diameter) → Bevel graft end (45-60°) → Place heel suture first → Run continuous suture around → Complete at toe | Geometry: 30-45° angle from vessel, avoid acute angles | Critical: Match diameters, prevent kinking, intima-to-intima contact"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "An end-to-side anastomosis is like connecting a garden hose to the side of a main water pipe - you cut a hole in the pipe and attach the hose at an angle. This lets water continue flowing through the main pipe while also going into the hose. The angle matters because if you connect it too sharply, flow gets disrupted and turbulent.",
      "key_insight": "The geometry of the end-to-side anastomosis determines its long-term patency. The graft should come off at a 30-45° angle - too acute causes turbulence at the heel, too obtuse causes turbulence at the toe. The arteriotomy length should be about 1.5 times the graft diameter to prevent stenosis, and the graft should be beveled to match this length.",
      "technical_details": "Technique: (1) Clamp vessel proximal and distal to intended anastomosis site; (2) Make longitudinal arteriotomy (length = 1.5x graft diameter); (3) May extend with Potts scissors; (4) Bevel graft end to 45-60° angle; (5) Place first suture at heel with inside-out/outside-in mattress; (6) Run suture along one side to toe; (7) Place second arm of suture; (8) Run along other side to meet first at toe; (9) Before completing, flush graft and back-bleed; (10) Tie at toe; (11) Release clamps (distal first, then proximal for outflow; proximal first for inflow); (12) Check hemostasis and anastomosis geometry. Alternative: Parachute technique for deep locations - place all sutures first, then slide graft down.",
      "common_misconceptions": [
        "Bigger arteriotomy is better - too long causes stenosis, too short causes high velocity and turbulence",
        "The angle doesn't matter - acute angles cause flow separation and intimal hyperplasia",
        "You should always come off at 90° - 30-45° angle provides optimal hemodynamics",
        "Interrupted sutures are always better - running technique is faster and usually equivalent"
