    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "The axillary artery runs under your collarbone and pectoralis muscles to your arm. To reach it, you make a cut below the clavicle and split the chest muscles. The nerve bundles to the arm surround this artery, so you must work carefully.",
      "key_insight": "The three cords of the brachial plexus (lateral, medial, posterior) are named for their relationship to the axillary artery. They must be identified and protected during dissection to prevent devastating upper extremity neurologic injury.",
      "technical_details": "Incision: 2cm below and parallel to clavicle, starting at deltopectoral groove. Divide: pectoralis major (split fibers or detach), pectoralis minor (divide insertion on coracoid). Anatomy: axillary artery divided into 3 segments by pectoralis minor. Brachial plexus: lateral cord (lateral to artery), medial cord (medial), posterior cord (posterior). Veins: axillary vein inferior to artery. Control: proximal on subclavian via supraclavicular exposure if needed."
