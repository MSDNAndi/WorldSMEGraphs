    "statement": {
      "text": "Subclavian artery exposure provides access to the first and second portions of this major upper extremity and brachiocephalic vessel. The supraclavicular approach exposes the distal subclavian artery through an incision above the clavicle, requiring careful management of the phrenic nerve, brachial plexus, and thoracic duct. The infraclavicular approach provides access to the third portion (axillary artery). More extensive exposure may require clavicular resection or thoracotomy for the innominate origin.",
      "formal": "Subclavian Exposure: Supraclavicular (incision above clavicle, divide scalene fat pad, anterior scalene muscle, identify artery behind scalenus anticus) | Infraclavicular (deltopectoral approach to axillary artery) | Critical: Phrenic nerve (on anterior scalene), brachial plexus (posterior/superior), thoracic duct (left side at venous angle)"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "The subclavian artery is the main highway from the chest to the arm, running behind the clavicle like a tunnel under a bridge. The supraclavicular approach is like coming down from above to access the tunnel entrance - you have to navigate around important 'cables' (the phrenic nerve to the diaphragm) and 'power lines' (the brachial plexus to the arm). The infraclavicular approach accesses the tunnel exit below the clavicle where it becomes the axillary artery.",
      "key_insight": "The key to safe subclavian exposure is understanding the scalene triangle - the artery runs behind the anterior scalene muscle, the phrenic nerve runs ON the anterior scalene (don't cut the muscle before identifying the nerve), and the brachial plexus is posterior and superior. On the left side, you must also be aware of the thoracic duct.",
      "technical_details": "Supraclavicular Approach: (1) Patient supine, head turned away, roll under shoulders; (2) Transverse incision 1-2cm above clavicle; (3) Divide platysma, clavicular head of SCM if needed; (4) Identify and retract external jugular vein; (5) Divide scalene fat pad (contains transverse cervical vessels); (6) Identify phrenic nerve on anterior scalene surface; (7) Mobilize and protect phrenic nerve; (8) Divide anterior scalene muscle; (9) Expose subclavian artery; (10) Identify vertebral artery origin, internal thoracic artery origin. Left-sided: Identify and ligate thoracic duct if encountered. Extended exposure: (1) Divide clavicle or resect medial portion; (2) Ligate subclavian vein if needed; (3) For more proximal control, median sternotomy may be required.",
      "common_misconceptions": [
        "You can divide the anterior scalene without finding the phrenic nerve - this causes diaphragm paralysis",
        "The thoracic duct is only on the left - 80% left, but can be right or bilateral",
        "Clavicle resection is always needed - supraclavicular approach provides good exposure for most cases",
        "The brachial plexus is at risk from the supraclavicular approach - it's posterior/superior, relatively protected"
