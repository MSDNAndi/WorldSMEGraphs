    "statement": {
      "text": "Tibial artery exposure is essential for limb salvage bypass in patients with critical limb-threatening ischemia (CLTI). The three tibial vessels - anterior tibial (AT), posterior tibial (PT), and peroneal arteries - each require specific surgical approaches. Selection of target vessel depends on angiographic patency, quality, and runoff to the foot. Tibial exposure represents advanced vascular surgical technique requiring precise anatomic knowledge.",
      "formal": "Tibial Exposure: AT (lateral calf, between tibia and fibula, through interosseous membrane) | PT (medial calf, behind soleus, at ankle behind malleolus) | Peroneal (lateral calf, fibula resection or medial approach) | Critical: Small vessels (2-3mm), paired venae comitantes, associated nerves"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "The tibial vessels are like three smaller roads branching off from the popliteal artery highway, each running to different parts of the foot and ankle. The anterior tibial runs down the front of the leg (becoming the dorsalis pedis at the ankle), the posterior tibial runs behind the inner ankle bone (you can feel this pulse at your ankle), and the peroneal runs between the two bones of the calf (hardest to access).",
      "key_insight": "For limb salvage, you only need ONE good tibial vessel with continuous flow to the foot. The choice of which vessel to target depends on which one is open all the way down - a patent posterior tibial at the ankle is useless if there's a long occlusion proximally. Preoperative imaging (angiography or CTA) is essential for planning which vessel to expose.",
      "technical_details": "Anterior Tibial: (1) Lateral leg incision between tibia and fibula; (2) Incise crural fascia; (3) Separate anterior tibial muscle from extensor digitorum longus; (4) Artery lies on interosseous membrane with deep peroneal nerve; (5) Paired venae comitantes flank artery. Posterior Tibial: (1) Medial leg incision posterior to tibia; (2) Divide soleus from tibia; (3) Artery lies with tibial nerve and venae comitantes; (4) At ankle, artery is behind medial malleolus. Peroneal: (1) Lateral approach with fibula resection for direct exposure; (2) Or medial approach through below-knee popliteal dissection, tracing tibioperoneal trunk; (3) Artery lies deep, close to fibula; (4) Most challenging tibial exposure.",
      "common_misconceptions": [
        "All tibial vessels are equally easy to access - the peroneal is significantly more challenging",
        "Tibial bypass has poor outcomes - with good technique and appropriate selection, 5-year patency is 60-70%",
        "If one tibial is occluded, limb is unsalvageable - only one patent vessel is needed",
        "Tibial arteries are too small for bypass - 2-3mm vessels can be anastomosed with proper technique"
