    "statement": {
      "text": "Carotid artery exposure is the foundation for carotid endarterectomy (CEA) and carotid repair. The procedure requires meticulous dissection to expose the common carotid artery (CCA), internal carotid artery (ICA), and external carotid artery (ECA) while protecting multiple cranial nerves. The vagus nerve runs in the carotid sheath; the hypoglossal nerve crosses anteriorly; the marginal mandibular nerve is at risk with high exposure; and the glossopharyngeal nerve lies deep at the ICA origin.",
      "formal": "Carotid Exposure: Incision along sternocleidomastoid (SCM) → Divide platysma → Retract SCM laterally → Open carotid sheath → Expose CCA/ICA/ECA → Control vessels | Critical nerves: Vagus (in sheath), Hypoglossal (crosses anteriorly), Marginal mandibular (high), Glossopharyngeal (deep at bifurcation)"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Carotid exposure is like accessing the main highway to the brain through the side of the neck. The carotid artery sits in a protective sheath along with the jugular vein and vagus nerve. The surgeon must navigate around multiple 'power lines' (cranial nerves) that control tongue movement, facial expression, and voice to reach the artery safely.",
      "key_insight": "The secret to safe carotid surgery is understanding the layered anatomy and knowing where each nerve lives. The vagus runs in the carotid sheath (posterolateral), the hypoglossal crosses the field (can be seen and protected), and the marginal mandibular nerve is only at risk if you go too high. Injury to any of these causes significant morbidity - drooping lip, tongue deviation, or hoarseness.",
      "technical_details": "Technique: (1) Patient supine, head turned away, neck extended with shoulder roll; (2) Incision along anterior border of SCM from mastoid to sternal notch (or shorter for CEA); (3) Divide platysma; (4) Identify and divide facial vein; (5) Retract SCM laterally, jugular vein posteriorly; (6) Identify vagus nerve in posterior carotid sheath; (7) Open sheath anteriorly over CCA; (8) Trace CCA to bifurcation; (9) Identify and protect hypoglossal nerve crossing field (usually at level of bifurcation); (10) Expose ICA to disease-free segment; (11) Expose ECA and superior thyroid artery. For high ICA exposure: divide posterior belly of digastric, sublux mandible, divide styloid muscles.",
      "common_misconceptions": [
        "The vagus nerve is always visible - it can hide in posterior sheath, especially in reoperation",
        "Hypoglossal nerve injury is rare - it's the most commonly injured nerve in CEA (2-5%)",
        "You don't need to see the glossopharyngeal nerve - knowing it exists at the ICA origin prevents traction injury",
        "High carotid lesions can't be approached surgically - mandibular subluxation extends exposure significantly"
