  "content": {
    "definition": {
      "formal": "Cyanoacrylate venous closure is a non-thermal, non-tumescent endovenous ablation technique in which a medical-grade cyanoacrylate adhesive is delivered into an incompetent saphenous vein via catheter under ultrasound guidance, causing immediate mechanical closure followed by inflammatory obliteration.",
      "clinical": "A method to seal varicose veins using a specialized 'superglue' that is injected inside the vein, causing immediate closure without the need for numbing injections along the entire vein."
    },
    "core_concepts": [
      {
        "concept": "Mechanism of Action",
        "explanation": "N-butyl cyanoacrylate polymerizes on contact with blood or tissue, creating immediate mechanical closure. This triggers a foreign body inflammatory response leading to chronic fibrosis and permanent vein obliteration over weeks to months.",
        "clinical_significance": "Unlike thermal ablation, closure is immediate and not dependent on heat generation. This eliminates the need for tumescent anesthesia."
      },
      {
        "concept": "Non-Thermal Non-Tumescent (NTNT) Advantage",
        "explanation": "No tumescent anesthesia is required because there is no heat. This reduces procedure time, eliminates multiple needle sticks, and allows treatment of the entire vein with a single needle puncture.",
        "clinical_significance": "Improved patient comfort, shorter procedure times, and no risk of thermal nerve injury."
      },
      {
        "concept": "Delivery System",
        "explanation": "The adhesive is delivered through a specialized catheter system in 0.1 mL aliquots every 3 cm along the vein. External compression is applied for 3 minutes after each injection to ensure wall apposition.",
        "clinical_significance": "Precise delivery technique ensures adequate adhesive distribution without excess material."
      },
      {
        "concept": "Patient Selection",
        "explanation": "Ideal candidates have straight GSV segments with diameter 5-15 mm. May be less suitable for very tortuous veins where catheter advancement is difficult. No restriction for patients with cardiac shunts (no air or foam used).",
        "clinical_significance": "Unlike foam sclerotherapy, CAC is safe in patients with PFO. Unlike thermal ablation, no concern for nerve injury in lower leg."
      },
      {
        "concept": "Inflammatory Response",
        "explanation": "Patients commonly experience mild phlebitis with tenderness and erythema along the treated vein at 1-2 weeks. This represents the expected inflammatory response to the cyanoacrylate and resolves with time.",
        "clinical_significance": "Counsel patients that local tenderness and redness are expected and not concerning."
