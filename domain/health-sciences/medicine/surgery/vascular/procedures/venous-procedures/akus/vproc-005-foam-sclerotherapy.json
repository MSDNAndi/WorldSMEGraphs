  "content": {
    "definition": {
      "formal": "Foam sclerotherapy is a minimally invasive treatment for varicose veins in which a sclerosing agent mixed with air or CO2 to create foam is injected directly into the target vein under ultrasound guidance, causing endothelial damage, thrombosis, and eventual fibrosis and obliteration of the vein.",
      "clinical": "A technique to close varicose veins by injecting a detergent-like medication mixed into foam, which displaces blood and damages the vein lining, causing the vein to scar shut."
    },
    "core_concepts": [
      {
        "concept": "Foam Preparation",
        "explanation": "Foam is created by mixing sclerosant (polidocanol or sodium tetradecyl sulfate) with room air or CO2 using syringes connected by a three-way stopcock. The Tessari method involves rapidly pushing fluid between syringes 10-20 times to create microfoam.",
        "clinical_significance": "Foam displaces blood from the vein, allowing direct contact of sclerosant with endothelium. Foam is more potent than liquid for the same concentration."
      },
      {
        "concept": "Mechanism of Action",
        "explanation": "Sclerosant detergent causes endothelial cell membrane disruption leading to cell death. This triggers thrombosis within the vein. Over weeks to months, the thrombus organizes and the vein becomes a fibrous cord.",
        "clinical_significance": "The goal is complete fibrosis (sclerosis) of the vein. Incomplete treatment results in recanalization and recurrence."
      },
      {
        "concept": "Ultrasound Guidance",
        "explanation": "Real-time ultrasound allows precise needle placement and monitoring of foam distribution. Foam appears as bright (hyperechoic) bubbles displacing blood. Foam spread can be tracked through tributaries and into deep veins.",
        "clinical_significance": "Ultrasound prevents inadvertent arterial injection and allows monitoring for deep vein passage of foam."
      },
      {
        "concept": "Volume and Concentration Limits",
        "explanation": "European guidelines recommend maximum 10 mL foam per session, using concentrations of 1-3% for larger veins and 0.5-1% for smaller veins. Exceeding limits increases risk of neurological side effects.",
        "clinical_significance": "Volume limitation is a safety measure. Large veins may require staged treatments."
      },
      {
        "concept": "Post-procedure Management",
        "explanation": "Compression stockings are applied immediately and worn for 1-2 weeks. Patients are encouraged to walk immediately. The vein may feel hard and cord-like (thrombophlebitis) which resolves over weeks.",
        "clinical_significance": "Compression improves outcomes by maintaining vein wall apposition. Patients should be counseled about expected post-procedure symptoms."
