    "statement": {
      "text": "Endovascular Aortic Repair (EVAR) is a minimally invasive technique for treating abdominal aortic aneurysms by deploying a stent-graft through femoral artery access. It excludes the aneurysm from systemic pressure while maintaining blood flow through the graft lumen. EVAR offers lower perioperative mortality than open repair but requires lifelong surveillance for endoleaks and device complications.",
      "formal": "EVAR: Percutaneous/cutdown femoral access → Guidewire/catheter advancement → Stent-graft deployment → Aneurysm sac exclusion | Advantages: Reduced early mortality, shorter ICU/hospital stay | Trade-offs: Requires surveillance, risk of endoleak, reintervention"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Instead of opening the abdomen and sewing in a new piece of artery, EVAR works like putting a sleeve inside the weakened aorta. Through small cuts in the groin, doctors thread a compressed stent-graft up to the aneurysm, then expand it like a self-opening umbrella. Blood now flows through the new graft, taking pressure off the weakened aneurysm wall. It's like putting a protective pipe inside a leaky pipe.",
      "key_insight": "EVAR trades early mortality benefit for late complications. The DREAM and EVAR-1 trials showed EVAR has ~1-2% early mortality vs 3-5% for open repair, but by 5-10 years, survival curves converge as EVAR patients experience more reinterventions and late ruptures. Patient selection is key: EVAR may be ideal for high-risk patients who need immediate survival benefit, while open repair may be better for young, fit patients who can tolerate a more durable procedure.",
      "technical_details": "Standard EVAR requires suitable anatomy: adequate proximal landing zone (infrarenal neck ≥10-15mm length, ≤32mm diameter, ≤60° angulation), access vessels ≥7mm for most devices, adequate distal landing in iliacs. The procedure involves: (1) bilateral femoral access (cutdown or percutaneous), (2) placement of stiff guidewire across aneurysm, (3) main body deployment from infrarenal neck to one iliac, (4) contralateral limb connection, (5) balloon molding of seal zones, (6) completion angiography. Current devices include modular bifurcated grafts (Cook, Gore, Medtronic, Endologix). Complex anatomy may require fenestrated or branched EVAR.",
      "common_misconceptions": [
        "EVAR is easier than open surgery - technically demanding with significant learning curve",
        "EVAR is always better than open repair - open repair has better long-term durability",
        "Once EVAR is done, treatment is complete - requires lifelong surveillance",
        "All AAAs can be treated with EVAR - anatomy must be suitable, ~50% of AAAs qualify"
