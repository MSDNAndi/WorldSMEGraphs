    "statement": {
      "text": "Lower extremity bypass is a surgical procedure to restore blood flow by connecting an inflow artery to an outflow artery using a conduit (autologous vein or prosthetic graft), bypassing the diseased segment. The great saphenous vein is the preferred conduit for infrainguinal bypass, providing superior patency (70-80% at 5 years) compared to prosthetic grafts (50-60% above-knee, 30-40% below-knee).",
      "formal": "Lower Extremity Bypass: Inflow artery (femoral) → Conduit (GSV preferred) → Outflow artery (popliteal/tibial) | Conduit Hierarchy: GSV > Arm vein > PTFE/Dacron | 5-year Patency: Vein 70-80%, Prosthetic AK 50-60%, Prosthetic BK 30-40%"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Lower extremity bypass is like building a highway bypass around a traffic jam. Instead of trying to fix the blocked artery, you create a new route for blood to flow around the blockage. The 'highway' can be built from the patient's own vein (preferred) or a synthetic tube. The vein works better because the body recognizes it as 'self' and it adapts to arterial pressure - synthetic grafts are more prone to clotting, especially in smaller arteries.",
      "key_insight": "The conduit matters more than the operation itself. A bypass with a good-quality great saphenous vein can last decades. A prosthetic bypass, especially below the knee, may fail within a few years. That's why vein mapping (ultrasound to assess vein quality) before surgery is essential - if the GSV isn't available, arm veins are the next choice before resorting to prosthetic.",
      "technical_details": "Target vessel selection: Choose the most proximal adequate inflow (often common femoral artery) and the best outflow target based on angiography (continuous runoff to foot is ideal). Vein harvest: GSV from ipsilateral or contralateral leg, can be used reversed (valves oriented against flow) or in-situ (valves lysed with valvulotome). Configurations: Fem-pop above-knee, Fem-pop below-knee, Fem-tibial, Sequential (multiple anastomoses). Graft surveillance is critical - detect stenosis before thrombosis allows revision to maintain patency.",
      "common_misconceptions": [
        "Prosthetic is equivalent to vein - vein patency is significantly better",
        "Failed bypass = amputation - redo bypass or intervention may salvage limb",
        "All PAD patients need bypass - many can be treated with endovascular techniques",
        "Bypass cures the disease - underlying atherosclerosis continues, surveillance needed"
