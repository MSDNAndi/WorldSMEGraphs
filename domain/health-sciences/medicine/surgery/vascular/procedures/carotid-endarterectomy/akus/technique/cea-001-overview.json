    "statement": {
      "text": "Carotid Endarterectomy (CEA) is a surgical procedure to remove atherosclerotic plaque from the carotid artery, reducing stroke risk in patients with significant carotid stenosis. It is the gold standard treatment for symptomatic stenosis ≥50% and asymptomatic stenosis ≥60-70%, with landmark trials (NASCET, ECST, ACAS) demonstrating stroke reduction.",
      "formal": "CEA: Surgical exposure of carotid bifurcation → Arteriotomy → Plaque endarterectomy → Arteriotomy closure (primary or patch) | Indication: Symptomatic ≥50% | Asymptomatic ≥60-70% | Target: Combined stroke/death <3% (asymptomatic) or <6% (symptomatic)"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "CEA is essentially 'cleaning out' a clogged artery. The surgeon makes an incision in the neck, exposes the carotid artery, temporarily stops blood flow, opens the artery, and physically removes the cholesterol plaque like scraping wallpaper off a wall. Then the artery is closed, blood flow restored, and the now-clean artery is less likely to throw off clots to the brain.",
      "key_insight": "The benefit of CEA depends entirely on surgical expertise - it only helps if the combined stroke/death rate is below 3% (asymptomatic) or 6% (symptomatic). If the surgeon's complication rate is higher, the operation causes more strokes than it prevents. This is why outcomes are tracked and volume matters.",
      "technical_details": "Technique: (1) Neck incision along sternocleidomastoid; (2) Exposure of common, internal, and external carotid arteries; (3) Systemic heparinization; (4) Clamping proximal and distal to plaque; (5) Shunting if needed (based on EEG, stump pressure, or surgeon preference); (6) Arteriotomy from CCA into ICA; (7) Plaque dissection and removal; (8) Tacking sutures for distal endpoint; (9) Closure with patch (vein or prosthetic) or primary; (10) Clamp removal and flow restoration. Eversion CEA is an alternative: transecting the ICA, everting and removing plaque, then reanastomosing.",
      "common_misconceptions": [
        "CEA is major surgery - it's well-tolerated, often done under regional anesthesia",
        "All carotid stenosis needs CEA - asymptomatic disease benefit is marginal with modern medical therapy",
        "CEA eliminates stroke risk - it reduces but doesn't eliminate risk, especially contralateral/lacunar strokes",
        "Carotid stenting has replaced CEA - CEA remains the standard; stenting for selected patients"
