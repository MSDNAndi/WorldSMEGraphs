    "statement": {
      "text": "Carotid endarterectomy (CEA) is surgical removal of atherosclerotic plaque from the carotid bifurcation to prevent stroke. It is the gold standard for symptomatic carotid stenosis ≥50% and asymptomatic stenosis ≥60-70% in appropriate patients. The procedure involves arteriotomy, plaque removal, and patch closure, with neurological monitoring.",
      "formal": "CEA: Surgical plaque removal from carotid bifurcation; Indications: symptomatic ≥50% (periop risk <6%), asymptomatic ≥60-70% (periop risk <3%); Technique: arteriotomy, endarterectomy, patch closure"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "CEA is like opening a clogged pipe and scraping out the deposits. We make an incision in the carotid artery, carefully remove the plaque that's blocking and breaking off into the brain, and then repair the artery, usually with a patch to make it wider than before. It's like cleaning out a drain and leaving it larger to prevent future clogs.",
      "key_insight": "CEA has been proven to prevent stroke in landmark trials (NASCET, ACAS), but benefit depends on low perioperative risk. If the surgery causes too many strokes itself, the benefit is negated. Quality metrics demand <6% perioperative stroke/death for symptomatic and <3% for asymptomatic patients.",
      "technical_details": "Standard CEA: longitudinal arteriotomy from CCA across bifurcation into ICA, develop endarterectomy plane in media, remove plaque in one piece, tack distal intima if needed, patch closure (bovine pericardium, Dacron, or vein). Eversion CEA: transect ICA, evert and remove plaque, reimplant - no patch needed. Shunting (Javid, Pruitt) used if cerebral perfusion inadequate during cross-clamp."
