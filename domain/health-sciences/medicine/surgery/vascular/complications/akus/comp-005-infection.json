      "text": "Vascular graft infection is a devastating complication classified by depth (Szilagyi I-III), with treatment depending on graft location, extent of infection, and organism, ranging from antibiotics and debridement to complete graft excision with extra-anatomic reconstruction.",

    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "An infected graft is like having a contaminated highway in your body - it can cause bleeding, sepsis, and death if not managed. Treatment depends on how deep the infection goes and where the graft is located.",
      "key_insight": "Aortic graft infection has 50% mortality with conservative treatment. Complete graft excision with extra-anatomic bypass is gold standard but carries high morbidity. Selected cases may allow in situ replacement with antibiotic-impregnated graft or cryopreserved homograft.",
      "technical_details": "Szilagyi classification: Grade I (dermis), Grade II (subcutaneous), Grade III (graft involvement). Organisms: early (<4 months) Staph aureus, late (>4 months) Staph epidermidis, rarely gram-negative. Diagnosis: CT with perigraft air/fluid, WBC scan, aspiration culture. Treatment options: (1) Antibiotics + local debridement (Grade I-II), (2) Graft preservation with muscle flap (limited Grade III), (3) Complete excision with extra-anatomic reconstruction (gold standard for aortic), (4) In situ replacement with rifampin-soaked or cryopreserved graft (selected cases)."
