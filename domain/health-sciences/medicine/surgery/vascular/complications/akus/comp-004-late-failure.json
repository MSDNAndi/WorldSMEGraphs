    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Years after a bypass, the same disease that caused the original blockage can affect the new connections or even the bypass graft itself. It's like fixing one pothole while more develop on the same road over time.",
      "key_insight": "Late graft failure reflects the systemic nature of atherosclerosis. Risk factor modification (smoking cessation, statin therapy, glycemic control) is essential. Vein grafts can develop their own atherosclerosis, appearing as irregular lesions on surveillance.",
      "technical_details": "Causes: (1) Inflow disease progression, (2) Outflow disease progression, (3) Vein graft atherosclerosis, (4) Aneurysmal degeneration. Timing: typically >2 years post-surgery. Appearance: irregular, ulcerated lesions (vs smooth hyperplastic lesions of intermediate failure). Prevention: aggressive risk factor modification - smoking cessation (most important), statin therapy, antiplatelet agents, BP and glucose control. Management: endovascular intervention for focal lesions, new bypass if extensive disease."
