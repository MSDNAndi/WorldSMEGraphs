    "statement": {
      "text": "Intermediate graft failure (1 month to 2 years post-procedure) is primarily caused by neointimal hyperplasia developing at anastomoses, within the conduit, or at valve sites, requiring surveillance and intervention to prevent thrombosis.",
      "formal": "Intermediate_Failure: Neointimal_Hyperplasia → Anastomotic/Conduit_Stenosis → Graft_Thrombosis"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Intermediate graft failure is like a road gradually narrowing because the pavement keeps getting thicker. The body's healing response creates too much tissue at the connection points and inside the graft, slowly choking off blood flow.",
      "key_insight": "Neointimal hyperplasia is a proliferative response to surgical injury. It's most common at the distal anastomosis where compliance mismatch creates wall stress. Surveillance duplex at 6 weeks, 3 months, then every 6-12 months detects stenosis before thrombosis.",
      "technical_details": "Pathology: smooth muscle cell proliferation, extracellular matrix deposition at anastomoses, valve sites, clamp sites. Peak incidence: 3-18 months post-surgery. Risk factors: female sex, small conduit, poor runoff, compliance mismatch. Detection: duplex velocities - PSV ratio >2.5 or PSV >300cm/s indicates >50% stenosis. Treatment: balloon angioplasty, patch angioplasty, interposition graft, or new bypass depending on extent."
