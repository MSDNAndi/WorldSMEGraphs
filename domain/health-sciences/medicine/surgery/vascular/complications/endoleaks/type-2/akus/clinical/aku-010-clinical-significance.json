      "formal": "Clinical Impact: High incidence + Low rupture risk + Surveillance burden + Prognostic uncertainty = Common management dilemma"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Type 2 endoleaks are like a nagging worry after EVAR - they're very common, usually not dangerous, but you can't completely ignore them. They require ongoing monitoring, which has costs and patient burden, but the alternative of over-treating would lead to unnecessary interventions.",
      "key_insight": "The clinical significance paradox: Type 2 endoleaks are simultaneously the most common endoleak type AND have the lowest per-case rupture risk, yet their high prevalence means they account for substantial surveillance resources and clinical attention.",
      "technical_details": "Type 2 endoleaks challenge the binary success/failure paradigm of EVAR. Unlike Type 1 or 3 (clear failures requiring intervention), Type 2 exists in a gray zone where technical success (stent-graft properly deployed) coexists with anatomic imperfection (persistent sac perfusion)."
