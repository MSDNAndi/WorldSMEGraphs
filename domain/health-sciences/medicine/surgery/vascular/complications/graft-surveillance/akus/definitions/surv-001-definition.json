    "title": "Infrainguinal Vein Graft Surveillance",

        "term": "Rationale",
        "description": "Myointimal hyperplasia causes most vein graft failures at 1-24 months; stenoses progress to occlusion if untreated; failing grafts (stenotic) can be revised; occluded grafts often cannot be salvaged"

        "term": "Surveillance Protocol",
        "description": "Duplex ultrasound: post-op before discharge (baseline), 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months, then every 6-12 months. More intensive in first 2 years (highest failure risk)"

        "term": "Duplex Velocity Criteria",
        "description": "Peak systolic velocity (PSV) ratio >2:1 suggests 50% stenosis; PSV ratio >3.5:1 or PSV <45 cm/s suggests 70%+ stenosis or impending failure; low flow (<45 cm/s) predicts occlusion"

        "term": "Failing vs Failed Graft",
        "description": "Failing graft: stenotic but patent; 80-90% can be saved with intervention. Failed graft: occluded; only 20-30% can be salvaged with thrombolysis/thrombectomy"

        "term": "Intervention Threshold",
