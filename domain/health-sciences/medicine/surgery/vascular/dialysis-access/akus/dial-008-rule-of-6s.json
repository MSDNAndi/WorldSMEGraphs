    "statement": {
      "text": "The Rule of 6s defines clinical criteria for AV fistula maturation: blood flow >600 mL/min, vein diameter >6 mm, and depth <6 mm from skin surface, typically assessed at 4-6 weeks post-creation.",
      "formal": "Mature_AVF = Flow>600mL/min + Diameter>6mm + Depth<6mm"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "The Rule of 6s provides simple, memorable criteria for determining if a fistula is ready for dialysis needle cannulation. A fistula needs enough flow to provide adequate dialysis, large enough diameter for safe cannulation, and shallow enough to be easily accessed.",
      "key_insight": "Primary fistula failure (failure to mature) occurs in 20-60% of cases, making early assessment and intervention critical. Ultrasound assessment at 4-6 weeks allows early identification of failing fistulas for salvage procedures (angioplasty, revision).",
      "technical_details": "Physical exam findings of mature fistula: palpable thrill (high-pitched vibration), soft and easily compressible body, visible outflow vein enlargement. Ultrasound criteria: measure flow at brachial artery (for upper arm) or radial artery (for forearm), measure diameter in transverse at anastomosis and outflow, measure depth from skin surface. Immature fistula: flow <500 mL/min at 4-6 weeks is concerning. Intervention options: angioplasty of stenosis, revision of anastomosis, accessory vein ligation, superficialization for depth issues."
