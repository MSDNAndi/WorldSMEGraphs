    "definition": "A synthetic conduit used as an arterial or venous substitute when autologous vein is unavailable, unsuitable, or in anatomic locations where synthetic material is preferred. Major types include expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE/Gore-Tex) and woven/knitted polyester (Dacron). Selection depends on location, size match, infection risk, and required porosity.",

      "characteristics": [
