    "key_points": [
      "Digital eye strain affects 50-90% of computer users",
      "Symptoms: eye fatigue, dryness, blurred vision, headache, neck/shoulder pain",
      "Blink rate drops from 15/min to 5/min when viewing screens - causing dry eyes",
      "20-20-20 rule: Every 20 minutes, look at something 20 feet away for 20 seconds",
      "Screen position should be 20-26 inches away, slightly below eye level",
      "Room lighting should match screen brightness (not brighter than screen)",
      "Accommodative fatigue from sustained near focus is a key mechanism"
    ],
    "statement": {
      "text": "Digital eye strain (computer vision syndrome) is a complex of ocular and visual symptoms resulting from prolonged near-focus work on digital screens. Key mechanisms include accommodative fatigue from sustained near focus, reduced blink rate leading to tear film instability, and ergonomic factors. The 20-20-20 rule provides evidence-based symptom prevention.",
      "formal": "Eye Strain = f(Screen Time × Near Focus × Reduced Blink Rate × Poor Lighting) - Preventive Interventions"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Your eyes aren't designed for hours of staring at glowing rectangles 2 feet away. When focusing on screens, your eye muscles stay contracted (like holding a weight), you blink less (drying your eyes), and you receive unnatural light patterns. The 20-20-20 rule is like putting down the weight briefly - relaxing the focus muscles by looking far away.",
      "key_insight": "The reduced blink rate is a major culprit often overlooked. We normally blink 15-20 times per minute, spreading tears evenly. During concentrated screen work, this drops to 3-5 times per minute, causing the tear film to break up and symptoms of dryness, grittiness, and fatigue."
