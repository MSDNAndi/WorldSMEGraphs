    "title": "Colonoscopy Procedure",
    "summary": "Colonoscopy is the gold standard for colorectal cancer screening and diagnosis of colonic pathology. It involves endoscopic visualization of the entire colon after adequate bowel preparation. Quality indicators include cecal intubation rate, adenoma detection rate (ADR), and withdrawal time. Polypectomy during colonoscopy is both diagnostic and therapeutic.",
    "key_points": [
      "Gold standard for colorectal cancer (CRC) screening; recommended starting age 45",
      "Adequate bowel prep is essential for quality colonoscopy",
      "Adenoma detection rate (ADR) is the key quality indicator: ≥25% overall (≥30% men, ≥20% women)",
      "Withdrawal time ≥6 minutes improves adenoma detection",

    "statement": "Colonoscopy is the gold standard for colorectal cancer screening and polyp removal, with quality measured by adenoma detection rate, cecal intubation rate, and adherence to surveillance guidelines.",
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Colonoscopy is like exploring a tunnel with a camera, looking for bumps (polyps) that could become cancer. The key is preparation (the tunnel needs to be clean to see everything) and thoroughness (taking time to look carefully). Finding and removing polyps during the procedure prevents cancer from developing.",
      "key_insight": "The adenoma detection rate (ADR) is the most important quality metric because it directly correlates with cancer prevention. Each 1% increase in ADR correlates with 3% decrease in interval CRC. Endoscopists with higher ADR catch more cancer precursors.",
      "technical_details": "Split-dose bowel prep (half the evening before, half morning of) yields superior cleanliness. Cecal intubation should be documented with photos of landmarks (appendiceal orifice, ileocecal valve, terminal ileum). Withdrawal time of ≥6 minutes (not including biopsy/polypectomy time) is associated with higher ADR."
