    "statement": "Hepatic encephalopathy is a reversible neuropsychiatric syndrome caused by accumulation of neurotoxins (primarily ammonia) in patients with liver dysfunction or portosystemic shunting, ranging from subtle cognitive deficits to coma.",
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "The liver normally detoxifies ammonia (produced by gut bacteria and protein metabolism) into urea for kidney excretion. When the liver is damaged or blood bypasses it through portosystemic shunts, ammonia reaches the brain and causes astrocyte swelling, neurotransmitter changes, and brain dysfunction.",
      "key_insight": "The key to managing HE is identifying and treating the precipitant (infection, bleeding, dehydration, constipation, medications) while reducing ammonia production/absorption. Lactulose works by acidifying the colon (converts NH3 to NH4+ which cannot be absorbed) and promotes catharsis. Rifaximin reduces ammonia-producing bacteria.",
      "technical_details": "Ammonia crosses blood-brain barrier and is metabolized by astrocytes using glutamine synthetase (NH3 + glutamate → glutamine). Glutamine accumulation causes astrocyte swelling and oxidative stress. Ammonia also affects GABA-benzodiazepine receptor complex, contributing to altered consciousness. Other factors include inflammation, manganese accumulation, and false neurotransmitters from aromatic amino acids."
