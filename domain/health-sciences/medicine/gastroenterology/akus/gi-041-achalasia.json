    "statement": {"text": "Achalasia is a primary esophageal motility disorder characterized by failure of the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) to relax and loss of esophageal peristalsis. It results from degeneration of inhibitory neurons in the myenteric plexus. Patients present with progressive dysphagia to both solids and liquids. High-resolution manometry is diagnostic. Treatment aims to disrupt the LES through pneumatic dilation, Heller myotomy, or POEM.", "formal": "Achalasia = Elevated IRP (>15 mmHg) + Absent peristalsis (100% failed) on HRM"},
    "explanation": {"intuition": "The esophagus pushes food toward the stomach through peristalsis. At the bottom, the LES must open to let food through. In achalasia, the nerves that tell the LES to relax are destroyed, so the gate stays closed. Food backs up, stretching the esophagus while the narrow LES creates a bottleneck.", "key_insight": "Dysphagia to both solids AND liquids from the beginning distinguishes achalasia (motility) from mechanical obstruction (stricture, cancer) which starts with solids. Treatment doesn't cure but palliates by breaking the dysfunctional LES.", "technical_details": "HRM defines 3 subtypes: Type I (classic), Type II (panesophageal pressurization, best response), Type III (spastic, worst prognosis). Chicago Classification v4.0 criteria: IRP >15 mmHg AND 100% failed peristalsis."},
