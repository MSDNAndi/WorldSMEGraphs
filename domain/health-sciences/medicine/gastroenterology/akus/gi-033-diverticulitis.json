    "title": "Diverticulitis",
    "summary": "Inflammation and/or infection of colonic diverticula, typically in the sigmoid colon, presenting with left lower quadrant pain, fever, and leukocytosis, ranging from uncomplicated to complicated disease with abscess, perforation, or fistula",
    "key_points": ["Inflammation of colonic diverticula - sigmoid most common", "LLQ pain + fever + leukocytosis = classic presentation", "CT abdomen/pelvis is diagnostic test of choice", "Uncomplicated: outpatient antibiotics or observation", "Complicated: abscess, perforation, fistula, obstruction", "Hinchey classification stages severity of perforation", "Colonoscopy 6-8 weeks after resolution to exclude cancer"],
    "statement": {"text": "Diverticulitis is inflammation of colonic diverticula, most commonly in the sigmoid colon due to microperforation from fecalith obstruction. Patients present with LLQ pain, fever, and leukocytosis. CT confirms diagnosis and identifies complications. Uncomplicated diverticulitis may be managed with antibiotics or observation; complicated disease (abscess, perforation) requires drainage or surgery.", "formal": "Diverticulitis = Diverticula + Inflammation/Microperforation | Uncomplicated = Antibiotics ± NPO | Complicated = Drainage/Surgery"},
    "explanation": {"intuition": "Diverticula are outpouchings in the colon wall that form at weak points where blood vessels penetrate. When stool gets trapped in a diverticulum, it can cause inflammation and microperforation - like an appendicitis but of the colon wall. Most cases are 'uncomplicated' and respond to antibiotics, but some progress to abscess or frank perforation.", "key_insight": "The sigmoid colon is most affected because it has the highest intraluminal pressure. Uncomplicated diverticulitis can often be managed outpatient; complicated disease (abscess, perforation, fistula) requires intervention. Always colonoscopy after recovery to rule out underlying malignancy.", "technical_details": "Hinchey Classification: I = pericolic abscess, II = pelvic abscess, III = purulent peritonitis, IV = fecal peritonitis. Small abscesses (<3cm) may resolve with antibiotics alone; larger need drainage. Colovesical fistula presents with pneumaturia and recurrent UTIs."},

    "pathophysiology": {"mechanism": "Diverticula form at points of penetration of vasa recta through circular muscle layer.
