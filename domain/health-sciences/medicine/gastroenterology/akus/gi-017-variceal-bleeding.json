    "title": "Variceal Bleeding",
    "summary": "Variceal hemorrhage is a life-threatening complication of portal hypertension, most commonly from esophageal varices in patients with cirrhosis. Management includes resuscitation, vasoactive drugs (octreotide), prophylactic antibiotics, endoscopic band ligation, and TIPS for refractory bleeding. Primary and secondary prophylaxis with non-selective beta-blockers and endoscopic therapy reduce bleeding risk.",
    "key_points": [
      "Variceal bleeding occurs when HVPG ≥12 mmHg (clinically significant portal hypertension)",
      "Initial management: IV access, restrictive transfusion (Hgb target 7-8), vasoactive drugs, antibiotics",
      "Octreotide (or terlipressin) reduces splanchnic blood flow and portal pressure",
      "Endoscopic band ligation (EBL) is first-line endoscopic therapy for esophageal varices",
      "TIPS for refractory bleeding not controlled by 2 endoscopic attempts",
      "Primary prophylaxis: NSBB (propranolol, nadolol, carvedilol) or EBL for medium-large varices"
    ],
    "statement": "Variceal bleeding is managed with a multi-modal approach including resuscitation, pharmacotherapy (octreotide + antibiotics), endoscopic band ligation, and TIPS for refractory cases, with primary and secondary prophylaxis to prevent recurrence.",
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Cirrhosis causes scarring that blocks blood flow through the liver, forcing blood to find alternative routes (varices). These thin-walled vessels in the esophagus can burst under pressure, causing massive bleeding. Treatment aims to: (1) stop the bleeding (drugs + endoscopy), (2) prevent complications (antibiotics for SBP), and (3) reduce future bleeding risk (beta-blockers).",
      "key_insight": "The combination of vasoactive drugs (octreotide) AND prophylactic antibiotics is crucial - antibiotics reduce mortality independently of their infection-preventing role, possibly by reducing bacterial translocation that worsens portal hypertension. Always give antibiotics even without documented infection.",
      "technical_details": "HVPG (hepatic venous pressure gradient) ≥10 mmHg = clinically significant portal hypertension; ≥12 mmHg = risk of variceal bleeding. Non-selective beta-blockers reduce cardiac output AND cause splanchnic vasoconstriction, lowering portal pressure. Carvedilol may be more effective due to additional α-blocking anti-portal hypertensive effect."
