    "title": "Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD)",
    "summary": "Gastroesophageal reflux disease is a chronic condition caused by retrograde flow of gastric contents into the esophagus, leading to symptoms (heartburn, regurgitation) and/or complications (esophagitis, stricture, Barrett's). It is one of the most common GI conditions, affecting 20% of the US population, and is managed primarily with lifestyle modifications and acid suppression therapy.",
    "key_points": [
      "Classic symptoms: Heartburn and regurgitation (typical GERD)",
      "Atypical: Chronic cough, laryngitis, asthma, chest pain",
      "Erosive vs Non-erosive: Only 30-40% have visible esophagitis on endoscopy",
      "First-line treatment: Lifestyle modifications + PPI for 8 weeks",
      "Alarm symptoms: Dysphagia, weight loss, GI bleeding, anemia → endoscopy",
      "Refractory GERD: Consider pH testing, impedance monitoring, fundoplication"
    ],
    "statement": "GERD is defined by troublesome symptoms or complications caused by reflux of gastric contents, diagnosed clinically and managed with lifestyle modifications and acid suppression, with endoscopy reserved for alarm symptoms or refractory cases.",
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Think of the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) as a one-way valve that should only let food go down. In GERD, this valve is too relaxed (transient LES relaxations) or the pressure gradient favors reflux (hiatal hernia), allowing stomach acid to splash back up and burn the unprotected esophageal lining.",
      "key_insight": "Most GERD is diagnosed clinically based on typical symptoms responding to PPI trial - no testing needed. Endoscopy is NOT required for diagnosis but IS required for alarm symptoms, to evaluate complications, or for cancer surveillance in Barrett's.",
      "technical_details": "Transient LES relaxations (TLESRs) are the main mechanism in most GERD. Normal LES pressure is 10-35 mmHg. Hiatal hernia reduces LES competence. Acid pocket (unbuffered acid at gastric cardia) contributes to postprandial reflux. pH <4 in distal esophagus >4.2% of time is pathologic."
