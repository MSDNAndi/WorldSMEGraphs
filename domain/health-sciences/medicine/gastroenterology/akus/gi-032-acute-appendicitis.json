    "title": "Acute Appendicitis",
    "summary": "Acute appendicitis is the most common surgical emergency, caused by obstruction and subsequent inflammation of the vermiform appendix. Classic presentation includes periumbilical pain migrating to the right lower quadrant, accompanied by anorexia, nausea, and fever. Diagnosis relies on clinical assessment, inflammatory markers, and imaging (CT preferred in adults, ultrasound in children/pregnant).",
    "key_points": [
      "Most common cause of acute surgical abdomen; lifetime risk 7-8%",
      "Classic history: Periumbilical pain → RLQ (McBurney's point) over 12-24 hours",
      "Physical exam: RLQ tenderness, guarding, positive Rovsing's, psoas, obturator signs",
      "CT with IV contrast: 94% sensitivity, 95% specificity in adults",
      "Treatment: Appendectomy (laparoscopic preferred); antibiotics alone in select uncomplicated cases",
      "Perforation risk increases after 36-48 hours of symptom onset"
    ],
    "statement": "Acute appendicitis is diagnosed through classic history of migrating abdominal pain with RLQ tenderness, supported by imaging confirmation, and managed primarily with appendectomy to prevent perforation and complications.",
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Think of the appendix as a blind-ended tube that can get blocked like a clogged drain. Once blocked (by a fecalith or lymphoid hyperplasia), bacteria overgrow, the wall swells, blood supply is compromised, and eventually the appendix bursts. The pain starts vague and central (visceral) then localizes to RLQ (somatic) as the inflammation touches the parietal peritoneum.",
      "key_insight": "The MIGRATION of pain from periumbilical to RLQ is KEY to diagnosis. Initial visceral pain is referred to the periumbilical area (T10 dermatome). As inflammation extends to involve the parietal peritoneum overlying the appendix, pain localizes precisely to McBurney's point. Atypical presentations (retrocecal, pelvic appendix) may alter location.",
      "technical_details": "Luminal obstruction → mucus accumulation → bacterial overgrowth → mucosal ischemia → transmural inflammation → perforation. Alvarado score (MANTRELS: Migration, Anorexia, Nausea, Tenderness RLQ, Rebound, Elevated temp, Leukocytosis, Shift left) helps risk stratify. Score ≥7 suggests appendicitis."
