    "key_points": [
      "ERCP is primarily therapeutic, not diagnostic (MRCP for diagnosis)",

    "statement": {
      "text": "Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is a combined endoscopic and fluoroscopic procedure used primarily for therapeutic intervention on the biliary and pancreatic ducts. A side-viewing duodenoscope allows cannulation of the ampulla of Vater, contrast injection for imaging, and therapeutic maneuvers including sphincterotomy, stone extraction, and stent placement. Post-ERCP pancreatitis is the most common complication, mitigated by rectal indomethacin and prophylactic pancreatic duct stenting in high-risk patients.",
      "formal": "ERCP = Side-viewing duodenoscope + Ampulla cannulation + Fluoroscopy + Therapeutic intervention (sphincterotomy, stone extraction, stenting)"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Think of ERCP as keyhole surgery for the bile and pancreas ducts. A special scope goes down to the duodenum where the ducts empty. The operator cannulates the tiny opening (ampulla), injects dye to see the ducts on X-ray, then can cut the sphincter open, pull out stones, or place stents to relieve blockages—all without making surgical incisions.",
      "key_insight": "ERCP has largely transitioned from a diagnostic to a therapeutic procedure. MRCP and EUS now provide superior diagnostic imaging without the risks of ERCP. Reserve ERCP for patients who need intervention—not just to 'see what's going on.'",
      "technical_details": "Equipment: side-viewing duodenoscope (vs. forward-viewing EGD scope), sphincterotome, guidewires, extraction balloons/baskets, stents. Technique: identify ampulla → selective cannulation of bile or pancreatic duct → contrast injection → cholangiogram/pancreatogram → therapeutic intervention. Wire-guided cannulation reduces post-ERCP pancreatitis risk. Precut sphincterotomy for difficult access increases complications but enables access."

  "clinical_features": {
    "pathophysiology": {
      "mechanism": "ERCP provides access to the biliopancreatic ductal system through the natural orifice of the ampulla. Cannulation introduces catheters and guidewires into the desired duct. Sphincterotomy uses electrocautery to cut the sphincter muscle, widening the opening. This enables passage of extraction devices for stone removal or insertion of stents for strictures and obstruction. Post-ERCP pancreatitis results from papillary trauma, contrast injection into pancreatic duct, or thermal injury.",
