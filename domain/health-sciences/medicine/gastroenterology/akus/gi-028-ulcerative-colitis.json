    "title": "Ulcerative Colitis",
    "summary": "Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease characterized by continuous mucosal inflammation extending proximally from the rectum. Unlike Crohn's disease, UC is limited to the colon and is potentially curable with total colectomy. Management depends on disease extent and severity, ranging from topical aminosalicylates to biologics.",
    "key_points": [
      "Continuous inflammation starting from rectum extending proximally (no skip lesions)",
      "Mucosal/submucosal involvement only - NO transmural disease (unlike Crohn's)",
      "Classic triad: Bloody diarrhea, urgency, tenesmus",
      "Montreal classification: Proctitis (E1), Left-sided (E2), Extensive/Pancolitis (E3)",
      "5-ASA is first-line for mild-moderate disease; biologics for refractory/severe",
      "Colectomy is curative - removes colon cancer risk and disease"
    ],
    "statement": "Ulcerative colitis is a chronic relapsing-remitting inflammatory bowel disease causing continuous superficial colonic inflammation from the rectum, managed with aminosalicylates, immunomodulators, or biologics based on severity, with colectomy reserved for refractory or complicated cases.",
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Think of UC as a 'fire' that always starts at the rectum and spreads continuously upward along the colon like a lit fuse. The fire only burns the surface (mucosa) without going deeper - unlike Crohn's which burns through the entire wall. Because the fire is limited to the colon, removing the colon puts out the fire completely.",
      "key_insight": "The continuous nature and rectal involvement are KEY differentiators from Crohn's. If the rectum is spared or there are skip lesions, it's NOT UC - reconsider Crohn's or other diagnoses. This distinction matters because UC can be cured surgically while Crohn's cannot.",
      "technical_details": "UC involves a Th2-predominant immune response with abnormal barrier function. Crypt abscesses and pseudopolyps are characteristic histologic features. p-ANCA is positive in 60-70% (vs ASCA in Crohn's). Toxic megacolon (transverse colon >6cm) is a life-threatening complication requiring emergent colectomy."
