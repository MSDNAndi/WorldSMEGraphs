    "title": "Acute Cholecystitis",
    "summary": "Acute cholecystitis is inflammation of the gallbladder, most commonly from gallstone obstruction of the cystic duct (calculous cholecystitis). Clinical features include RUQ pain, fever, and positive Murphy sign. Ultrasound is the initial diagnostic study, with HIDA scan for equivocal cases. Treatment is cholecystectomy, ideally within 72 hours of presentation.",
    "key_points": [
      "90-95% of cases are calculous (gallstone-related); 5-10% acalculous",
      "Presentation: RUQ pain, fever, nausea, positive Murphy sign",
      "Ultrasound: gallstones, gallbladder wall thickening >3mm, pericholecystic fluid",
      "HIDA scan: non-visualization of gallbladder confirms cystic duct obstruction",
      "Early laparoscopic cholecystectomy (within 72 hours) preferred",
      "Acalculous cholecystitis: critically ill patients; high morbidity and mortality"
    ],
    "statement": "Acute cholecystitis presents with RUQ pain, fever, and Murphy sign, diagnosed by ultrasound showing gallstones and wall thickening, and treated definitively with early laparoscopic cholecystectomy.",
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "A gallstone blocks the gallbladder outlet (cystic duct), causing bile to back up. The trapped bile irritates and inflames the gallbladder wall. Think of it like a blocked drain causing water to back up and damage the pipes. The sooner you remove the gallbladder (fix the clog permanently), the better the outcome.",
      "key_insight": "Timing matters: early cholecystectomy (<72 hours) has lower complication rates, shorter hospital stays, and similar mortality compared to delayed surgery. The old teaching of 'cool down then operate later' has been replaced by 'operate early' in most cases.",
      "technical_details": "Murphy sign: inspiratory arrest during deep palpation of the RUQ due to pain when the inflamed gallbladder descends to meet the examining hand. Sonographic Murphy sign (pain with transducer pressure over gallbladder) is more reliable than clinical Murphy sign."
