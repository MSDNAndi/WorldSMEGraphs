    "statement": {"text": "Celiac disease is an immune-mediated enteropathy triggered by gluten in genetically susceptible individuals (HLA-DQ2/DQ8). Gluten peptides trigger T-cell mediated inflammation causing villous atrophy and malabsorption. Diagnosis requires serology (tTG-IgA) and small bowel biopsy while on gluten-containing diet. Treatment is strict lifelong gluten-free diet.", "formal": "Celiac = Gluten exposure + Genetic susceptibility (HLA-DQ2/8) + Villous atrophy + Positive serology"},
    "explanation": {"intuition": "Gluten proteins from wheat, barley, and rye cross the intestinal barrier and are modified by tissue transglutaminase (tTG). In people with specific HLA types, the immune system recognizes these modified proteins as foreign, triggering inflammation that destroys the tiny finger-like projections (villi) that absorb nutrients. No villi = malabsorption of everything.", "key_insight": "Must test ON a gluten-containing diet - gluten-free diet before testing causes false negatives. IgA deficiency is more common in celiac and causes false-negative IgA-based tests - check total IgA or use IgG-based tests. Villous atrophy is not specific to celiac - consider other causes if no response to GFD.", "technical_details": "Marsh classification grades histology: Type 0 normal, Type 1 increased IELs, Type 2 + crypt hyperplasia, Type 3a partial villous atrophy, 3b subtotal, 3c total. Response to GFD confirms diagnosis. Non-responsive celiac requires reassessment of diagnosis, dietary compliance, and exclusion of refractory sprue."},
