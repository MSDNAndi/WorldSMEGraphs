    "statement": {
      "text": "Wilson disease is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in ATP7B, encoding a copper-transporting ATPase. Defective copper excretion into bile leads to accumulation in liver (hepatitis, cirrhosis), brain (movement disorders, psychiatric symptoms), and cornea (Kayser-Fleischer rings). Diagnosis requires low ceruloplasmin, elevated urine copper, and liver biopsy confirmation. Lifelong chelation therapy or zinc prevents progression; liver transplant is curative.",
      "formal": "Wilson Disease = ATP7B mutation + Low ceruloplasmin + High urine copper + Liver copper >250 mcg/g + KF rings"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Copper is normally excreted in bile. When the copper pump (ATP7B) is broken, copper accumulates like a clogged drain. First it fills the liver, causing hepatitis and cirrhosis. Then it spills into the bloodstream, depositing in the brain (causing tremor, dystonia) and cornea (causing the golden-brown KF rings). Chelation therapy acts like a sponge to pull out the copper.",
      "key_insight": "Always consider Wilson in young patients (<40) with unexplained liver disease, neuropsychiatric symptoms, or hemolytic anemia. Kayser-Fleischer rings are pathognomonic but absent in 50% of hepatic presentations. The Leipzig scoring system integrates clinical and lab findings for diagnosis.",
      "technical_details": "ATP7B is a P-type ATPase in hepatocyte trans-Golgi network that loads copper onto ceruloplasmin and excretes copper into bile. Mutations cause both decreased ceruloplasmin (lack of copper loading) and bile copper accumulation. Copper is cytotoxic via reactive oxygen species generation. Penicillamine chelates copper for renal excretion; zinc blocks intestinal copper absorption."
