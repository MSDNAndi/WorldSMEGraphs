    "title": "Hereditary Hemochromatosis",
    "summary": "Hereditary hemochromatosis is an autosomal recessive disorder of iron metabolism, most commonly caused by C282Y mutation in HFE gene, leading to excessive intestinal iron absorption and tissue iron deposition. Manifestations include liver disease, diabetes, cardiomyopathy, arthropathy, and skin hyperpigmentation. Treatment is phlebotomy to reduce iron stores.",
    "key_points": [
      "Most common genetic disorder in Caucasians; HFE C282Y homozygosity (85-90%)",
      "Hepcidin deficiency leads to unrestricted iron absorption and tissue deposition",
      "Classic triad: cirrhosis, diabetes mellitus, skin bronzing ('bronze diabetes')",
      "Screening: transferrin saturation >45% + elevated ferritin; confirm with genetic testing",
      "Treatment: therapeutic phlebotomy to maintain ferritin 50-100 ng/mL",
      "Liver disease and cardiomyopathy improve with treatment; arthropathy and diabetes may persist"
    ],
    "statement": "Early diagnosis and treatment of hereditary hemochromatosis through regular phlebotomy prevents end-organ damage. Family screening of first-degree relatives is essential as phenotypic expression is variable.",
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Normally, hepcidin limits iron absorption by degrading ferroportin in enterocytes. HFE mutations impair hepcidin production, removing this regulatory brake. Iron absorption becomes unregulated, and since humans have no mechanism to excrete excess iron, it accumulates in parenchymal cells of the liver, pancreas, heart, and other organs, causing oxidative damage.",
      "key_insight": "Iron accumulation occurs slowly over decades, so symptoms appear in middle age. Women present later due to iron losses from menstruation and pregnancy. Phlebotomy before organ damage develops provides normal life expectancy; after cirrhosis develops, risk of HCC persists even with iron depletion.",
      "technical_details": "Diagnosis: fasting transferrin saturation >45% (sensitive) + ferritin elevated (specific for iron loading) → HFE genetic testing. C282Y homozygosity is diagnostic. If genetic testing negative but iron overload present, consider non-HFE hemochromatosis or secondary causes. MRI can quantify liver iron. Biopsy rarely needed now."

  "clinical_features": {
    "pathophysiology": {
      "mechanism": "HFE protein normally signals hepatocytes to produce hepcidin in response to iron loading. Mutant HFE (C282Y) impairs this signaling, resulting in inappropriately low hepcidin. Without hepcidin, ferroportin remains active on enterocytes, allowing continuous iron absorption. Excess iron deposits in hepatocytes, pancreatic islets, cardiomyocytes, and other tissues, causing oxidative damage via Fenton reaction.",
      "key_pathways": [
        "HFE mutation → impaired hepcidin signaling → low hepcidin",
        "Low hepcidin → unrestricted ferroportin activity → excessive iron absorption",

        "Iron in pancreas → beta cell damage → diabetes",
