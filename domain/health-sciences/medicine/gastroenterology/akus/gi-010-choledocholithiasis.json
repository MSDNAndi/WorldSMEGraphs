    "title": "Choledocholithiasis",
    "summary": "Choledocholithiasis refers to stones in the common bile duct (CBD), which may be primary (formed in bile duct) or secondary (passed from gallbladder). It can cause biliary colic, obstructive jaundice, cholangitis, or pancreatitis. Management involves stone extraction via ERCP, followed by cholecystectomy to prevent recurrence.",
    "key_points": [
      "10-15% of gallstone patients have concurrent CBD stones",
      "Can be asymptomatic or cause biliary colic, jaundice, cholangitis, pancreatitis",
      "Diagnosis: Elevated bilirubin/ALP, dilated CBD (>6mm or >8mm post-cholecystectomy)",
      "Risk stratification guides workup: MRCP for intermediate risk, direct ERCP for high risk",
      "ERCP with sphincterotomy and stone extraction is gold standard treatment",
      "Cholecystectomy should follow ERCP to prevent recurrent stones"
    ],
    "statement": "Choledocholithiasis presents with biliary obstruction signs and is diagnosed using liver tests and imaging, requiring ERCP for stone extraction and cholecystectomy to prevent recurrence.",
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Think of the bile duct as a plumbing pipe from the liver to the intestine. Stones can block this pipe, causing upstream pressure (jaundice, dilated ducts) and potential infection (cholangitis). ERCP is like a plumber's scope that goes up from the intestine to grab and remove the stone.",
      "key_insight": "Not all CBD stones need ERCP - risk stratification is key. Low probability: proceed to cholecystectomy with intraoperative cholangiogram. Intermediate probability: MRCP or EUS first to confirm stones before ERCP. High probability: proceed directly to ERCP. This approach minimizes unnecessary ERCPs and their complications.",
      "technical_details": "CBD normally ≤6mm (or ≤10mm post-cholecystectomy). Stones cause elevated conjugated bilirubin, ALP, GGT. Transabdominal ultrasound detects dilated CBD but misses 50% of stones. MRCP sensitivity 85-92% for stones. EUS sensitivity 94-97%. ERCP sensitivity 90%+ with therapeutic capability."
