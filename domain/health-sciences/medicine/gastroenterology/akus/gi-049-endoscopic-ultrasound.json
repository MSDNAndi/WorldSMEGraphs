    "title": "Endoscopic Ultrasound (EUS)",
    "summary": "Endoscopic ultrasound combines endoscopy with high-frequency ultrasonography to obtain detailed images of the GI tract wall layers and adjacent structures. It is invaluable for staging GI malignancies, evaluating pancreaticobiliary disease, characterizing submucosal lesions, and performing fine-needle aspiration (FNA) of lesions inaccessible to other techniques.",
    "key_points": [
      "Combines endoscope with ultrasound transducer at tip (radial or linear array)",
      "Best modality for T-staging esophageal, gastric, rectal, and pancreatic cancers",
      "Superior to CT for detecting small pancreatic masses and chronic pancreatitis",
      "EUS-FNA: Tissue acquisition from pancreatic masses, lymph nodes, liver lesions",
      "Therapeutic applications: celiac plexus block, pancreatic cyst drainage, biliary access",
      "Wall layers: mucosa (1&2), submucosa (3), muscularis propria (4), serosa/adventitia (5)"
    ],
    "statement": "EUS provides high-resolution imaging of GI wall layers and adjacent structures for cancer staging and characterization of submucosal lesions, with the added capability of tissue acquisition and therapeutic interventions.",
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Think of EUS as putting an ultrasound probe right next to the area of interest from inside the GI tract. Just as an obstetrician gets better images with a transvaginal ultrasound than abdominal, the endosonographer gets exquisitely detailed images by placing the probe millimeters from the target instead of imaging through skin, fat, and bowel gas.",
      "key_insight": "EUS excels in two scenarios: (1) determining how deep a tumor invades (T-stage) because it can distinguish individual wall layers, and (2) accessing lesions that are difficult to biopsy externally, like a pancreatic mass behind the stomach. The ability to biopsy under real-time guidance while avoiding blood vessels is a major advantage.",
      "technical_details": "Radial EUS provides 360° cross-sectional view (like CT slice) for orientation and staging. Linear EUS provides sagittal view in line with scope for FNA guidance. Frequencies 5-12 MHz; higher = better resolution but less penetration. Normal wall layers: hypoechoic/hyperechoic pattern from lumen outward."
