    "key_points": [
      "Bleeding distal to ligament of Treitz: small bowel, colon, rectum, anus",
      "Diverticulosis is most common cause (30-40%); bleeding is usually painless and self-limited",
      "Hematochezia (bright red blood per rectum) is typical; melena suggests slower upper or proximal source",
      "Rule out upper GI source if hemodynamically unstable (15% of brisk UGIB presents as hematochezia)",
      "Colonoscopy is diagnostic modality of choice; timing depends on severity",

    "statement": "Lower gastrointestinal bleeding (LGIB) is hemorrhage from the GI tract distal to the ligament of Treitz, typically presenting with hematochezia, requiring systematic evaluation to identify the source and determine appropriate intervention.",
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "When blood appears fresh and red in the stool, it's usually from somewhere close to the exit - the colon, rectum, or anus. The most common culprits are outpouchings of the colon wall (diverticula) that erode into arteries, or abnormal blood vessels (angiodysplasia) that bleed.",
      "key_insight": "The key challenge in LGIB is that most bleeding stops spontaneously, making it harder to localize the source. However, when bleeding is brisk, always rule out an upper GI source first (even hematochezia can be from massive UGIB). Colonoscopy after prep is best for stable patients; angiography for active, ongoing bleeding.",
      "technical_details": "LGIB pathophysiology varies: Diverticula form at sites of vasa recta penetration (weakest point), and arterial bleeding occurs from erosion at the dome or neck. Angiodysplasia are ectatic, tortuous blood vessels in the mucosa/submucosa, often in the right colon. Ischemic colitis causes watershed mucosal injury at the splenic flexure. Hemorrhoids cause painless, bright red bleeding separate from stool."
