    "title": "Ischemic Colitis",
    "summary": "Ischemic colitis is the most common form of intestinal ischemia, resulting from transient reduction in colonic blood flow. It typically affects the watershed areas (splenic flexure, rectosigmoid junction) in elderly patients with atherosclerosis. Most cases are non-gangrenous and self-limited, but severe cases may progress to gangrene requiring surgical intervention.",
    "key_points": [
      "Most common form of intestinal ischemia; typically affects elderly with atherosclerosis",
      "Watershed areas most vulnerable: splenic flexure, rectosigmoid junction",
      "Classic triad: crampy abdominal pain, urgent defecation, bloody diarrhea within 24 hours",
      "CT: segmental colonic wall thickening, thumbprinting; colonoscopy: edema, hemorrhagic mucosa, ulceration",
      "Most cases (80-85%) are non-gangrenous and self-limited; supportive treatment",
      "Surgery for peritonitis, perforation, gangrene, or clinical deterioration despite treatment"
    ],
    "statement": "Ischemic colitis is usually a self-limited condition requiring supportive care, but clinicians must recognize warning signs of gangrene or perforation that necessitate surgical intervention.",
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "The colon receives blood from the SMA (right/transverse) and IMA (left/sigmoid). Watershed areas at the boundaries of these vascular territories (splenic flexure, rectosigmoid) are most susceptible to ischemia during low-flow states. Unlike acute mesenteric ischemia (arterial occlusion), ischemic colitis usually results from transient hypoperfusion in patients with underlying vascular disease.",
      "key_insight": "Ischemic colitis should be distinguished from acute mesenteric ischemia (small bowel, more severe, higher mortality). Right-sided ischemic colitis (SMA territory) is a more severe variant with higher mortality. The rectum is typically spared because of dual blood supply from IMA and internal iliac artery.",
      "technical_details": "Diagnosis: CT with IV contrast shows segmental wall thickening, 'thumbprinting' (submucosal hemorrhage/edema), pericolonic stranding. Colonoscopy (after stabilization) shows edematous pale mucosa, submucosal hemorrhage, ulceration; biopsies show mucosal necrosis. Severity: mild (mucosal), moderate (muscular), severe (transmural/gangrenous)."

    "pathophysiology": {
      "mechanism": "Ischemic colitis results from transient reduction in colonic blood flow, often in the setting of systemic hypotension, cardiac arrhythmia, or low-flow states in patients with underlying atherosclerosis. Watershed areas are most vulnerable. Reperfusion after ischemia contributes to injury through reactive oxygen species. Severity depends on duration and degree of ischemia.",
      "key_pathways": [
        "Low-flow state + atherosclerosis → reduced colonic perfusion",
        "Watershed areas most susceptible → splenic flexure, rectosigmoid",
        "Mucosal ischemia → edema, hemorrhage → crampy pain, bloody diarrhea",

      ],
      "clinical_significance": "Most cases are self-limited (80-85%), but gangrenous ischemic colitis has high mortality (50%). Right-sided involvement suggests more severe ischemia and worse prognosis. Early recognition of peritonitis is critical."
