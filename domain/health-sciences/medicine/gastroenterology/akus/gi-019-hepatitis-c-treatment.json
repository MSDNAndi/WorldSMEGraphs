    "title": "Hepatitis C Treatment",
    "summary": "Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is now curable with direct-acting antivirals (DAAs). Pan-genotypic regimens like sofosbuvir/velpatasvir achieve >95% sustained virologic response (SVR12) across all genotypes. Treatment is recommended for all HCV-infected patients except those with limited life expectancy. SVR12 (undetectable HCV RNA 12 weeks post-treatment) represents cure.",
    "key_points": [
      "Direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) cure >95% of HCV infections",
      "Pan-genotypic regimens eliminate need for genotype testing in most cases",
      "SVR12 = undetectable HCV RNA 12 weeks after treatment completion = cure",
      "All HCV patients should be treated regardless of fibrosis stage",
      "Sofosbuvir/velpatasvir 12 weeks is a common first-line pan-genotypic regimen",
      "Post-SVR surveillance for HCC required if cirrhosis present at treatment"
    ],
    "statement": "Hepatitis C treatment with direct-acting antivirals achieves cure (SVR12) in >95% of patients with 8-12 week regimens, representing one of the most significant advances in modern medicine.",
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Think of the HCV lifecycle as a factory with specific machinery. DAAs are like precise sabotage - NS5B polymerase inhibitors (sofosbuvir) stop viral replication, NS5A inhibitors (velpatasvir) block viral assembly, and NS3/4A protease inhibitors (glecaprevir) prevent protein processing. Hit multiple targets and the virus can't survive.",
      "key_insight": "The HCV treatment paradigm has completely changed. Previously, interferon-based therapy had ~50% cure rates with terrible side effects over 48 weeks. Now, oral pills for 8-12 weeks cure >95% with minimal side effects. The barrier is primarily cost and access, not efficacy.",
      "technical_details": "HCV has 6 major genotypes. Pan-genotypic regimens (sofosbuvir/velpatasvir, glecaprevir/pibrentasvir) work across all genotypes. Treatment duration may be shortened to 8 weeks in treatment-naive non-cirrhotic patients. Decompensated cirrhosis requires ribavirin-containing regimens. NS3/4A inhibitors (glecaprevir) contraindicated in decompensated cirrhosis."
