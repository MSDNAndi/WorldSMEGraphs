    "statement": {
      "text": "Liver biopsy is the gold standard for histological diagnosis of liver disease and accurate fibrosis staging. Percutaneous biopsy under ultrasound guidance is the most common approach, while transjugular biopsy is preferred in patients with coagulopathy or ascites. The procedure carries risks of bleeding, pain, and rarely perforation. Non-invasive fibrosis assessments (transient elastography, serum biomarkers) have reduced the need for biopsy in many chronic liver diseases but cannot replace histology for certain diagnoses.",
      "formal": "Liver Biopsy = Percutaneous (most common) OR Transjugular (coagulopathy) OR Laparoscopic + Histological analysis for diagnosis + fibrosis staging"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Liver blood tests and imaging can tell us the liver is unhealthy, but they can't tell us exactly why or how much scarring has occurred. A biopsy provides a tissue sample that a pathologist examines under a microscope—this is like sending a detective to the scene of the crime to gather direct evidence. New non-invasive tests can estimate fibrosis, but biopsy remains essential for complex diagnoses.",
      "key_insight": "Non-invasive fibrosis testing (FibroScan, FIB-4) has transformed practice—liver biopsy is no longer routine for staging chronic hepatitis B/C or NAFLD. However, biopsy remains essential when: (1) non-invasive tests are discordant, (2) rare or overlapping conditions are suspected, (3) histology will change management, (4) post-transplant rejection is suspected.",
      "technical_details": "Percutaneous biopsy: 14-18 gauge needle, intercostal approach under US guidance, 1-3 passes. Transjugular: catheter via jugular vein into hepatic vein, core needle through vein wall; allows simultaneous hepatic venous pressure measurement. Sample adequacy: ≥15 mm length, ≥11 portal tracts for accurate staging. Metavir and Batts-Ludwig systems for fibrosis scoring. Hold anticoagulants per guidelines."
