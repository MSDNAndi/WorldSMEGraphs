    "title": "Peptic Ulcer Disease",
    "summary": "Peptic ulcer disease (PUD) encompasses gastric and duodenal ulcers caused by disruption of mucosal defense against gastric acid. The two major etiologies are Helicobacter pylori infection and NSAID use. Treatment involves acid suppression with PPIs, H. pylori eradication if infected, and avoidance of NSAIDs.",
    "key_points": [
      "Two major causes: H. pylori (decreasing) and NSAIDs (increasing) account for >90%",
      "Duodenal ulcer: Epigastric pain 2-3 hours after eating, relieved by food",
      "Gastric ulcer: Pain with eating; always biopsy to rule out malignancy",
      "H. pylori testing: Urea breath test, stool antigen, or biopsy",
      "Treatment: PPI + H. pylori eradication if positive; stop NSAIDs if possible",
      "Alarm features: Bleeding, perforation, obstruction, malignancy concern"
    ],
    "statement": "Peptic ulcer disease results from imbalance between mucosal defense and acid-peptic injury, primarily caused by H. pylori or NSAIDs, treated with acid suppression and addressing the underlying cause.",
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Think of the stomach lining as a fortress with multiple layers of defense (mucus, bicarbonate, blood flow). H. pylori bacteria burrow into the mucus and cause chronic inflammation, weakening the walls. NSAIDs directly damage the defenses by blocking protective prostaglandins. Acid then erodes through the weakened fortress wall, creating an ulcer crater.",
      "key_insight": "The clinical difference between duodenal and gastric ulcers reflects their pathophysiology. Duodenal ulcers result from acid hypersecretion - food buffers the acid, relieving pain. Gastric ulcers result from impaired defense - food triggers acid secretion, worsening pain. ALL gastric ulcers should be biopsied because cancer can mimic a benign ulcer.",
      "technical_details": "H. pylori produces urease, converting urea to ammonia to buffer gastric acid. CagA+ strains more pathogenic. NSAIDs inhibit COX-1 → decreased prostaglandin synthesis → reduced mucus, bicarbonate, and blood flow. Zollinger-Ellison syndrome (gastrinoma) causes refractory ulcers through acid hypersecretion."
