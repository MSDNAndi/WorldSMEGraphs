    "statement": {
      "text": "Gastric cancer is predominantly adenocarcinoma (90-95%), classified by Lauren histology as intestinal (associated with H. pylori and atrophic gastritis) or diffuse (younger patients, CDH1 mutations). Risk factors include H. pylori infection, dietary factors, and genetic syndromes. Patients typically present with advanced disease due to vague early symptoms. Curative treatment involves gastrectomy with adequate lymphadenectomy plus perioperative chemotherapy. Prognosis depends on stage at diagnosis.",
      "formal": "Gastric Cancer = Adenocarcinoma of stomach = EGD + Biopsy + CT/EUS staging + Gastrectomy (if resectable) + Perioperative chemo"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Gastric cancer is often caught late because early symptoms mimic common conditions like indigestion. By the time red flags appear (weight loss, vomiting, bleeding), the tumor is often advanced. H. pylori causes chronic inflammation that, over decades, can progress through atrophic gastritis, intestinal metaplasia, and dysplasia to cancer—this is the 'intestinal' pathway. The 'diffuse' type skips these steps and occurs in younger patients, often due to genetic mutations.",
      "key_insight": "The Lauren classification has clinical implications: intestinal-type is better differentiated, more common in elderly, associated with environmental risk factors, and has better prognosis. Diffuse-type (signet ring cells, linitis plastica) is poorly differentiated, occurs in younger patients, may be hereditary (CDH1), and has worse prognosis.",
      "technical_details": "TNM staging: T1 (mucosa/submucosa), T2 (muscularis propria), T3 (subserosa), T4a (serosa), T4b (adjacent structures). Lymph node involvement is strongest prognostic factor. D2 lymphadenectomy (removal of N1 and N2 nodes) is standard. EUS assesses T stage; CT/PET for distant metastases. FLOT regimen (5-FU, leucovorin, oxaliplatin, docetaxel) is current standard perioperative chemotherapy."
