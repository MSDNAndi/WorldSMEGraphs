    "summary": "Acute inflammation of the pancreas with autodigestion by pancreatic enzymes, most commonly caused by gallstones or alcohol, requiring aggressive fluid resuscitation and supportive care",
    "key_points": [
      "Diagnosis requires 2 of 3 criteria: typical pain, lipase >3× ULN, imaging findings",
      "Gallstones (40%) and alcohol (30%) account for 70% of cases ('I GET SMASHED' mnemonic for causes)",
      "Aggressive IV fluid resuscitation (250-500 mL/hr crystalloid) in first 24h improves outcomes",
      "Severity classification: Mild (no organ failure/complications), Moderate (transient OF <48h), Severe (persistent OF)",
      "Early enteral nutrition preferred; NPO only if intolerant or severe ileus",
      "Cholecystectomy during same admission for mild biliary pancreatitis to prevent recurrence",

    "statement": "Acute pancreatitis is an inflammatory condition of the pancreas diagnosed by characteristic abdominal pain, elevated lipase, and/or imaging findings, requiring aggressive early fluid resuscitation and severity-based management.",
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "The pancreas produces powerful digestive enzymes normally kept inactive until reaching the duodenum. In pancreatitis, these enzymes activate prematurely within the pancreas, digesting pancreatic tissue and triggering severe inflammation that can spread systemically.",
      "key_insight": "The key to pancreatitis management is aggressive early fluid resuscitation (the pancreatic inflammation causes massive third-spacing), early enteral nutrition (maintains gut barrier function), and identifying the cause (gallstones need cholecystectomy; alcohol needs counseling).",
      "technical_details": "Pancreatitis pathophysiology involves premature activation of trypsinogen to trypsin within acinar cells, which then activates other digestive enzymes causing autodigestion. The systemic inflammatory response can progress to organ failure (ARDS, AKI, shock). The revised Atlanta classification stratifies severity by presence and duration of organ failure."
