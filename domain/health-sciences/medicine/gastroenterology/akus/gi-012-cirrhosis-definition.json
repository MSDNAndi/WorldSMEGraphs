    "statement": "Cirrhosis is the end-stage of chronic liver disease characterized by diffuse fibrosis and nodular regeneration leading to portal hypertension, synthetic dysfunction, and increased mortality requiring systematic management of complications and evaluation for transplantation.",
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Think of cirrhosis as a scarred, stiff liver that has lost its normal architecture. The scarring (fibrosis) blocks blood flow, creating back-pressure (portal hypertension) that causes varices and ascites. The damaged liver cells can't make proteins (albumin, clotting factors) or clear toxins (ammonia).",
      "key_insight": "Cirrhosis represents a transition from 'compensated' (no major complications, reasonable survival) to 'decompensated' (ascites, variceal bleeding, encephalopathy, jaundice - much worse prognosis). The goal is to prevent decompensation, manage complications aggressively, and evaluate for transplant.",
      "technical_details": "Fibrosis results from chronic hepatocyte injury → stellate cell activation → collagen deposition → sinusoidal capillarization → increased intrahepatic resistance → portal hypertension. HVPG (hepatic venous pressure gradient) >10 mmHg = clinically significant portal hypertension; >12 mmHg = variceal risk. MELD = 9.57 × ln(creatinine) + 3.78 × ln(bilirubin) + 11.2 × ln(INR) + 6.43 (constants vary by formula version)."
