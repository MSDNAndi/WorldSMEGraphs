    "title": "Chronic Pancreatitis",
    "summary": "Chronic pancreatitis is a progressive inflammatory disorder characterized by irreversible destruction of pancreatic parenchyma leading to exocrine and endocrine insufficiency. The most common cause is chronic alcohol use. Management focuses on pain control, pancreatic enzyme replacement, and addressing complications.",
    "key_points": [
      "Progressive fibrosis with loss of exocrine (enzymes) and endocrine (insulin) function",
      "Alcohol (70-80%) and smoking are major risk factors",
      "Classic triad: Chronic epigastric pain, steatorrhea, diabetes mellitus",
      "Diagnosis: CT showing calcifications; MRCP/EUS for early disease",
      "Treatment: Pain management, enzyme replacement (PERT), diabetes control",
      "Complications: Pseudocyst, CBD obstruction, splenic vein thrombosis, pancreatic cancer"
    ],
    "statement": "Chronic pancreatitis causes progressive pancreatic damage with irreversible loss of exocrine and endocrine function, requiring multidisciplinary management of pain, malabsorption, and diabetes while monitoring for complications.",
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Think of chronic pancreatitis as the pancreas slowly scarring itself to death from repeated injury. Unlike acute pancreatitis where the pancreas can heal, chronic pancreatitis is like a house that has been damaged so many times it's now permanently structurally unsound. The factories inside (enzyme-producing and insulin-producing cells) are destroyed and replaced by scar tissue.",
      "key_insight": "The 'burnt-out' phase is important to recognize: paradoxically, as the pancreas is destroyed, PAIN may improve because the inflamed tissue is replaced by non-painful scar tissue. However, malabsorption and diabetes worsen. Don't assume improved pain means disease is better - it may mean the pancreas is now non-functional.",
      "technical_details": "Pathogenesis involves repeated episodes of necrosis-fibrosis (necrosis-fibrosis hypothesis) or oxidative stress from alcohol/metabolites. Calcifications (intraductal stones) are pathognomonic on CT. EUS shows parenchymal (lobularity, stranding, cysts, hyperechoic foci) and ductal (irregularity, dilation, stones) changes."
