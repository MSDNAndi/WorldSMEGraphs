    "title": "Vasopressor Selection in Shock",
    "summary": "Vasopressors are medications used to increase systemic vascular resistance and blood pressure in shock states. Selection depends on shock type and desired hemodynamic effect. Norepinephrine is first-line for most shock types; vasopressin is added as a catecholamine-sparing agent; epinephrine provides both inotropy and vasoconstriction; phenylephrine is a pure vasoconstrictor.",
    "key_points": [
      "Norepinephrine: First-line for septic and most shock types (alpha-1 + mild beta-1)",
      "Vasopressin: Second agent in septic shock (V1 receptor; catecholamine-sparing)",
      "Epinephrine: Anaphylaxis first-line; second/third line for refractory shock",
      "Phenylephrine: Pure alpha-1 agonist; use with caution (may decrease CO)",
      "Dopamine: Generally avoided (increased arrhythmias vs norepinephrine)",
      "Target MAP ≥65 mmHg (may need higher in chronic hypertension)"
    ],
    "statement": "Vasopressor selection should be guided by shock physiology, with norepinephrine as first-line for most shock states, vasopressin as a second agent for refractory septic shock, and specific agents for special situations including epinephrine for anaphylaxis.",
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Think of vasopressors as squeezing the blood vessel 'pipes' to maintain pressure when they're too dilated (sepsis) or when the pump is failing and can't generate enough pressure (cardiogenic). Different drugs squeeze different receptor types with different downstream effects.",
      "key_insight": "SOAP II trial established norepinephrine superiority over dopamine (fewer arrhythmias, lower mortality in cardiogenic shock subgroup). VASST trial showed vasopressin is catecholamine-sparing but doesn't reduce mortality as monotherapy.",
      "technical_details": "Receptor profiles: NE = alpha-1 >> beta-1; vasopressin = V1; epinephrine = beta-1 > alpha-1 > beta-2 (dose-dependent); phenylephrine = pure alpha-1; dopamine = dose-dependent D1/beta-1/alpha-1. Always use central line for vesicant vasopressors when possible."
