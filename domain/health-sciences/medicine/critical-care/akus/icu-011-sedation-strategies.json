    "title": "ICU Sedation Strategies",
    "summary": "Modern ICU sedation emphasizes light sedation, daily awakening trials (SAT), and protocolized approaches to minimize duration of mechanical ventilation, ICU-acquired weakness, and delirium. The ABCDEF bundle integrates sedation management with other evidence-based practices. Key principles include targeting RASS -1 to 0 (light sedation), using sedation scales (RASS, SAS), performing daily SAT paired with spontaneous breathing trials (SBT), and preferring non-benzodiazepine agents (propofol, dexmedetomidine) to reduce delirium risk.",
    "key_points": [
      "Light sedation (RASS -1 to 0) preferred over deep sedation; reduces ventilator days",
      "Daily SAT (spontaneous awakening trial) paired with SBT (spontaneous breathing trial)",
      "RASS (Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale): -5 (unarousable) to +4 (combative)",
      "Dexmedetomidine preferred for delirium prevention; propofol for shorter-term",

    "statement": "ICU sedation strategies prioritize light sedation targeting RASS -1 to 0, daily awakening trials, non-benzodiazepine agents, and integration with the ABCDEF bundle to reduce ventilator days, delirium, and ICU-acquired weakness.",
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Think of sedation like a dimmer switch, not an on-off switch. Deep sedation was historically used for patient comfort, but we now know keeping patients lightly sedated (just calm enough for comfort and safety) gets them off the ventilator faster and with less brain fog.",
      "key_insight": "The paired SAT+SBT approach is game-changing. Stop sedation (SAT), let the patient wake up, then test if they can breathe on their own (SBT). This coordinated approach reduces ventilator days by 3+ days and mortality. Deep sedation hides readiness for extubation.",
      "technical_details": "RASS scoring: +4 combative, +3 very agitated, +2 agitated, +1 restless, 0 alert/calm, -1 drowsy, -2 light sedation, -3 moderate sedation, -4 deep sedation, -5 unarousable. SAT pass: patient follows commands. SBT: low pressure support or T-piece for 30-120 minutes. Dexmedetomidine is α2-agonist providing sedation without respiratory depression."
