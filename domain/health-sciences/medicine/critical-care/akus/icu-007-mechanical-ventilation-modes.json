    "title": "Mechanical Ventilation Modes",
    "summary": "Mechanical ventilation modes describe how the ventilator delivers breaths. Key categories include volume-controlled (VC), pressure-controlled (PC), and pressure support (PS) ventilation. Modern modes include SIMV, PRVC, and APRV. Mode selection depends on clinical situation, oxygenation/ventilation goals, and patient comfort.",
    "key_points": [
      "Volume Control (VC): Set TV, variable pressure; guaranteed volume but risk of high pressures",
      "Pressure Control (PC): Set pressure, variable TV; pressure-limited but variable volumes",
      "Pressure Support (PS): Patient-triggered, pressure-assisted; for weaning and spontaneous breathing",
      "SIMV: Synchronizes mandatory breaths with patient effort; used for weaning",
      "AC (Assist-Control): Full support for each breath; most common initial mode",
      "PRVC: Pressure-regulated volume control; hybrid targeting volume with pressure delivery"
    ],
    "statement": "Mechanical ventilation mode selection should match clinical goals: full support (AC) for critically ill, weaning modes (PS, SIMV) as patients improve, and lung-protective settings (low TV, appropriate PEEP) regardless of mode.",
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Think of modes as different driving modes in a car: Volume Control is like cruise control for distance (guaranteed mileage/TV), Pressure Control is like limiting speed (guaranteed not too fast/high pressure), and Pressure Support is like power steering (helps the patient do the driving).",
      "key_insight": "The most important thing is not which mode you use, but how you set it. Lung-protective settings (6 mL/kg IBW, Pplat ≤30) are critical regardless of mode. Most patients can be managed with AC-VC or AC-PC.",
      "technical_details": "In VC, flow pattern determines how volume is delivered (square vs decelerating). In PC, inspiratory time determines delivered volume. PEEP and FiO2 affect oxygenation; RR and TV affect ventilation (CO2 clearance). I:E ratio affects air trapping."
