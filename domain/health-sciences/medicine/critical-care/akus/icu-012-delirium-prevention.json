    "title": "ICU Delirium Prevention and Management",
    "summary": "ICU delirium affects 50-80% of mechanically ventilated patients and is associated with increased mortality, prolonged hospitalization, and long-term cognitive impairment. Prevention is paramount using the ABCDEF bundle: avoiding benzodiazepines, promoting early mobilization, and maintaining sleep hygiene. Assessment uses CAM-ICU or ICDSC. Treatment focuses on addressing underlying causes (infection, metabolic, pain) rather than pharmacologic interventions, as antipsychotics have not shown benefit and carry risks.",
    "key_points": [
      "Prevalence: 50-80% of ventilated patients; increases mortality 3-fold",
      "CAM-ICU: Confusion Assessment Method for ICU; gold standard screening",
      "Prevention: ABCDEF bundle, avoid benzodiazepines, early mobility, sleep hygiene",
      "Types: Hyperactive (10%), Hypoactive (50%), Mixed (40%) - hypoactive most missed",
      "Treatment: Address underlying cause; antipsychotics NOT proven beneficial",
      "Long-term: Associated with persistent cognitive impairment for years"
    ],
    "statement": "ICU delirium is a common complication associated with poor outcomes, prevented through the ABCDEF bundle including benzodiazepine avoidance and early mobility, screened with CAM-ICU, and managed by treating underlying causes rather than routine antipsychotics.",
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Delirium is the brain's 'check engine light' - it signals something is wrong but doesn't tell you exactly what. The brain, especially when sick, is sensitive to insults like infection, medications, and sleep deprivation. Rather than suppressing the signal (antipsychotics), we need to fix the underlying problem.",
      "key_insight": "Hypoactive delirium (quiet, withdrawn) is MORE common than hyperactive (agitated) but is often missed because it doesn't cause management problems. It's equally dangerous. This is why routine screening with CAM-ICU every shift is essential.",
      "technical_details": "Delirium pathophysiology involves neuroinflammation, neurotransmitter imbalance (cholinergic deficiency, dopamine excess), blood-brain barrier disruption, and oxidative stress. CAM-ICU assesses: (1) acute onset/fluctuation, (2) inattention, (3) altered level of consciousness OR (4) disorganized thinking. Positive if 1+2+either 3 or 4."
