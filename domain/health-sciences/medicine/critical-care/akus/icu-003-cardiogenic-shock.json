    "title": "Cardiogenic Shock",
    "summary": "Cardiogenic shock is a state of critical end-organ hypoperfusion due to primary cardiac pump failure. It is characterized by low cardiac output, elevated filling pressures, and systemic hypoperfusion. Acute MI is the most common cause, and mortality remains high (40-50%) despite advances. Early revascularization for MI and hemodynamic support with inotropes and mechanical circulatory support are cornerstones of management.",
    "key_points": [
      "Definition: Cardiac output inadequate for tissue perfusion despite adequate filling pressures",
      "Hemodynamics: Low CI (<2.2 L/min/m²), high PCWP (>15 mmHg), elevated SVR",
      "Most common cause: Acute MI (5-8% of STEMI develops cardiogenic shock)",
      "Clinical: Hypotension, cold extremities, pulmonary edema, altered mental status",
      "Treatment: Inotropes (dobutamine), vasopressors, early revascularization if AMI",
      "Mechanical circulatory support: IABP, Impella, VA-ECMO for refractory cases"
    ],
    "statement": "Cardiogenic shock results from acute pump failure causing inadequate tissue perfusion, diagnosed by low cardiac output with elevated filling pressures, managed with hemodynamic support and urgent revascularization when caused by acute coronary syndromes.",
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "The heart is a failing pump that cannot push blood forward. Fluid backs up into the lungs (pulmonary edema) while the body is underperfused (cold extremities, oliguria). Unlike septic shock where you give lots of fluids, here extra fluid makes it worse. You need to help the pump work better (inotropes) or temporarily replace it (MCS).",
      "key_insight": "The vicious cycle of cardiogenic shock: low CO → hypotension → decreased coronary perfusion → worsening ischemia → further decreased CO. Breaking this cycle requires inotropes/vasopressors for immediate stabilization and revascularization (PCI) for definitive treatment in MI-related shock.",
      "technical_details": "SHOCK trial established early revascularization benefit in MI-related cardiogenic shock. IABP-SHOCK II showed no mortality benefit from routine IABP. Impella and VA-ECMO increasingly used for refractory shock. CI <1.8 L/min/m² indicates severe shock with high mortality."
