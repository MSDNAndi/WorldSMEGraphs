    "title": "Ventilator Weaning and Liberation",
    "summary": "Ventilator weaning is the process of transitioning patients from mechanical ventilation to spontaneous breathing. It involves daily screening for readiness, spontaneous breathing trials (SBT), and extubation when criteria are met. Most patients can be extubated after passing a 30-120 minute SBT. Prolonged weaning failure requires identification and treatment of underlying causes.",
    "key_points": [
      "Daily readiness screening: resolved/improving cause, adequate oxygenation, hemodynamically stable, awake",
      "Spontaneous Breathing Trial (SBT): T-piece or low PS (5-8 cmH2O) for 30-120 min",
      "RSBI (f/Vt) <105 predicts successful weaning",
      "Cuff leak test for upper airway patency if concern for edema",
      "Extubation failure (re-intubation within 48-72h): 10-20%; higher mortality",
      "Causes of weaning failure: cardiac, respiratory, neuromuscular, psychological"
    ],
    "statement": "Ventilator liberation requires systematic daily screening, spontaneous breathing trials when criteria are met, and extubation following successful SBT, with attention to factors that may cause weaning failure.",
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Think of weaning like training wheels on a bike - you gradually reduce support and test if the patient can breathe independently. The SBT is the 'test ride' where you see if they can manage on their own. If they pass, remove the tube.",
      "key_insight": "The longer patients stay on the ventilator, the worse outcomes. Daily awakening trials + SBT (ABC trial) reduced ventilator days. Sedation interruption is as important as ventilator weaning.",
      "technical_details": "RSBI = respiratory rate / tidal volume (in liters). <105 breaths/min/L suggests likely success. SBT can be done with T-piece (no support), CPAP 5 cmH2O, or PS 5-8 + PEEP 5. All approaches have similar predictive value."
