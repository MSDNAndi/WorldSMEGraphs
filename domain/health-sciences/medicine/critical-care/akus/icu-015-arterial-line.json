    "title": "Arterial Line Placement and Monitoring",
    "summary": "Arterial catheters provide continuous blood pressure monitoring and easy arterial blood gas sampling in hemodynamically unstable patients. Common sites include radial (preferred), femoral, and brachial arteries. Waveform analysis provides diagnostic information beyond systolic/diastolic pressures. Complications include thrombosis, infection, and bleeding. Proper zeroing, leveling, and maintenance prevent inaccurate readings.",
    "key_points": [
      "Indications: Hemodynamic instability, frequent ABGs, inaccurate NIBP",
      "Radial artery preferred: Accessible, collateral circulation (Allen test), low complication rate",
      "Femoral artery: Larger, easier cannulation; higher infection risk",
      "Waveform analysis: Dicrotic notch (aortic valve closure), pulse pressure variation (fluid responsiveness)",
      "Zero at phlebostatic axis (4th ICS, mid-axillary); level with transducer",
      "Complications: Thrombosis, hematoma, infection, distal ischemia (rare)"
    ],
    "statement": "Arterial lines enable continuous blood pressure monitoring and frequent blood sampling in critically ill patients, with radial artery as preferred site, proper transducer positioning for accuracy, and waveform analysis providing additional hemodynamic data.",
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "An arterial line gives you a real-time blood pressure reading with every heartbeat. Unlike a cuff that squeezes periodically, you see the actual pressure wave - the upstroke when the heart contracts, the downstroke as it relaxes, and the little bump (dicrotic notch) when the aortic valve closes.",
      "key_insight": "The arterial waveform tells you more than just numbers. A narrow waveform with low dicrotic notch suggests vasoconstriction. A wide, bounding waveform suggests vasodilation. Pulse pressure variation with breathing predicts fluid responsiveness - if the systolic pressure swings big with ventilator breaths, the patient is likely volume responsive.",
      "technical_details": "Modified Allen test assesses collateral ulnar flow. Cannulation via direct puncture or Seldinger technique. Transducer must be zeroed to atmospheric pressure at phlebostatic axis. Arterial waveform components: systolic upstroke, peak systolic pressure, dicrotic notch, diastolic pressure. Normal waveform sharpens distally (peripheral amplification)."
