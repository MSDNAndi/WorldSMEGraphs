    "title": "Hemodynamic Monitoring in Critical Care",
    "summary": "Hemodynamic monitoring in the ICU ranges from basic vital signs to advanced cardiac output measurement. The goal is assessing tissue perfusion adequacy and guiding resuscitation. Monitoring modalities include non-invasive (NIBP, pulse oximetry, echocardiography), minimally invasive (arterial line, pulse contour analysis), and invasive (PAC). Modern approaches favor less invasive techniques when possible, using dynamic parameters (PPV, SVV, PLR) to predict fluid responsiveness rather than static pressures (CVP).",
    "key_points": [
      "Goal: Assess tissue perfusion and oxygen delivery adequacy",
      "Basic: Heart rate, blood pressure, urine output, lactate",
      "Arterial line: Continuous BP, waveform analysis, frequent ABGs",
      "CVP: Poor predictor of fluid responsiveness; use dynamic parameters instead",
      "Cardiac output: Thermodilution (PAC), pulse contour (FloTrac, PiCCO), echo",
      "Dynamic parameters: PPV, SVV, PLR predict fluid responsiveness better than CVP"
    ],
    "statement": "Hemodynamic monitoring in critical care integrates clinical assessment, laboratory values, and technology-based measurements to evaluate perfusion adequacy, with modern emphasis on dynamic parameters over static pressures for guiding fluid resuscitation.",
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Hemodynamic monitoring answers the fundamental question: Is this patient's circulation delivering enough oxygen to their tissues? We use a ladder of monitoring intensity - from looking at the patient, to checking vital signs, to placing invasive monitors - based on how sick the patient is and how certain we need to be.",
      "key_insight": "CVP was once considered the key to fluid management, but studies show it's a poor predictor of fluid responsiveness. Dynamic parameters that measure the heart's response to volume changes (like watching blood pressure swing with ventilator breaths) are much better at predicting who will improve with fluids.",
      "technical_details": "Cardiac output = HR × SV. Oxygen delivery (DO2) = CO × CaO2. Oxygen consumption (VO2) measured by Fick principle. Pulse contour analysis estimates SV from arterial waveform analysis. PPV = (PPmax - PPmin) / PPmean × 100; >13% suggests fluid responsiveness in ventilated patients."
