    "summary": "Hyperglycemia is common in critically ill patients due to stress hormones, medications, and nutritional support, and is associated with worse outcomes. However, the landmark NICE-SUGAR trial showed that tight glucose control (80-110 mg/dL) increased mortality compared to conventional targets (140-180 mg/dL) due to hypoglycemia. Current guidelines recommend targeting blood glucose 140-180 mg/dL, using IV insulin infusions in ICU, and avoiding hypoglycemia (<70 mg/dL) which independently worsens outcomes.",

      "NICE-SUGAR trial: Tight control (80-110) INCREASED mortality vs conventional (140-180)",

    "statement": "ICU glycemic management targets blood glucose 140-180 mg/dL using IV insulin infusions, avoiding both marked hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia, based on NICE-SUGAR trial evidence that tight glucose control increases mortality.",
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "High blood sugar in sick patients was once treated aggressively, assuming that 'normal is always better.' But the body raises blood sugar during stress for a reason - it's fuel for the fight. Pushing it too low causes hypoglycemia, which damages the brain and heart. The sweet spot is in the middle: not too high, not too low.",
      "key_insight": "NICE-SUGAR was a game-changer. Before it, many ICUs chased 'normal' glucose (80-110 mg/dL). The trial showed this increased mortality by 14% - mostly from hypoglycemia. Now we know moderate hyperglycemia (140-180) is safer than tight control.",
      "technical_details": "Stress response increases cortisol, catecholamines, glucagon, and growth hormone, all raising glucose. Insulin resistance develops in peripheral tissues. Hyperglycemia impairs neutrophil function and wound healing. Hypoglycemia triggers catecholamine surge, arrhythmias, and neuroglycopenia. Point-of-care glucose meters may be inaccurate in shock (arterial sampling preferred)."
