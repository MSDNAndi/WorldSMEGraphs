    "title": "Pain Assessment in the ICU",
    "summary": "Pain affects 50-80% of ICU patients and is frequently undertreated due to communication barriers. Modern critical care emphasizes 'analgesia-first' approaches, using validated behavioral pain scales (BPS, CPOT) for non-communicative patients. Self-report remains gold standard when possible. Multimodal analgesia combining opioids with non-opioid adjuncts (acetaminophen, gabapentinoids, regional anesthesia) reduces opioid exposure and side effects. Adequate pain control reduces delirium, facilitates ventilator weaning, and improves outcomes.",

      "Self-report is gold standard; use 0-10 numeric scale when patient can communicate",
      "BPS and CPOT for non-communicative patients; validated behavioral scales",
      "Analgesia-first: treat pain BEFORE adding sedation",

    "statement": "ICU pain assessment uses self-report when possible and validated behavioral scales (BPS, CPOT) when not, with analgesia-first multimodal approaches reducing opioid exposure, delirium, and ventilator days.",
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Pain is often invisible in sedated ICU patients - they can't tell us they hurt. Using behavioral signs (facial expression, body movements, ventilator fighting) through validated scales gives us eyes to see pain. Treating pain first often reduces the need for sedation.",
      "key_insight": "The 'analgesia-first' paradigm is game-changing. Many patients labeled as 'agitated' are actually in pain. Treating pain before reaching for sedatives reduces medication exposure, shortens ventilator time, and decreases delirium. Pain drives the stress response.",
      "technical_details": "BPS (Behavioral Pain Scale) scores facial expression, upper limb movements, and ventilator compliance (3-12 scale; ≥5 suggests pain). CPOT (Critical Care Pain Observation Tool) adds vocalization and muscle tension (0-8 scale; ≥3 suggests pain). Both validated in intubated patients unable to self-report."
