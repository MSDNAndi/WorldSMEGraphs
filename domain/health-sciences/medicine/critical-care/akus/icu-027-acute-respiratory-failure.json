    "title": "Acute Respiratory Failure",
    "summary": "Acute respiratory failure is the inability to maintain adequate gas exchange with sudden onset, classified as hypoxemic (Type 1), hypercapnic (Type 2), or combined, requiring systematic evaluation of etiology and appropriate ventilatory support.",
    "key_points": [
      "Type 1 (hypoxemic): PaO2 <60 mmHg on room air; caused by V/Q mismatch, shunt, or diffusion impairment",
      "Type 2 (hypercapnic): PaCO2 >45 mmHg; caused by inadequate alveolar ventilation",
      "P/F ratio (PaO2/FiO2) <300 indicates respiratory failure; <200 is severe",
      "Workload vs capacity mismatch - respiratory failure occurs when demand exceeds supply",
      "Treatment targets underlying cause while providing supportive ventilation",
      "Escalating support: oxygen, HFNC, NIV, invasive mechanical ventilation, ECMO"
    ],
    "statement": "Acute respiratory failure is the sudden inability to maintain adequate oxygenation, ventilation, or both, classified as Type 1 (hypoxemic - PaO2 <60 mmHg), Type 2 (hypercapnic - PaCO2 >45 mmHg with acidemia), or combined, requiring prompt identification of the underlying etiology and appropriate respiratory support.",
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "The lungs have two jobs: bring oxygen in and get carbon dioxide out. When either function fails acutely, it's respiratory failure. Type 1 is an oxygenation problem (oxygen isn't getting into the blood), while Type 2 is a ventilation problem (CO2 isn't being blown off). Understanding which type helps guide both the workup and the treatment.",
      "key_insight": "Think of respiratory failure as a balance between supply and demand. The respiratory muscles are the pump; the demand is set by metabolism, dead space, and airway resistance. Failure occurs when the pump can't meet demand - either because demand is too high (work of breathing) or supply is too low (muscle weakness, drive issues).",
      "technical_details": "Hypoxemia mechanisms: V/Q mismatch (responds to supplemental O2), shunt (doesn't respond well), diffusion limitation (exercise, altitude), hypoventilation (corrects with ventilation). Hypercapnia occurs when VE < VCO2 production + dead space. The alveolar gas equation relates PAO2 to FiO2 and PaCO2. A-a gradient helps distinguish parenchymal from non-parenchymal causes."
