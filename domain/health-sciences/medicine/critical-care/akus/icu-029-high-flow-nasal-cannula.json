    "title": "High-Flow Nasal Cannula",
    "summary": "High-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) delivers heated, humidified oxygen at flows up to 60 L/min, providing oxygen support, modest PEEP effect, dead space washout, and improved patient comfort for hypoxemic respiratory failure.",
    "key_points": [
      "Delivers heated (37°C), humidified oxygen at flows 30-60 L/min via nasal prongs",
      "Provides ~1 cm H2O PEEP per 10 L/min flow; up to 5-6 cm H2O at 60 L/min",
      "FLORALI trial: reduced intubation in hypoxemic respiratory failure vs standard O2 or NIV",
      "Dead space washout improves ventilation efficiency; reduces rebreathing of CO2",
      "Better tolerated than NIV for many patients; allows eating, speaking, oral care",
      "Monitor for failure: ROX index (SpO2/FiO2 ÷ RR) <3.85 at 12h predicts intubation need"
    ],
    "statement": "High-flow nasal cannula is a respiratory support modality delivering heated, humidified oxygen at flows up to 60 L/min through wide-bore nasal prongs, providing physiologic benefits including precise FiO2 delivery, positive airway pressure, nasopharyngeal dead space washout, and improved mucociliary function for patients with hypoxemic respiratory failure.",
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Traditional nasal cannula delivers dry, cool oxygen at low flows that mix with room air, making actual FiO2 unpredictable. HFNC delivers much higher flows of warm, humidified gas that matches or exceeds the patient's inspiratory demand, ensuring they're actually breathing the prescribed FiO2 and creating a gentle positive pressure in the airways.",
      "key_insight": "HFNC sits in the therapeutic space between standard oxygen and NIV/mechanical ventilation. It's often better tolerated than a mask while providing more support than standard cannula. The key is recognizing when it's enough and when patients need escalation - the ROX index helps predict who will fail.",
      "technical_details": "HFNC uses heated humidifier and specialized wide-bore nasal cannula to deliver 30-60 L/min of blended air/oxygen at 37°C and 100% relative humidity. High flow generates positive pressure in the nasopharynx (~1 cm H2O per 10 L/min with mouth closed). Dead space washout reduces CO2 rebreathing. Precise FiO2 delivery (21-100%) because flow exceeds peak inspiratory demand."
