    "title": "Central Venous Access",
    "summary": "Central venous catheter (CVC) placement is essential for ICU patients requiring vasopressors, TPN, multiple infusions, or reliable access. Site selection (internal jugular, subclavian, femoral) balances infection risk, procedural complications, and patient factors. Ultrasound guidance is now standard of care for IJ and femoral lines, reducing complications. CLABSI prevention uses bundled approaches: chlorhexidine prep, maximal barrier precautions, daily necessity review, and prompt removal when no longer needed.",
    "key_points": [
      "Indications: Vasopressors, TPN, multiple incompatible infusions, no peripheral access, hemodynamic monitoring",
      "Ultrasound guidance mandatory for IJ; reduces complications 50%",
      "Subclavian: Lowest infection rate but highest pneumothorax risk",
      "IJ: Moderate infection risk; lowest pneumothorax; US-guided preferred",
      "Femoral: Easiest in emergencies; highest infection risk; avoid if possible",
      "CLABSI bundle: CHG prep, max barriers, optimal site, daily review, prompt removal"
    ],
    "statement": "Central venous access provides reliable vascular access for critical care interventions, with site selection based on clinical context, mandatory ultrasound guidance for IJ lines, and strict CLABSI prevention bundles reducing catheter-related infections.",
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "A central line is like a highway directly into the large central veins - it can handle medications that would damage smaller peripheral veins (like vasopressors) and provides reliable, long-lasting access. The challenge is getting in safely and keeping it clean.",
      "key_insight": "Ultrasound has been transformative. Real-time visualization reduces arterial punctures by 50%, speeds up insertion, and reduces complications. It's now standard of care for IJ lines. The days of 'landmark only' technique should be over for internal jugular access.",
      "technical_details": "Seldinger technique: Needle access → guidewire → dilator → catheter. Confirm venous placement with manometry, blood gas, or ultrasound before dilation. Standard catheter lengths: IJ 15-17 cm, subclavian 15-17 cm, femoral 20-25 cm. Tip should be at cavoatrial junction or lower SVC. Confirm placement with CXR post-procedure."
