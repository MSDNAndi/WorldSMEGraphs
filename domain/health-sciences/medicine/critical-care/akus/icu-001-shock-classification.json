    "title": "Shock Classification",
    "summary": "Shock is a life-threatening circulatory failure resulting in inadequate oxygen delivery to tissues. It is classified into four mechanistic categories based on hemodynamic profiles: distributive (vasodilatory), cardiogenic (pump failure), hypovolemic (volume loss), and obstructive (flow obstruction). Proper classification guides specific treatment while initial resuscitation addresses tissue perfusion.",
    "key_points": [
      "Shock = inadequate tissue oxygen delivery leading to cellular dysfunction and organ failure",
      "Four categories: Distributive, Cardiogenic, Hypovolemic, Obstructive",
      "Hemodynamic profile (CVP, CO, SVR) distinguishes shock types",
      "Distributive (septic) is most common ICU shock; cardiogenic has highest mortality",
      "Lactate elevation reflects anaerobic metabolism from tissue hypoperfusion",
      "Mixed shock presentations are common; reassess frequently"
    ],
    "statement": "Shock is defined by inadequate tissue perfusion leading to cellular hypoxia, classified by mechanism into distributive, cardiogenic, hypovolemic, and obstructive types, with each requiring distinct hemodynamic interventions guided by clinical and monitored parameters.",
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Think of the circulatory system as a closed loop with a pump (heart), pipes (vessels), and fluid (blood). Shock occurs when: the pump fails (cardiogenic), pipes dilate too much (distributive), fluid leaks out (hypovolemic), or something blocks flow (obstructive). Treatment targets the broken component.",
      "key_insight": "Hemodynamic profiles are the key to classification: low SVR with high CO = distributive; low CO with high filling pressures = cardiogenic; low CO with low filling pressures = hypovolemic; low CO with high JVP but clear lungs = obstructive.",
      "technical_details": "Shock Index (HR/SBP >0.7) suggests hemodynamic compromise. Lactate >2 mmol/L indicates tissue hypoperfusion. Mixed venous O2 saturation <65% reflects increased O2 extraction from inadequate delivery. Echocardiography rapidly distinguishes shock types at bedside."
