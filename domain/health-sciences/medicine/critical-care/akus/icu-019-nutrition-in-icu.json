    "title": "Nutrition Support in the ICU",
    "summary": "Adequate nutrition support is essential for critically ill patients to prevent muscle wasting, immune dysfunction, and impaired wound healing. Early enteral nutrition (within 24-48 hours) is preferred over parenteral nutrition when the gut is functional. Protein requirements are increased (1.2-2.0 g/kg/day). Permissive underfeeding may be beneficial initially. Refeeding syndrome is a dangerous complication when feeding malnourished patients. Guidelines recommend against routine GRV monitoring and support trophic or full feeding based on clinical context.",
    "key_points": [
      "Early enteral nutrition (24-48 hours) preferred if gut functional",
      "Protein: 1.2-2.0 g/kg/day; often higher in critical illness",
      "Calories: 25-30 kcal/kg/day; permissive underfeeding may be acceptable initially",
      "Trophic feeds (10-20 mL/hr) maintain gut integrity even if full feeding not possible",
      "Refeeding syndrome: Phosphate, K, Mg drop when feeding malnourished; start low, go slow",
      "Parenteral nutrition: Reserve for gut failure; start day 7 if EN not possible"
    ],
    "statement": "ICU nutrition prioritizes early enteral feeding within 24-48 hours with adequate protein (1.2-2.0 g/kg/day), monitoring for refeeding syndrome in malnourished patients, and reserving parenteral nutrition for gastrointestinal failure.",
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "The gut is not just for digestion - it's an immune organ. Starving the gut leads to bacterial translocation and immune suppression. Even trickle feeds keep the gut alive and functioning. Think of nutrition as another medication that needs to be dosed carefully.",
      "key_insight": "Protein is more important than total calories in critical illness. Muscle wasting is rapid (up to 1 kg/day) and contributes to prolonged weakness and ventilator dependence. Adequate protein (1.5-2 g/kg/day) may help preserve muscle, while overfeeding calories causes harm.",
      "technical_details": "Calculate IBW for dosing: Males: 50 + 2.3(height in inches - 60); Females: 45.5 + 2.3(height in inches - 60). Energy targets: 25-30 kcal/kg/day (may use indirect calorimetry). Monitor prealbumin (half-life ~2 days) for acute changes. Refeeding syndrome: phosphate drops as cells take up glucose; can cause respiratory failure, arrhythmias."
