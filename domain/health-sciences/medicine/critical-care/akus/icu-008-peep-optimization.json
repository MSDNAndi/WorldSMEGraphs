    "title": "PEEP Optimization",
    "summary": "Positive End-Expiratory Pressure (PEEP) maintains alveolar recruitment and prevents collapse at end-expiration. Optimization balances recruitment benefits against overdistension, hemodynamic compromise, and barotrauma. Strategies include ARDSNet PEEP/FiO2 tables, best compliance titration, driving pressure minimization, and esophageal pressure-guided PEEP.",

    "statement": "PEEP optimization aims to maximize alveolar recruitment while minimizing overdistension and hemodynamic effects, using standardized tables or individualized approaches based on compliance, driving pressure, or transpulmonary pressure measurement.",
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "PEEP acts like a doorstop keeping alveoli open at the end of each breath. Too little PEEP and alveoli collapse (atelectrauma); too much and healthy alveoli are overinflated (overdistension). Finding the 'Goldilocks' PEEP keeps most alveoli open with minimal overdistension.",
      "key_insight": "Driving pressure (Pplat - PEEP) may be the most important parameter. Optimizing PEEP to minimize driving pressure (maximize compliance) individualizes PEEP to patient's lung mechanics.",
      "technical_details": "ARDSNet uses low PEEP/FiO2 and high PEEP/FiO2 tables (no mortality difference in most studies). EPVent-2 used esophageal pressure to titrate PEEP to transpulmonary pressure >0 - no mortality benefit. Decremental PEEP titration after recruitment maneuver is an alternative approach."
