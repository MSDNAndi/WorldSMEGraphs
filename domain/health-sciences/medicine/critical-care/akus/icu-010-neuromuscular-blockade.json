    "title": "Neuromuscular Blockade in the ICU",
    "summary": "Neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBAs) paralyze skeletal muscles by blocking acetylcholine at the neuromuscular junction. In the ICU, they are used for severe ARDS to improve ventilator synchrony, for intubation, and for increased intracranial pressure. Cisatracurium is preferred for infusions due to organ-independent metabolism. Complications include prolonged weakness (ICUAW) and awareness if inadequate sedation.",
    "key_points": [
      "Indications: Severe ARDS (ACURASYS trial), intubation, elevated ICP, refractory shivering",
      "Cisatracurium preferred for infusions (organ-independent Hofmann elimination)",
      "Rocuronium preferred for intubation (rapid onset)",
      "ALWAYS ensure adequate sedation and analgesia before paralysis",
      "Monitor with train-of-four (TOF); target 1-2 twitches",
      "ACURASYS showed mortality benefit; ROSE trial did not replicate - use remains selective"
    ],
    "statement": "Neuromuscular blockade should be reserved for specific indications where paralysis provides clear benefit, with attention to adequate sedation, monitoring, and minimizing duration to reduce ICU-acquired weakness.",
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "NMBAs paralyze patients completely but do NOT provide sedation or pain control - the patient may be fully aware but unable to move. Always sedate deeply before paralyzing. Think of it as removing the body's ability to fight the ventilator in severe ARDS.",
      "key_insight": "The ACURASYS trial (2010) showed mortality benefit with early 48h cisatracurium in severe ARDS. The larger ROSE trial (2019) did not replicate this benefit with current lung-protective practices. Use remains selective for ventilator dyssynchrony despite optimal sedation.",
      "technical_details": "Cisatracurium undergoes Hofmann elimination (spontaneous degradation) independent of renal/hepatic function - preferred for infusion. Succinylcholine is depolarizing (contraindicated in hyperkalemia, burns, denervation). TOF monitoring at ulnar nerve; target 1-2 of 4 twitches for adequate paralysis."
