    "title": "Fluid Responsiveness Assessment",
    "summary": "Fluid responsiveness refers to whether cardiac output will increase meaningfully (typically >10-15%) with fluid administration. Only about 50% of hypotensive ICU patients are fluid responsive. Predicting responsiveness before giving fluids is crucial because unnecessary fluids cause harm (pulmonary edema, organ dysfunction). Dynamic parameters (PPV, SVV, passive leg raise) outperform static measures (CVP) for prediction. The key physiologic concept is Frank-Starling: only patients on the steep portion of the curve will increase SV with preload increase.",
    "key_points": [
      "Fluid responsive: Cardiac output increases ≥10-15% with volume",
      "Only ~50% of hypotensive patients are fluid responsive",
      "Static measures (CVP, PCWP) do NOT predict fluid responsiveness",
      "PPV >13% or SVV >13% predicts responsiveness (in ventilated, Vt ≥8 mL/kg, sinus rhythm)",
      "Passive leg raise: Non-invasive, reversible; works with arrhythmias and spontaneous breathing",
      "Excessive fluids cause harm: pulmonary edema, delayed extubation, AKI"
    ],
    "statement": "Fluid responsiveness assessment determines whether a patient's cardiac output will increase with volume administration, using dynamic parameters like PPV and passive leg raise that outperform static measures like CVP, preventing harmful overresuscitation.",
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Think of the heart like a rubber band on a slingshot. If the band is already stretched tight (full heart), pulling it back more won't launch the projectile further. But if it's loose (empty heart), more stretch means more power. Dynamic parameters test whether the 'rubber band' has room to stretch.",
      "key_insight": "The Frank-Starling curve is the key concept. Patients on the flat portion won't increase cardiac output with fluids - they're already 'full'. Dynamic parameters exploit respiratory variation: if BP swings big with ventilator breaths, the heart is on the steep portion and will respond to fluids.",
      "technical_details": "PPV = (PPmax - PPmin) / PPmean × 100. Requirements for PPV/SVV: mechanical ventilation, Vt ≥8 mL/kg IBW, sinus rhythm, closed chest, no RV failure. PLR technique: from 45° semi-recumbent, lower trunk flat and raise legs to 45°; measure CO/SV change at 1 minute. Mini-fluid challenge: 100 mL over 1 minute; measure VTI change with echo."
