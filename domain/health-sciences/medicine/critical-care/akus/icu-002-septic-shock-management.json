    "title": "Septic Shock Management",
    "summary": "Septic shock is sepsis with circulatory, cellular, and metabolic abnormalities associated with higher mortality. Management follows the Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines: rapid identification, early antibiotics, fluid resuscitation, vasopressors to maintain MAP ≥65 mmHg, and source control. The 'hour-1 bundle' emphasizes time-critical interventions.",
    "key_points": [
      "Definition: sepsis + vasopressor requirement to maintain MAP ≥65 + lactate >2 despite adequate fluids",
      "Hour-1 bundle: lactate, blood cultures, broad-spectrum antibiotics, 30 mL/kg crystalloid, vasopressors if hypotensive",
      "Norepinephrine is first-line vasopressor; add vasopressin as second agent",
      "Source control (drain abscess, remove infected device) is essential within 6-12 hours",
      "Reassess fluid responsiveness - stop fluids when no longer responsive",
      "Stress-dose steroids for refractory shock (hydrocortisone 200 mg/day)"
    ],
    "statement": "Septic shock management requires immediate implementation of the hour-1 bundle with early antibiotics, fluid resuscitation, norepinephrine for vasopressor support, and source control, with ongoing reassessment to titrate therapy and avoid fluid overload.",
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Sepsis is an overwhelming immune response that damages the body's own vessels, causing them to leak and dilate. Blood pressure drops despite the heart pumping faster. Treatment squeezes the pipes back (vasopressors), refills the tank (fluids), kills the invaders (antibiotics), and removes the source (source control).",
      "key_insight": "Speed matters: each hour delay in antibiotics increases mortality. But more fluids aren't always better - after initial resuscitation, assess fluid responsiveness (passive leg raise, IVC variation) before giving more. Overresuscitation causes harm.",
      "technical_details": "Lactate reflects tissue hypoperfusion and is both diagnostic and prognostic. Target lactate clearance >10% in first 6 hours. qSOFA (≥2 of: RR ≥22, altered mentation, SBP ≤100) identifies patients at risk for poor outcomes. Procalcitonin can guide antibiotic de-escalation."
