    "title": "Pulmonary Artery Catheter (Swan-Ganz)",
    "summary": "The pulmonary artery catheter (PAC) is a flow-directed, balloon-tipped catheter that measures right heart pressures, pulmonary artery pressures, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP - estimate of left atrial pressure), and cardiac output via thermodilution. Once widely used, PAC use has declined significantly after RCTs showed no mortality benefit. Current indications are limited to diagnostic uncertainty in complex hemodynamic states, severe pulmonary hypertension management, and perioperative cardiac surgery monitoring.",
    "key_points": [
      "Measures: CVP, PA pressures, PCWP, cardiac output, mixed venous O2 saturation",
      "PCWP estimates left atrial pressure (and thus LVEDP) when balloon wedged",
      "Thermodilution: gold standard cardiac output; cold saline injection technique",
      "No mortality benefit in RCTs (PAC-Man, ESCAPE); use has declined dramatically",
      "Current indications: Diagnostic uncertainty, severe pulmonary hypertension, cardiac surgery",
      "Complications: Arrhythmias, PA rupture, infection, pulmonary infarction"
    ],
    "statement": "The pulmonary artery catheter provides comprehensive hemodynamic data including pressures and cardiac output, but has no proven mortality benefit and is now reserved for specific diagnostic scenarios with hemodynamic complexity.",
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Think of the PAC as a diagnostic journey through the right heart. It floats through the right atrium, right ventricle, and into the pulmonary artery, measuring pressures at each stop. When you inflate the balloon and 'wedge' it, you're looking backwards through the pulmonary circulation at the left atrium.",
      "key_insight": "The PCWP is the key measurement unique to the PAC. When the balloon wedges in a PA branch, forward flow stops, and the pressure measured reflects downstream left atrial pressure. This helps distinguish cardiogenic (high PCWP) from non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema (normal PCWP).",
      "technical_details": "Flow-directed insertion via central vein. Waveform progression: RA (low, venous pattern) → RV (high systolic, low diastolic) → PA (high systolic, elevated diastolic) → PCWP (low, a and v waves). Thermodilution CO: inject cold saline, measure temperature change downstream. CO = volume/area under curve."
