    "statement": {
      "text": "Bronchoscopy is an endoscopic procedure that allows direct visualization of the tracheobronchial tree and sampling of airways and lung tissue. Flexible bronchoscopy is the most common approach, performed with sedation and topical anesthesia. Diagnostic applications include bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) for infections and interstitial lung disease, transbronchial biopsy for peripheral lesions, and direct visualization of endobronchial abnormalities. Therapeutic applications include foreign body removal, airway stent placement, and tumor debulking.",
      "formal": "Bronchoscopy = Airway visualization + Sampling (BAL | Biopsy | Brushings) ± Intervention (FB removal | Stent | Debulking)"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "A bronchoscope is a thin, flexible tube with a camera and working channel that allows pulmonologists to look directly inside the airways, take samples, and perform treatments. It's like a diagnostic and therapeutic 'highway' into the lungs. BAL washes out a segment of lung to collect cells and organisms from deep within the alveoli - useful for diagnosing infections and interstitial diseases. Biopsies sample actual tissue for pathology.",
      "key_insight": "The yield of bronchoscopy depends on lesion location. Central lesions are directly visible and easily biopsied with near 100% yield. Peripheral lesions require fluoroscopic guidance, navigational bronchoscopy, or alternative approaches (CT-guided biopsy) and have lower yield (30-70%). For infections, BAL has higher sensitivity than expectorated sputum because it samples the actual site of disease.",
      "technical_details": "BAL involves wedging the bronchoscope in a subsegmental bronchus and instilling 100-300 mL of saline in aliquots, then recovering the fluid for analysis. Transbronchial biopsy uses forceps passed through the bronchoscope to sample peripheral lung under fluoroscopy. Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) with transbronchial needle aspiration (TBNA) allows sampling of mediastinal lymph nodes for cancer staging."
