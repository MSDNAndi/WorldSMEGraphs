    "statement": {"text": "Aspergillosis encompasses a spectrum of diseases caused by Aspergillus species (most commonly A. fumigatus). Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) occurs in asthmatics and CF patients as a hypersensitivity reaction. Aspergilloma is a fungus ball colonizing a preexisting lung cavity. Chronic pulmonary aspergillosis (CPA) causes progressive lung destruction in immunocompetent hosts with structural lung disease. Invasive aspergillosis is a life-threatening infection in immunocompromised patients, particularly those with prolonged neutropenia. Voriconazole is first-line therapy for invasive disease.", "formal": "Aspergillosis spectrum = ABPA (allergic) | Aspergilloma (colonization) | CPA (chronic) | Invasive (immunocompromised)"},
    "explanation": {"intuition": "Aspergillus spores are everywhere in the environment - we inhale them daily without harm. What happens when spores reach the lungs depends on immune status. In allergic individuals, spores trigger an exaggerated immune response (ABPA). In those with lung cavities from old disease, spores can grow into a fungus ball without invading tissue. In the severely immunocompromised, Aspergillus invades blood vessels and tissue, causing life-threatening infection.", "key_insight": "The clinical manifestation is determined by the immune response: hypersensitivity (ABPA in allergic patients), saprophytic (aspergilloma in cavities), chronic destructive (CPA in structural disease), or invasive angioinvasive (neutropenic, transplant). Treatment differs markedly - steroids for ABPA, antifungals for invasive, surgery for aspergilloma with hemoptysis.", "technical_details": "Galactomannan is a cell wall component detectable in serum and BAL in invasive disease (sensitivity ~70% serum, ~85% BAL). Halo sign (ground-glass halo around nodule from hemorrhage) on CT is early finding of invasive aspergillosis. Voriconazole achieves better outcomes than amphotericin B for invasive disease. Isavuconazole is an alternative with fewer drug interactions."},
