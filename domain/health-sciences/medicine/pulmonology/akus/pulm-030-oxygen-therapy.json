    "title": "Oxygen Therapy",
    "summary": "Oxygen therapy is the administration of supplemental oxygen to treat hypoxemia. Delivery systems range from low-flow (nasal cannula, simple mask) to high-flow (high-flow nasal cannula, venturi mask) and reservoir systems (non-rebreather). Selection depends on oxygen requirements, patient comfort, and need for precise FiO2 control.",
    "key_points": [
      "Nasal cannula: 1-6 L/min delivers approximately 24-44% FiO2; comfortable but imprecise",
      "Venturi mask: delivers precise FiO2 (24-50%) via entrainment; ideal for COPD patients",
      "Non-rebreather: 10-15 L/min with reservoir delivers 80-95% FiO2 for severe hypoxemia",
      "High-flow nasal cannula (HFNC): 30-60 L/min with heated humidity; provides PEEP-like effect and precise FiO2",
      "Target SpO2 88-92% in COPD with chronic hypercapnia to avoid suppressing hypoxic drive",
      "Long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT) improves survival in COPD patients with PaO2 ≤55 mmHg"
    ],
    "statement": "Oxygen is a medication with specific indications, delivery methods, and potential toxicities. Appropriate selection of delivery device and flow rate, guided by target saturation, optimizes oxygenation while minimizing complications.",
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "The goal of oxygen therapy is to maintain adequate tissue oxygenation (SpO2 ≥90% or PaO2 ≥60 mmHg in most patients). The inspired oxygen concentration (FiO2) depends on both the oxygen flow rate and the patient's inspiratory flow. High-flow systems match or exceed patient demand, providing consistent FiO2; low-flow systems mix with room air, varying with breathing pattern.",
      "key_insight": "In COPD patients with chronic hypercapnia, excessive oxygen can suppress hypoxic ventilatory drive and worsen CO2 retention (oxygen-induced hypercapnia). Target SpO2 88-92% in these patients. High-flow nasal cannula provides benefits beyond oxygenation: dead space washout, mild PEEP effect, and improved secretion clearance.",
      "technical_details": "Low-flow NC: each L/min adds ~4% FiO2 (starting at 21%); actual FiO2 varies with tidal volume and RR. Venturi: fixed entrainment ratio ensures precise FiO2. HFNC: flows 30-60 L/min with heated humidity at 31-37°C; FiO2 21-100% adjustable; generates 2-8 cmH2O PEEP with closed mouth."

  "clinical_features": {
    "pathophysiology": {
      "mechanism": "Oxygen supplementation increases alveolar PO2, improving the driving gradient for oxygen diffusion into blood. In V/Q mismatch, increasing FiO2 raises PO2 even in poorly ventilated alveoli. In shunt (completely unventilated alveoli), oxygen therapy is less effective because blood bypasses functioning alveoli. Chronic hypoxemia triggers adaptive mechanisms (increased erythropoietin) but also pulmonary vasoconstriction leading to pulmonary hypertension.",
      "key_pathways": [
        "Supplemental O2 → increased alveolar PO2 → improved diffusion gradient → increased PaO2",
        "In V/Q mismatch → O2 therapy effective → improved oxygenation",
        "In shunt → limited O2 response → blood bypasses ventilated alveoli",
        "Excessive O2 in COPD → suppressed hypoxic drive + worsened V/Q (Haldane effect) → hypercapnia"
