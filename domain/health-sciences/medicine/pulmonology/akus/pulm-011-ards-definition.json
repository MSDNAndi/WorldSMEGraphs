    "title": "Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) - Berlin Definition",
    "summary": "ARDS is a syndrome of acute hypoxemic respiratory failure characterized by bilateral pulmonary infiltrates not fully explained by cardiac failure or fluid overload. The Berlin Definition (2012) classifies severity by PaO2/FiO2 ratio on PEEP ≥5 cmH2O: mild (200-300), moderate (100-200), severe (<100).",
    "key_points": [
      "Berlin Definition requires: acute onset (≤7 days), bilateral infiltrates, hypoxemia (P/F ≤300 on PEEP ≥5), non-cardiogenic",
      "Severity classification: Mild P/F 200-300 (27% mortality); Moderate P/F 100-200 (32% mortality); Severe P/F <100 (45% mortality)",
      "Low tidal volume ventilation (6 mL/kg IBW) with plateau pressure <30 cmH2O is cornerstone therapy",
      "Prone positioning for severe ARDS (P/F <150) reduces mortality by ~16%",
      "Conservative fluid management improves oxygenation and ventilator-free days",
      "Common causes: pneumonia, sepsis, aspiration, trauma, pancreatitis, transfusion-related"
    ],
    "statement": "ARDS represents the severe end of acute lung injury spectrum with high mortality despite advances in supportive care. The Berlin Definition provides standardized criteria for diagnosis and severity stratification, enabling consistent enrollment in clinical trials and prognostication.",
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "ARDS results from diffuse alveolar damage triggered by direct (pulmonary) or indirect (extrapulmonary) insults. The inflammatory response increases alveolar-capillary permeability, flooding alveoli with protein-rich edema fluid, inactivating surfactant, and causing alveolar collapse. This creates right-to-left shunt and refractory hypoxemia.",
      "key_insight": "The P/F ratio standardizes hypoxemia assessment and predicts mortality. However, it must be measured on adequate PEEP (≥5) to avoid underestimating severity. The PEEP requirement was added in Berlin Definition to address this limitation of the prior AECC definition.",
      "technical_details": "PaO2/FiO2 (P/F) ratio calculation: if PaO2 60 on FiO2 0.4 → P/F = 60/0.4 = 150 (moderate ARDS). For mild ARDS, CPAP ≥5 or HFNC is acceptable; moderate-severe requires invasive ventilation with PEEP ≥5."

  "clinical_features": {
    "pathophysiology": {
      "mechanism": "ARDS results from dysregulated inflammatory response causing diffuse alveolar damage. Neutrophil-mediated injury increases alveolar-capillary permeability, allowing protein-rich fluid into alveoli. Surfactant inactivation and alveolar collapse create dependent atelectasis. Pulmonary vasoconstriction increases dead space. The combination of shunt (perfused but unventilated alveoli) and dead space (ventilated but unperfused) impairs both oxygenation and CO2 elimination.",
      "key_pathways": [
        "Initiating insult (sepsis, pneumonia, aspiration) → systemic inflammatory response",
        "Neutrophil activation → release of proteases, ROS, cytokines",

        "Surfactant inactivation → alveolar collapse → atelectasis",
        "V/Q mismatch and shunt → refractory hypoxemia"
      ],
      "clinical_significance": "ARDS mortality remains 30-40% despite decades of research. Lung-protective ventilation is the only intervention with proven mortality benefit. Focus has shifted to preventing ventilator-induced lung injury."
