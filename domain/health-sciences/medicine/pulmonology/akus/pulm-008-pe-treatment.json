    "key_points": ["Anticoagulation is cornerstone of PE treatment for all patients", "Risk stratification guides treatment intensity (low, intermediate, high risk)", "DOACs preferred over warfarin for most patients without contraindication", "Systemic thrombolysis for massive PE with hemodynamic instability", "Catheter-directed therapy emerging for intermediate-high risk", "ECMO/surgical embolectomy for refractory massive PE", "IVC filter only if anticoagulation contraindicated"],
    "statement": {"text": "Pulmonary embolism treatment is risk-stratified. All patients without contraindication receive anticoagulation (DOACs preferred). Low-risk patients may be treated as outpatients. Intermediate-risk patients (RV dysfunction or elevated troponin) require close monitoring and potential escalation. High-risk/massive PE (hemodynamic instability) requires reperfusion therapy: systemic thrombolysis, catheter-directed therapy, or surgical embolectomy. Treatment duration depends on provoked vs unprovoked status.", "formal": "PE Treatment = Anticoagulation (all) + Reperfusion (massive PE) | Duration = 3 months (provoked) | ≥3 months (unprovoked, weigh bleeding risk)"},
    "explanation": {"intuition": "A blood clot blocking pulmonary arteries prevents blood from getting to the lungs for oxygenation. Anticoagulation prevents clot extension and new clot formation while the body's natural fibrinolytic system dissolves the clot. In massive PE where the clot is so large it causes heart failure, we need to actively remove or dissolve the clot (thrombolysis) to prevent death.", "key_insight": "Risk stratification determines treatment intensity. The PESI/sPESI scores identify low-risk patients for outpatient treatment. Troponin and RV dysfunction (echo or CT) identify intermediate-high risk patients who may benefit from closer monitoring or escalated therapy. Hemodynamic instability (SBP <90, vasopressor requirement) defines massive PE requiring reperfusion.", "technical_details": "DOACs (rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban, dabigatran) are preferred over warfarin for ease of use and lower bleeding risk. Thrombolytics (alteplase 100mg over 2h) are indicated for massive PE; half-dose may have similar efficacy with lower bleeding. Catheter-directed thrombolysis delivers lower drug doses directly to clot. PERT (Pulmonary Embolism Response Team) facilitates rapid multidisciplinary decision-making."},
