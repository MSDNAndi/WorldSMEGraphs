    "title": "Smoking Cessation",
    "summary": "Smoking cessation is the most important intervention for preventing tobacco-related disease. A combination of pharmacotherapy (varenicline, NRT, bupropion) and behavioral counseling provides the highest quit rates. All clinicians should use the 5 A's framework (Ask, Advise, Assess, Assist, Arrange) at every patient encounter.",
    "key_points": [
      "Smoking is leading preventable cause of death: COPD, lung cancer, cardiovascular disease",
      "Varenicline is most effective single agent; combination NRT comparable",
      "Combination pharmacotherapy + counseling provides highest quit rates (30-40%)",
      "5 A's: Ask (tobacco use), Advise (quit), Assess (readiness), Assist (intervention), Arrange (follow-up)",
      "Brief advice (<3 min) increases quit rates by 30% compared to no advice",
      "Relapse is common - treat as chronic relapsing condition, not single event"
    ],
    "statement": "Smoking cessation requires combining pharmacotherapy (varenicline preferred) with behavioral counseling, utilizing the 5 A's framework at every clinical encounter, while treating nicotine dependence as a chronic relapsing condition.",
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Think of nicotine addiction as a two-headed monster: physical dependence (nicotine receptors) and behavioral habit (triggers, rituals). Pharmacotherapy attacks the physical head - NRT provides controlled nicotine, varenicline blocks the receptor reward, bupropion addresses mood/craving. Counseling attacks the behavioral head - identifying triggers, developing coping strategies.",
      "key_insight": "Most smokers need MULTIPLE quit attempts before success - typically 4-7 attempts on average, with significant variation. Each attempt should be treated as progress, not failure. Clinicians should ask about tobacco at EVERY visit (not just first) because readiness changes. Brief advice at every visit has cumulative effect.",
      "technical_details": "Nicotine binds α4β2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in the ventral tegmental area, triggering dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens (reward pathway). Varenicline is a partial agonist at α4β2 - provides 40-60% of dopamine response (reducing withdrawal) while blocking nicotine's full effect."
