      "text": "COPD is a heterogeneous lung condition characterized by chronic respiratory symptoms (dyspnea, cough, sputum production) due to airway and/or alveolar abnormalities, with persistent often progressive airflow limitation confirmed by spirometry (post-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC <0.70).",

      "intuition": "COPD is like trying to breathe through a straw that's partially blocked (airway obstruction) while also having fewer bubbles to exchange air (emphysema). The lungs can't fully empty, trapping air and making each breath less efficient.",
      "key_insight": "COPD severity is assessed in two dimensions: (1) physiologic - GOLD 1-4 based on FEV1, and (2) clinical - symptom burden and exacerbation history. Both inform treatment decisions. A patient with mild obstruction but frequent exacerbations may need more aggressive therapy."
