    "title": "Lung Cancer Staging",
    "summary": "Lung cancer staging uses the TNM system for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and limited/extensive staging for small cell lung cancer (SCLC). Accurate staging is essential for prognosis and treatment planning. PET-CT is the primary imaging modality for mediastinal and distant staging, with brain MRI for complete evaluation.",
    "key_points": [
      "TNM 8th edition: T (tumor size/invasion), N (nodal involvement), M (metastases)",
      "NSCLC stages: I-II potentially resectable; IIIA variable; IIIB-IV inoperable",
      "SCLC: Limited (one hemithorax) vs Extensive (beyond one radiation port)",
      "PET-CT sensitivity 85-90% for mediastinal nodes; confirm positive with tissue",
      "Brain MRI for all stage III-IV NSCLC and all SCLC (high brain metastasis rate)",
      "Mediastinoscopy/EBUS-TBNA for pathologic N staging before curative surgery"
    ],
    "statement": "Lung cancer staging determines resectability and treatment approach, using TNM classification for NSCLC and limited/extensive for SCLC, with PET-CT and brain MRI as essential staging tools.",
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Think of lung cancer staging as mapping how far the fire has spread. T tells you how big the original fire is and what local structures it's burning. N tells you if embers have jumped to nearby lymph nodes. M tells you if sparks have landed far away (brain, bones, liver). This map determines whether you can surgically remove the fire (early) or need systemic treatment (advanced).",
      "key_insight": "PET-positive mediastinal nodes MUST be confirmed with tissue before declaring a patient unresectable. PET false-positive rate is 15-20% (especially with inflammatory conditions). Conversely, small nodes may harbor microscopic disease (false-negative). Pathologic confirmation changes management in 20-30% of cases.",
      "technical_details": "AJCC 8th edition T staging: T1 ≤3cm (T1a≤1cm, T1b>1-2cm, T1c>2-3cm); T2 >3-5cm or bronchus/visceral pleura invasion; T3 >5-7cm or chest wall/pericardium/phrenic nerve; T4 >7cm or mediastinal invasion. N1=ipsilateral hilar; N2=ipsilateral mediastinal; N3=contralateral."
