    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Asthma is like having overly sensitive airways that overreact to triggers (allergens, exercise, cold air) by swelling, producing mucus, and squeezing tight. The good news is this bronchoconstriction is usually reversible with treatment.",
      "key_insight": "Unlike COPD, asthma obstruction is variable and reversible. Spirometry shows improvement with bronchodilator (>12% and >200mL FEV1 increase). ICS addresses the underlying inflammation - bronchodilators alone don't treat the cause."
