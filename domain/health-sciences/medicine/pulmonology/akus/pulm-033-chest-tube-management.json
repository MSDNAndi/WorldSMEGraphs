    "title": "Chest Tube Management",
    "summary": "Chest tube (tube thoracostomy) is a critical procedure for drainage of the pleural space. Indications include pneumothorax, hemothorax, pleural effusion requiring drainage, and empyema. Proper management involves understanding water-seal systems, recognizing complications, and determining appropriate timing for removal.",
    "key_points": [
      "Indications: pneumothorax, hemothorax, empyema, large pleural effusions",
      "Insertion site: 4th-5th intercostal space, anterior to mid-axillary line (triangle of safety)",
      "Water-seal chamber: allows air out but prevents re-entry",
      "Continuous tidaling indicates patent tube connected to pleural space",
      "Air leak: bubbling in water-seal chamber during expiration/cough",
      "Removal criteria: air leak resolved, <150-200 mL/day drainage, lung re-expanded"
    ],
    "statement": "Chest tube management encompasses proper insertion, monitoring of water-seal drainage systems, recognizing complications, and determining readiness for removal based on output, air leak status, and lung re-expansion.",
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "A chest tube is like a drain in a bathtub - it removes unwanted fluid or air from the pleural space. The water-seal system acts as a one-way valve: the tube lets stuff out but the water blocks anything from going back in. Bubbling means there's an air leak somewhere; tidaling (water rising and falling with breathing) means the tube is working properly.",
      "key_insight": "The key to chest tube management is understanding what the water-seal chamber is telling you. Continuous bubbling = air leak from the lung. No tidaling = tube clogged or kinked. Bloody output >200 mL/hr may indicate hemothorax requiring surgical exploration.",
      "technical_details": "Three-chamber systems: collection chamber (drains fluid), water-seal chamber (-2 cm H2O acts as one-way valve), suction control chamber (-20 cm H2O suction). Digital systems have replaced traditional water-seal in many centers, providing continuous air leak monitoring."
