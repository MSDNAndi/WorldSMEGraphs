    "summary": "Pleural effusion is accumulation of fluid in the pleural space. Classification as transudative (systemic factors) vs exudative (local pleural disease) using Light's criteria guides etiology and management. Thoracentesis is diagnostic and therapeutic. Empyema and complicated parapneumonic effusions require drainage.",
    "key_points": [
      "Light's criteria distinguish exudate from transudate (any 1 of 3 criteria = exudate)",
      "Transudates: heart failure, cirrhosis, nephrotic syndrome (treat underlying cause)",
      "Exudates: infection, malignancy, PE, rheumatologic disease (investigate cause)",
      "Thoracentesis indicated for new effusions ≥10mm on decubitus or US",
      "Complicated parapneumonic effusion and empyema require drainage",

    "statement": "Pleural effusion diagnosis requires differentiation of transudates (systemic causes) from exudates (local pleural disease) using Light's criteria, followed by targeted workup and management including thoracentesis and drainage when indicated.",
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "The pleural space normally has just a thin film of fluid for lubrication. Excess fluid accumulates either because systemic pressures push fluid in (transudate - like water overflowing from a full bathtub) or because the pleura itself is diseased and leaking protein-rich fluid (exudate - like a wound oozing).",
      "key_insight": "Light's criteria are sensitive (~98%) but can misclassify transudates as exudates in diuretic-treated heart failure patients. If the fluid meets exudate criteria but clinically appears to be heart failure, check the serum-effusion albumin gradient (>1.2 g/dL = transudate) or serum-effusion protein gradient (>3.1 g/dL = transudate).",
      "technical_details": "Light's criteria: Pleural fluid protein/serum protein >0.5, OR pleural fluid LDH/serum LDH >0.6, OR pleural fluid LDH > 2/3 upper limit of normal serum LDH. Meeting any ONE criterion classifies as exudate."
