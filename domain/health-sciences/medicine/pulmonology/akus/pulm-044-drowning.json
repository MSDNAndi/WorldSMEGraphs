    "statement": {
      "text": "Drowning is defined as the process of experiencing respiratory impairment from submersion or immersion in liquid. The primary mechanism of injury is hypoxia from water aspiration or laryngospasm. Management focuses on oxygenation, prevention of secondary lung injury (using lung-protective ventilation), and treatment of complications including pulmonary edema, ARDS, and hypothermia. The distinction between freshwater and saltwater drowning is clinically irrelevant. Prognosis depends on duration of submersion, water temperature, and time to effective CPR.",
      "formal": "Drowning = Submersion/Immersion + Respiratory impairment | Outcome = f(submersion duration, CPR timing, water temperature)"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "When someone's face is submerged in water, they can no longer breathe air. Initially, they may hold their breath or experience reflexive laryngospasm. Eventually, they aspirate water, which damages the lungs directly (washing out surfactant) and prevents gas exchange. The resulting hypoxia is what causes harm - brain injury occurs within minutes of oxygen deprivation. Cold water may slow metabolism and provide some protection, which is why prolonged resuscitation is attempted in hypothermic drowning victims.",
      "key_insight": "The old distinction between 'wet' drowning (aspiration) vs 'dry' drowning (laryngospasm preventing aspiration) has been abandoned, as has the distinction between 'near-drowning' and 'drowning.' The 2002 WHO definition simply uses 'drowning' with outcomes described separately (death, morbidity, no morbidity). Focus should be on hypoxia duration and resuscitation quality rather than water type or aspiration amount.",
      "technical_details": "Aspiration of as little as 1-3 mL/kg of water causes surfactant dysfunction, alveolar collapse, and ventilation-perfusion mismatch. Both fresh and salt water cause similar degrees of lung injury. Fresh water may cause slightly more surfactant washout; salt water slightly more fluid shifts - but these differences are clinically negligible. The 'immersion syndrome' (sudden cardiac arrest from cold water shock) is a distinct entity."

Aspirated water causes direct lung injury through surfactant washout, alveolar epithelial damage, and inflammatory response. This leads to atelectasis, intrapulmonary shunting, ventilation-perfusion mismatch, and hypoxemia. Prolonged hypoxia causes multi-organ injury, particularly to the brain, heart, and kidneys.",
