    "statement": {"text": "Tracheostomy is a surgical procedure creating an opening (stoma) in the anterior trachea for direct airway access, bypassing the upper airway. It is indicated for patients requiring prolonged mechanical ventilation, those with upper airway obstruction, or patients needing improved access for pulmonary toilet. Percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy (PDT) can be performed at bedside in the ICU, while open surgical tracheostomy is done in the operating room. Decannulation is the goal when the underlying condition resolves.", "formal": "Tracheostomy = Surgical tracheal stoma | Indications = Prolonged ventilation >7-14 days OR Airway obstruction OR Secretion management"},
    "explanation": {"intuition": "An endotracheal tube through the mouth is uncomfortable and limits patient mobility, communication, and eating. For patients needing long-term mechanical ventilation, a tracheostomy creates a more comfortable, stable airway directly in the neck. This allows patients to be weaned from sedation, potentially speak (with special valves), and participate more in rehabilitation.", "key_insight": "The timing of tracheostomy remains debated. Early tracheostomy (day 7-10) may reduce sedation needs and ventilator days but doesn't clearly improve mortality. Patient selection matters more than timing - consider tracheostomy early if the patient is clearly going to need prolonged ventilation (e.g., high spinal cord injury, severe brain injury).", "technical_details": "PDT is performed at bedside using Seldinger technique with serial dilators under bronchoscopic guidance. Open surgical tracheostomy requires OR and provides better hemostasis. Tracheostomy tubes have inner cannulas (removable for cleaning), cuffs (for positive pressure ventilation), and come in various sizes and lengths. Speaking valves allow air to pass vocal cords on expiration."},

    "pathophysiology": {"mechanism": "Tracheostomy bypasses upper airway, providing direct tracheal access.
