    "title": "Altitude Sickness (High-Altitude Illness)",
    "summary": "Altitude sickness encompasses a spectrum of hypoxia-related conditions occurring at high altitude: acute mountain sickness (AMS), high-altitude cerebral edema (HACE), and high-altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE). Prevention through gradual acclimatization and pharmacologic prophylaxis (acetazolamide, dexamethasone) is key; treatment requires descent and supportive care.",
    "key_points": [
      "Acute mountain sickness (AMS): headache plus GI symptoms, fatigue, dizziness at >2500m; self-limited",
      "High-altitude cerebral edema (HACE): AMS progression with ataxia and altered consciousness; life-threatening",
      "High-altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE): non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema with dyspnea, cough, hypoxemia; most common cause of altitude-related death",
      "Prevention: gradual ascent (<500m/day above 2500m), acetazolamide 125-250mg BID",
      "Treatment: descent is definitive; oxygen, dexamethasone for HACE; nifedipine for HAPE",
      "Portable hyperbaric chamber (Gamow bag) simulates descent when evacuation not immediately possible"
    ],
    "statement": "High-altitude illness results from the physiologic challenges of hypobaric hypoxia. Understanding the spectrum from AMS to HACE and HAPE enables prevention through appropriate acclimatization protocols and early intervention when symptoms develop.",
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "At altitude, barometric pressure decreases, reducing inspired oxygen partial pressure. The body acclimatizes through hyperventilation, increased erythropoiesis, and altered hemoglobin affinity. When ascent outpaces acclimatization, hypoxia triggers maladaptive responses: cerebral vasodilation (HACE) or exaggerated hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction with capillary leak (HAPE).",
      "key_insight": "HAPE is not cardiogenic edema—it results from uneven hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction creating focal over-perfusion and capillary stress failure. Nifedipine reduces pulmonary artery pressure; descent remains definitive. HACE is vasogenic cerebral edema from blood-brain barrier breakdown.",
      "technical_details": "Lake Louise AMS Score: headache required plus ≥1 of GI symptoms, fatigue/weakness, dizziness; total score ≥3 = AMS. HACE: AMS + ataxia or altered mental status. HAPE: dyspnea at rest, cough (may be pink frothy), crackles, cyanosis, SpO2 much lower than expected for altitude."

    "pathophysiology": {
      "mechanism": "At 5500m, barometric pressure is half sea level, reducing PiO2 from 150 to 75 mmHg. Acclimatization involves: (1) Hyperventilation increases alveolar PO2, (2) Renal HCO3 excretion compensates respiratory alkalosis, (3) EPO increases erythropoiesis. When ascent exceeds acclimatization: AMS from cerebral vasodilation and mild edema; HACE from blood-brain barrier breakdown; HAPE from uneven HPV causing focal capillary stress failure and non-cardiogenic edema.",
      "key_pathways": [
        "Hypobaric hypoxia → chemoreceptor stimulation → hyperventilation → respiratory alkalosis",
