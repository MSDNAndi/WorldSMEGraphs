    "statement": {
      "text": "Tuberculosis treatment employs combination antimicrobial therapy to prevent resistance development. Drug-susceptible pulmonary TB is treated with a 6-month regimen: 2-month intensive phase with RIPE (Rifampin, Isoniazid, Pyrazinamide, Ethambutol) followed by 4-month continuation phase with Rifampin and Isoniazid. Directly observed therapy (DOT) ensures adherence. Pyridoxine supplementation prevents isoniazid neuropathy. Drug-resistant TB requires prolonged treatment with second-line agents based on susceptibility testing.",
      "formal": "Drug-susceptible TB = 2 months RIPE + 4 months RI = 6 months total | MDR-TB = Resistance to R + I"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "TB bacteria are slow-growing and develop resistance easily if exposed to single drugs. Using four drugs simultaneously prevents resistance from emerging - if a bacterium becomes resistant to one drug, the other three will still kill it. The intensive phase with all four drugs rapidly kills the bulk of bacteria, while the continuation phase eliminates remaining dormant organisms. DOT ensures patients take every dose, preventing resistance.",
      "key_insight": "Each drug in the RIPE regimen has a specific role: Isoniazid is the most potent bactericidal drug; Rifampin is critical for sterilization of dormant bacilli; Pyrazinamide is most active against intracellular organisms (used only in intensive phase); Ethambutol protects against INH resistance. Resistance to both Rifampin and Isoniazid defines MDR-TB, which is much harder to treat.",
      "technical_details": "Rifampin induces cytochrome P450 enzymes, causing numerous drug interactions (oral contraceptives, warfarin, HIV medications). Isoniazid is metabolized by acetylation (fast vs slow acetylators affect toxicity risk). Pyrazinamide requires acidic pH for activation (effective in intracellular environment). Ethambutol inhibits arabinosyltransferase affecting cell wall synthesis."
