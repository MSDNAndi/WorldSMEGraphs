    "title": "Pulmonary Vasculitis",
    "summary": "Pulmonary vasculitis encompasses inflammatory disorders affecting pulmonary blood vessels, including ANCA-associated vasculitides (granulomatosis with polyangiitis, microscopic polyangiitis, eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis) and large-vessel vasculitides. Manifestations range from diffuse alveolar hemorrhage to pulmonary nodules and airway disease.",
    "key_points": [
      "ANCA-associated vasculitides (AAV): GPA (PR3-ANCA), MPA (MPO-ANCA), EGPA (variable ANCA)",
      "Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH): hemoptysis, anemia, diffuse infiltrates; classic presentation of capillaritis",
      "GPA: upper/lower respiratory tract granulomas + glomerulonephritis; c-ANCA/PR3 positive in 90%",
      "MPA: pauci-immune glomerulonephritis + DAH; p-ANCA/MPO positive; no granulomas",
      "EGPA: asthma + eosinophilia + vasculitis; mononeuritis multiplex common; ANCA positive in 40%",
      "Treatment: induction with cyclophosphamide or rituximab + glucocorticoids; maintenance with azathioprine or rituximab"
    ],
    "statement": "Pulmonary vasculitis should be suspected in patients with pulmonary infiltrates, hemoptysis, or respiratory failure in the context of systemic symptoms or renal involvement. ANCA testing and tissue biopsy are essential for diagnosis, and treatment requires aggressive immunosuppression.",
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Vasculitis causes vessel wall inflammation leading to luminal narrowing, thrombosis, or rupture. In the lung, small-vessel vasculitis (capillaritis) causes DAH as inflamed capillaries leak blood into alveoli. Medium-vessel involvement causes pulmonary nodules that may cavitate. Large-vessel vasculitis (Takayasu, giant cell arteritis) can involve pulmonary arteries.",
      "key_insight": "The pulmonary-renal syndrome (DAH + glomerulonephritis) strongly suggests AAV or anti-GBM disease. In AAV, ANCA is pathogenic - antibodies activate neutrophils causing endothelial damage. GPA and MPA differ histologically (granulomas vs no granulomas) and by predominant ANCA specificity.",
      "technical_details": "GPA: cANCA (PR3) ~90%; MPA: pANCA (MPO) ~70%; EGPA: variable ANCA (MPO>PR3) ~40%. Biopsy shows necrotizing vasculitis with granulomas (GPA), pauci-immune capillaritis (MPA), or eosinophilic infiltration with granulomas (EGPA). Treatment follows RAVE trial: rituximab non-inferior to cyclophosphamide for induction."

  "clinical_features": {
    "pathophysiology": {
      "mechanism": "In AAV, ANCAs activate neutrophils primed by inflammatory cytokines. Activated neutrophils adhere to endothelium, release proteases and reactive oxygen species, causing vessel wall necrosis. In GPA, granulomatous inflammation additionally forms. In EGPA, eosinophilic infiltration and granulomas develop in the context of TH2 hyperactivity.",
      "key_pathways": [
        "ANCA binds surface PR3/MPO on primed neutrophils → neutrophil activation",
        "Activated neutrophils → degranulation → endothelial damage → necrotizing vasculitis",
        "Capillary destruction → blood extravasation into alveoli → DAH",

      ],
      "clinical_significance": "Untreated severe AAV has >80% mortality at 1 year, primarily from renal failure and DAH. With modern treatment, remission is achieved in 80-90% but relapse is common (50% at 5 years)."
