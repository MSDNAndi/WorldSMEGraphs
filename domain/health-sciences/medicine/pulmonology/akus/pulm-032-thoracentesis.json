    "statement": {
      "text": "Thoracentesis is a bedside procedure involving needle aspiration of pleural fluid through the chest wall. It serves both diagnostic purposes (determining the etiology of pleural effusion via fluid analysis) and therapeutic purposes (relieving dyspnea from large effusions). Ultrasound guidance significantly reduces complication rates and is now standard of care. Light's criteria, comparing pleural fluid to serum protein and LDH levels, differentiate transudative from exudative effusions and guide further workup.",
      "formal": "Light's Criteria (Exudate if ANY): Pleural protein/serum protein >0.5 | Pleural LDH/serum LDH >0.6 | Pleural LDH >2/3 upper limit normal serum LDH"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "When fluid accumulates between the lung and chest wall (pleural effusion), it can compress the lung and cause shortness of breath. Thoracentesis removes this fluid with a needle. By analyzing the fluid, we can determine why it accumulated - is it 'watery' fluid leaking from low protein states (heart failure, cirrhosis) or 'inflammatory' fluid from infection, cancer, or other diseases? This distinction guides treatment.",
      "key_insight": "Light's criteria are highly sensitive (98%) for identifying exudates but less specific (83%). Some transudates (especially with diuretic use) may be misclassified as exudates. When Light's criteria suggest exudate but clinical picture suggests transudate, check serum-effusion albumin gradient (>1.2 g/dL suggests transudate) or serum-effusion protein gradient (>3.1 g/dL suggests transudate).",
      "technical_details": "The procedure involves inserting a needle perpendicular to the chest wall, just above the rib (to avoid the neurovascular bundle running below each rib). The needle enters the pleural space and fluid is aspirated. For therapeutic thoracentesis, a catheter may be advanced to allow drainage. Maximum removal of 1-1.5L per session reduces re-expansion pulmonary edema risk."
