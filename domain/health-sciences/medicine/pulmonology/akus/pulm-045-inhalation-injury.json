    "title": "Inhalation Injury",
    "summary": "Inhalation injury encompasses thermal injury to the upper airway, chemical injury to the tracheobronchial tree and alveoli from inhaled toxins, and systemic toxicity from carbon monoxide and cyanide. It significantly increases mortality in burn patients and requires early recognition, airway protection, and supportive care.",
    "key_points": [
      "Thermal injury confined to supraglottic airway (heat dissipates rapidly); steam can injure lower airways",
      "Chemical injury from combustion products (aldehydes, acids, particulates) causes tracheobronchitis and ARDS",
      "Carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning: cherry-red color unreliable; treat with 100% O2 or hyperbaric oxygen",
      "Cyanide toxicity: metabolic acidosis with normal PaO2; treat with hydroxocobalamin",
      "Early intubation if clinical suspicion (facial burns, singed nasal hairs, carbonaceous sputum, stridor)",
      "Bronchoscopy confirms diagnosis; management is primarily supportive with aggressive pulmonary toilet"
    ],
    "statement": "Inhalation injury is a heterogeneous condition ranging from supraglottic thermal burns to systemic toxicity from inhaled gases. Early airway management and recognition of systemic poisoning are critical, as inhalation injury significantly increases mortality in burn patients.",
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "The upper airway is an effective heat exchanger, limiting thermal injury to supraglottic structures. However, steam and toxic chemicals in smoke bypass this protection. Combustion products cause direct epithelial damage, inflammation, and impaired mucociliary clearance. CO binds hemoglobin with 200× affinity of oxygen, and cyanide blocks mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase.",
      "key_insight": "The triad of facial burns, carbonaceous sputum, and enclosed-space fire exposure should prompt early intubation before airway edema progresses. CO-oximetry (not standard pulse oximetry) is required to detect carboxyhemoglobin, as SpO2 is falsely normal in CO poisoning.",
      "technical_details": "Diagnosis: flexible bronchoscopy showing erythema, edema, carbonaceous deposits, mucosal sloughing. CO poisoning: COHb >10% (smokers >15%) with symptoms. Cyanide: lactate >10 mmol/L with unexplained acidosis in fire victim. Treatment: 100% O2 until COHb <5%; hydroxocobalamin 5g IV for cyanide."

  "clinical_features": {
    "pathophysiology": {
      "mechanism": "Three distinct injury patterns: (1) Thermal injury to supraglottic structures causes edema that can progress to complete obstruction within 12-24 hours. (2) Chemical injury from inhaled irritants causes epithelial necrosis, inflammation, bronchorrhea, and impaired mucociliary clearance leading to atelectasis and pneumonia. (3) Systemic toxicity from CO (blocks O2 delivery) and cyanide (blocks O2 utilization) causes cellular hypoxia.",
      "key_pathways": [
        "Heat → upper airway burns → progressive edema → airway obstruction",
        "Toxic gases → epithelial injury → inflammation → bronchorrhea → atelectasis/pneumonia",
        "CO → COHb formation → decreased O2-carrying capacity → tissue hypoxia",
        "CN → cytochrome oxidase inhibition → blocked oxidative phosphorylation → lactic acidosis"
      ],
      "clinical_significance": "Inhalation injury increases mortality in burns by 20% and is the leading cause of death in fire victims. The combination of inhalation injury with cutaneous burns synergistically increases mortality."
