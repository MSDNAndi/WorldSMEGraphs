    "title": "Inhaler Technique",
    "summary": "Proper use of inhaled medication delivery devices including metered-dose inhalers (MDI), dry powder inhalers (DPI), and nebulizers for effective drug delivery to the respiratory tract",
    "key_points": ["Proper technique essential - poor technique is common cause of treatment failure", "MDI requires slow deep inspiration with breath-hold; spacer improves delivery", "DPI requires fast forceful inspiration - DO NOT use spacer with DPI", "Spacer recommended for MDI with ICS to reduce oropharyngeal deposition", "Nebulizer for patients unable to coordinate or generate adequate inspiratory flow", "Observe and correct technique at every visit - deteriorates over time", "Different devices require different techniques - don't assume competence"],
    "statement": {"text": "Effective inhaler technique is critical for drug delivery to the airways. Metered-dose inhalers (MDI) require slow, deep inspiration followed by breath-hold; using a spacer improves lung deposition and reduces oropharyngeal side effects. Dry powder inhalers (DPI) require fast, forceful inspiration to disperse the powder. Nebulizers deliver medication as a mist for patients unable to use handheld devices. Poor technique is a major cause of treatment failure in asthma and COPD.", "formal": "MDI technique = Shake | Exhale fully | Seal lips | Actuate while inhaling slowly (3-5 sec) | Hold breath 10 sec | DPI = Exhale away | Inhale fast and deep | Hold breath"},
    "explanation": {"intuition": "Inhaled medications work by depositing drug particles directly onto the airway surface. If particles are too large or the breathing pattern is wrong, drug deposits in the mouth and throat instead of the lungs. MDIs spray medicine with propellant - you need to inhale slowly so particles can travel deep into the lungs. DPIs use your breath to carry powder - you need to inhale fast and hard to pick up the medicine.", "key_insight": "The optimal breathing pattern is OPPOSITE for MDI vs DPI. MDI = slow and steady (3-5 seconds) to let propellant evaporate and particles decelerate. DPI = fast and forceful to generate enough turbulence to disperse powder. Teaching this difference is crucial when patients switch devices.", "technical_details": "Particle size determines deposition site. 1-5 μm particles reach lower airways; larger particles impact in oropharynx. Spacers allow propellant evaporation and particle deceleration, improving lung deposition from 10-20% to 20-40%. MDI-spacer delivery is equivalent to nebulizer for most patients with adequate technique."},

    "pathophysiology": {"mechanism": "Inhaled drugs must reach the target site (bronchial smooth muscle, inflammatory cells) to be effective.
