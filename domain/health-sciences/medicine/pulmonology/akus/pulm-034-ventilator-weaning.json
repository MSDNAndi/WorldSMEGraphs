    "title": "Ventilator Weaning and Liberation",
    "summary": "Ventilator weaning is the systematic process of discontinuing mechanical ventilation while monitoring for tolerance. Daily spontaneous breathing trials (SBT) with protocolized assessment have been shown to reduce ventilator days. Success depends on resolution of the underlying disease, adequate respiratory mechanics, and absence of new complications.",
    "key_points": [
      "Daily screening for readiness: resolving disease, adequate oxygenation (P/F ≥150), hemodynamically stable, awake",
      "Spontaneous breathing trial (SBT): 30-120 min on minimal support (PSV 5-8 or T-piece) assessing tolerance",
      "SBT failure signs: RR >35, SpO2 <90%, HR >140 or change >20%, SBP >180 or <90, agitation/distress",
      "Rapid shallow breathing index (RSBI): RR/VT in L; >105 predicts failure; <105 suggests success (PPV ~80%)",
      "Sedation vacation (awakening trial) paired with SBT improves outcomes (ABC bundle)",
      "Post-extubation stridor risk: cuff leak test; dexamethasone prophylaxis if at risk"
    ],
    "statement": "Liberation from mechanical ventilation should be considered daily once the underlying indication resolves. Protocolized spontaneous breathing trials with integrated awakening trials reduce duration of mechanical ventilation and ICU length of stay.",
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Prolonged mechanical ventilation leads to diaphragm atrophy (ventilator-induced diaphragmatic dysfunction), increased infection risk, and ICU-acquired weakness. Early and frequent assessment of readiness for liberation improves outcomes. The SBT tests the patient's ability to sustain adequate gas exchange and work of breathing independently.",
      "key_insight": "The rapid shallow breathing index (RSBI = RR/VT in liters) is the most validated weaning predictor, but no single parameter is sufficient. Integrating daily awakening trials with breathing trials (ABCs) reduces ventilator days by identifying patients ready for liberation who might otherwise remain oversedated.",
      "technical_details": "SBT options: T-piece (no ventilator support), CPAP 5, or PSV 5-8/PEEP 5. Duration 30-120 minutes. Extubation criteria: passed SBT, adequate cough (white card test), manageable secretions, patent upper airway. Cuff leak test: deflate cuff and occlude ETT - audible air leak suggests adequate laryngeal patency."

  "clinical_features": {
    "pathophysiology": {
      "mechanism": "Successful weaning requires: (1) Adequate respiratory drive (intact CNS, no oversedation), (2) Respiratory muscle strength (no critical illness myopathy, adequate nutrition), (3) Manageable respiratory load (resolved lung disease, no excessive secretions), (4) Cardiovascular reserve (no cardiac decompensation with increased work of breathing), (5) Psychological readiness (not agitated or delirious).",
      "key_pathways": [
        "Controlled ventilation → diaphragm disuse → atrophy (VIDD) within 18-48 hours",
        "Prolonged intubation → laryngeal edema → post-extubation stridor risk",
