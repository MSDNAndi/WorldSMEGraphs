    "title": "Lung Transplantation",
    "summary": "Lung transplantation is the definitive treatment for select patients with end-stage lung disease refractory to medical therapy. Common indications include COPD, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), cystic fibrosis, and pulmonary arterial hypertension. Careful candidate selection, lifelong immunosuppression, and vigilance for complications including chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD) are essential.",
    "key_points": [
      "Indications: end-stage COPD, IPF, cystic fibrosis, PAH unresponsive to medical therapy",
      "Bilateral lung transplant preferred for suppurative diseases (CF, bronchiectasis)",
      "Triple immunosuppression: tacrolimus + mycophenolate + prednisone",
      "Chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD) is leading cause of late mortality",
      "Median survival ~6 years post-transplant",
      "Contraindications: recent malignancy, active infection, non-compliance, significant comorbidities"
    ],
    "statement": "Lung transplantation offers survival and quality of life benefits for carefully selected patients with end-stage lung disease, but requires lifelong immunosuppression, vigilant monitoring, and management of complications including chronic lung allograft dysfunction.",
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Lung transplant is like getting new lungs when your own are failing and nothing else helps. It's a major decision because it trades one set of problems (end-stage lung disease) for another (immunosuppression complications, rejection). The transplanted lungs are exposed to the outside world with every breath, making rejection and infection constant concerns.",
      "key_insight": "The major long-term challenge is chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD), which affects ~50% of recipients by 5 years. CLAD presents as progressive airflow obstruction (BOS subtype) or restrictive changes (RAS subtype). There is no effective treatment once established, making early detection and prevention critical.",
      "technical_details": "Lung allocation is based on the Lung Allocation Score (LAS), which prioritizes patients based on expected survival benefit. Bridge to transplant with ECMO is increasingly used for decompensating patients. Ex vivo lung perfusion (EVLP) has expanded the donor pool by reconditioning marginal donor lungs."
