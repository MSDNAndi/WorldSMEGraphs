    "title": "Hypokalemia",
    "summary": "Hypokalemia (K+ <3.5 mEq/L) is very common, most often from GI losses (vomiting, diarrhea) or diuretics. It causes characteristic ECG changes (U waves, flattened T waves), muscle weakness, and can be life-threatening when severe. Coexisting hypomagnesemia must be corrected for potassium repletion to be effective.",
    "key_points": [
      "Common causes: GI losses (diarrhea, vomiting) and diuretics",
      "ECG changes: flattened T waves, U waves, ST depression, prolonged QT",
      "Refractory hypokalemia often indicates concurrent hypomagnesemia - check and replace Mg first",
      "Urine K+ >20 mEq/L indicates renal wasting; <20 mEq/L indicates extrarenal losses",
      "Oral replacement preferred; IV KCl at maximum 10-20 mEq/hr peripherally",
      "Potassium shifts into cells with alkalosis, insulin, beta-agonists",
      "Can cause ileus, rhabdomyolysis, and respiratory muscle weakness"
    ],
    "statement": "Hypokalemia results from decreased intake (rare alone), increased losses (GI or renal), or transcellular shift. The approach involves identifying the source of loss using clinical history and urine potassium, addressing underlying causes, and replacing potassium while monitoring for complications.",
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Potassium is critical for maintaining the resting membrane potential of muscles and nerves. When potassium is low, cells become hyperpolarized (more negative inside), making it harder to fire action potentials. This manifests as weakness, decreased reflexes, and cardiac conduction abnormalities. The heart is particularly sensitive because of its dependence on proper K+ gradients for repolarization.",
      "key_insight": "The urine potassium helps identify the source: if kidneys are working properly and the patient is hypokalemic, they should be conserving potassium (urine K+ <20 mEq/L). If urine K+ is high despite hypokalemia, there's a renal wasting problem (diuretics, hyperaldosteronism, RTA). Always check magnesium - it's required for potassium repletion to work.",
      "technical_details": "Potassium handling: 90% of K+ is reabsorbed in the proximal tubule and loop of Henle. Secretion in the collecting duct (via ROMK and BK channels) is regulated by aldosterone, distal delivery of Na+, urine flow rate, and plasma K+. Alkalosis causes K+/H+ shift; for every 0.1 increase in pH, K+ falls ~0.6 mEq/L. Magnesium is required for Na+/K+-ATPase function; without it, potassium replacement is ineffective."
