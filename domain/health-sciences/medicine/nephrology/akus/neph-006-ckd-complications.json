    "summary": "CKD complications arise from impaired kidney function and include anemia (reduced erythropoietin), CKD-mineral and bone disorder (CKD-MBD with hyperphosphatemia, hypocalcemia, secondary hyperparathyroidism), cardiovascular disease, hyperkalemia, metabolic acidosis, and uremic symptoms. Management is essential to slow progression and improve quality of life.",
    "key_points": [
      "Anemia: reduced erythropoietin; treat with ESAs when Hgb <10 g/dL; target Hgb 10-11.5",
      "CKD-MBD: hyperphosphatemia, low vitamin D, secondary hyperparathyroidism → renal osteodystrophy",
      "Cardiovascular disease: leading cause of death in CKD; accelerated atherosclerosis and LVH",
      "Hyperkalemia: dietary restriction, avoid NSAIDs/ACEi in severe CKD, patiromer/sodium zirconium cyclosilicate",

    "statement": "The complications of CKD are systemic and contribute significantly to morbidity and mortality. Proactive management of anemia, mineral-bone disorder, and cardiovascular risk factors is essential for optimal outcomes.",
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Healthy kidneys produce erythropoietin, activate vitamin D, excrete phosphorus, and regulate acid-base balance. As nephrons are lost, these functions decline: EPO deficiency causes anemia; phosphorus retention and vitamin D deficiency trigger secondary hyperparathyroidism; acid excretion failure causes metabolic acidosis; toxin accumulation causes uremia.",
      "key_insight": "CKD-MBD is a systemic disorder linking bone, mineral, and cardiovascular abnormalities. High FGF-23 early in CKD maintains phosphorus but inhibits vitamin D and contributes to LVH. Vascular calcification from hyperphosphatemia drives CV mortality.",
      "technical_details": "PTH targets: CKD 3-4 maintain near normal; CKD 5/dialysis 2-9× upper normal. Phosphorus target <5.5 mg/dL (dialysis). ESA targets: Hgb 10-11.5 g/dL (avoid >13); ensure iron replete (TSAT >20%, ferritin >100). Bicarbonate supplementation target HCO3 22-26 mEq/L."

  "clinical_features": {
    "pathophysiology": {
      "mechanism": "As GFR declines: (1) Phosphorus excretion falls → hyperphosphatemia, (2) 1,25-vitamin D synthesis decreases → hypocalcemia, (3) FGF-23 rises to maintain phosphorus but inhibits vitamin D, (4) PTH rises in response → secondary hyperparathyroidism, (5) EPO production falls → anemia, (6) Acid excretion decreases → metabolic acidosis, (7) Uremic toxins accumulate.",
      "key_pathways": [
        "↓ GFR → ↓ phosphorus excretion → ↑ FGF-23 → ↓ 1,25-vitamin D → ↓ calcium → ↑ PTH",

        "↓ acid excretion + ↓ ammonia synthesis → metabolic acidosis",
