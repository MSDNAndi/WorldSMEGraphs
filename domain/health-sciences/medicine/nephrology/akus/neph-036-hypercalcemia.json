      "text": "Hypercalcemia is defined as serum calcium above 10.5 mg/dL (corrected for albumin) or ionized calcium above 5.2 mg/dL. The two most common causes—primary hyperparathyroidism and malignancy—account for over 90% of cases. PTH measurement distinguishes them: elevated or inappropriately normal PTH indicates hyperparathyroidism, while suppressed PTH suggests malignancy or other non-PTH-mediated causes. Symptoms follow the mnemonic 'stones, bones, groans, moans, and psychiatric overtones' reflecting renal, skeletal, GI, neuromuscular, and CNS manifestations.",

    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Think of calcium as tightly regulated—the parathyroid glands monitor blood calcium continuously and adjust PTH secretion to keep levels stable. When calcium rises, PTH should suppress. If PTH is high despite high calcium, the parathyroid is 'broken' (adenoma or hyperplasia). If PTH is appropriately low but calcium is still high, something else is adding calcium (cancer, excessive vitamin D, etc.).",
      "key_insight": "The PTH level is the single most important test in hypercalcemia workup. It immediately categorizes the cause as PTH-mediated (hyperparathyroidism) or non-PTH-mediated (malignancy, vitamin D toxicity, etc.). Get this test first before ordering extensive workups.",
      "technical_details": "Calcium homeostasis: PTH increases bone resorption, renal calcium reabsorption, and 1,25(OH)2D synthesis. In primary hyperparathyroidism, autonomous PTH secretion overrides normal feedback. In malignancy, hypercalcemia occurs via: (1) PTHrP secretion (humoral hypercalcemia), (2) local osteolysis (bone metastases), (3) 1,25(OH)2D production (lymphoma). Correct total calcium: Corrected Ca = Measured Ca + 0.8 × (4 - albumin)."
