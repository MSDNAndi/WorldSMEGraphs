    "key_points": [
      "Uses peritoneal membrane as natural dialysis membrane with dextrose-based dialysate",
      "CAPD: Manual exchanges 4-5 times daily; APD: Cycler-assisted overnight exchanges",
      "Advantages: Home-based, preserves residual kidney function longer, no vascular access needed",
      "Peritonitis is major complication; diagnose with cloudy effluent and WBC >100/μL (>50% PMNs)",
      "PD catheter placed surgically or percutaneously; 2-week break-in period before use",
      "Adequacy measured by weekly Kt/V urea ≥1.7 (including residual function)",
      "Better for patients with preserved residual function, limited vascular access, or preference for independence"
    ],
    "statement": "Peritoneal dialysis is a home-based renal replacement therapy using the peritoneal membrane for solute and fluid exchange, offering lifestyle flexibility and preservation of residual kidney function.",
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "In peritoneal dialysis, the peritoneum (membrane lining the abdominal cavity) acts as the dialysis filter. Dialysate fluid is instilled into the abdomen, wastes diffuse from blood vessels in the peritoneum into the fluid, and excess water is drawn out by osmotic pull of dextrose. After dwelling, the fluid is drained and replaced.",
      "key_insight": "PD offers comparable survival to HD in the first 2-3 years (especially with residual kidney function) while providing lifestyle advantages. However, technique survival is limited by peritonitis episodes and progressive membrane failure. Patient selection and training are critical to success.",
      "technical_details": "Solute clearance occurs by diffusion across the peritoneal membrane (blood vessels → dialysate). Water removal (ultrafiltration) is driven by osmotic gradient from dextrose (1.5%, 2.5%, 4.25% solutions) or icodextrin (glucose polymer for long dwells). Transport characteristics vary by patient (high/fast transporters have better clearance but less ultrafiltration; low/slow transporters vice versa) - assessed by peritoneal equilibration test (PET)."
