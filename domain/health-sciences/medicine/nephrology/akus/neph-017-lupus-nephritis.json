    "statement": {
      "text": "Lupus nephritis is immune complex-mediated glomerulonephritis occurring in 30-60% of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus. The ISN/RPS classification system defines six histological classes based on renal biopsy findings. Class III (focal proliferative) and Class IV (diffuse proliferative) lupus nephritis carry the highest risk of progression and require aggressive immunosuppressive induction therapy followed by prolonged maintenance. Treatment decisions are guided by biopsy class, with mycophenolate mofetil and cyclophosphamide as first-line induction agents.",
      "formal": "Lupus Nephritis = SLE + Renal involvement (proteinuria, hematuria, ↓GFR) + Immune complex deposition on biopsy"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "In lupus, the immune system attacks the body's own tissues. The kidney is a common target because autoantibodies (especially anti-dsDNA) form immune complexes that deposit in the glomeruli, triggering inflammation. The biopsy tells us how much of the kidney is affected and how severely—this determines whether we need heavy-duty treatment or can be more conservative.",
      "key_insight": "Not all lupus nephritis is the same. Class I and II are mild and may need only monitoring. Class III and IV are proliferative and aggressive—without treatment, they progress to ESRD. Class V is membranous and can occur alone or with proliferative changes. Always get a biopsy to classify.",
      "technical_details": "Pathogenesis: Anti-dsDNA antibodies cross-react with glomerular antigens or form circulating immune complexes that deposit in mesangium and subendothelial/subepithelial spaces. Complement activation (C3, C4 consumption) and inflammatory cell recruitment cause glomerular injury. Histology shows 'full house' immunofluorescence (IgG, IgM, IgA, C3, C1q) and wire loop deposits in severe cases."
