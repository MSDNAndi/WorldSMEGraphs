    "statement": {
      "text": "Hypophosphatemia is defined as serum phosphorus below 2.5 mg/dL, with severe hypophosphatemia below 1.0 mg/dL. It occurs through three mechanisms: decreased intake or intestinal absorption, transcellular shift (insulin, refeeding, respiratory alkalosis), or increased renal excretion (hyperparathyroidism, Fanconi syndrome). Clinical manifestations reflect phosphorus's critical role in ATP synthesis and include muscle weakness, respiratory failure, cardiac dysfunction, and neurological symptoms.",
      "formal": "Hypophosphatemia = Serum PO4 <2.5 mg/dL = ↓Intake + ↓Absorption OR Transcellular shift OR ↑Renal losses"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Phosphorus is the 'P' in ATP—the energy currency of all cells. When phosphorus drops severely, cells cannot make enough ATP, and energy-dependent functions fail. Muscles weaken (including the diaphragm), the heart pumps poorly, and red blood cells become fragile. The classic scenario is refeeding a malnourished patient—insulin drives phosphorus into cells, causing sudden severe depletion.",
      "key_insight": "The timing and mechanism matter: acute hypophosphatemia (transcellular shift) causes symptoms at higher levels than chronic depletion because there's no time for compensation. Refeeding syndrome is dangerous precisely because it combines acute shift with underlying depletion in malnourished patients.",
      "technical_details": "Phosphorus exists as inorganic phosphate (measured in serum) and organic phosphate (ATP, 2,3-DPG, phospholipids). Serum levels represent <1% of total body phosphorus; most is in bone (85%) and intracellular (14%). Renal handling: freely filtered, 80-90% reabsorbed in proximal tubule via NaPi-IIa/c transporters regulated by PTH, FGF23, and dietary phosphorus."

    "pathophysiology": {
      "mechanism": "Phosphorus is essential for ATP synthesis, 2,3-DPG production (oxygen delivery), cell membrane integrity, and bone mineralization. Depletion impairs energy-dependent cellular processes. In muscles, ATP depletion causes weakness and rhabdomyolysis. In red blood cells, low 2,3-DPG increases hemoglobin-oxygen affinity, impairing oxygen delivery to tissues. Cardiac myocytes lose contractility, and neurological dysfunction occurs due to impaired neurotransmission.",
