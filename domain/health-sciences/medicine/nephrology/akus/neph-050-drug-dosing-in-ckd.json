    "statement": {
      "text": "Drug dosing in chronic kidney disease requires understanding how reduced GFR affects drug pharmacokinetics. Renally cleared drugs accumulate, increasing toxicity risk. Dosing adjustments involve reducing the dose (maintains peak levels, extends trough) or extending the interval (maintains peak-trough ratio). Protein binding changes increase free drug fraction, and volume of distribution may change. Dialysis clearance depends on drug properties—small, water-soluble, unbound drugs are removed efficiently and may need supplementation.",
      "formal": "Drug dose adjustment = f(GFR, renal clearance fraction, protein binding, Vd, dialyzability)"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Think of the kidney as a drain. When the drain slows down (low GFR), drugs that exit through it accumulate like water in a slow-draining sink. We either add less drug (lower dose) or add it less often (longer interval) to prevent overflow (toxicity). Some drugs escape through other drains (liver metabolism), so they don't need adjustment.",
      "key_insight": "Not all drugs need adjustment. The fraction of drug cleared by the kidney determines adjustment necessity. A drug 90% renally cleared needs significant adjustment in CKD, while a drug 10% renally cleared may not. Look up the renal clearance fraction (fe) for each medication.",
      "technical_details": "Key pharmacokinetic parameters affected: (1) Clearance—proportional to GFR for renally excreted drugs; (2) Protein binding—uremia decreases albumin binding, increasing free fraction; (3) Volume of distribution—altered by edema, muscle wasting; (4) Bioavailability—may change due to uremic gastroparesis. Dose adjustment: new dose = usual dose × (patient CrCl / normal CrCl) for drugs with 100% renal excretion."
