    "title": "Post-renal Acute Kidney Injury",
    "summary": "Post-renal AKI results from obstruction of urinary outflow, which must be bilateral (or affect a solitary functioning kidney) to cause significant renal dysfunction. It is the most readily reversible form of AKI when diagnosed and treated promptly through relief of obstruction.",
    "key_points": [
      "Requires bilateral obstruction or obstruction of a solitary kidney",
      "Renal ultrasound is initial diagnostic test - look for hydronephrosis",
      "Absence of hydronephrosis does not exclude obstruction (early, dehydrated, encased kidney)",
      "BPH is most common cause in elderly men",
      "Prompt relief of obstruction is definitive treatment",
      "Post-obstructive diuresis may occur after relief - monitor closely",
      "Urinary indices vary and are not reliable for diagnosis"
    ],
    "statement": "Post-renal acute kidney injury occurs when urinary outflow is obstructed, causing back-pressure that impairs glomerular filtration. Unlike other forms of AKI, it is uniquely amenable to mechanical intervention, and prompt relief of obstruction can lead to complete recovery if treated before permanent parenchymal damage occurs.",
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Think of post-renal AKI like a backed-up plumbing system - when the drain is blocked, pressure builds up backward until no new water can enter the system. In the kidney, obstruction causes the renal pelvis and calyces to dilate (hydronephrosis), and the back-pressure eventually opposes glomerular filtration.",
      "key_insight": "Post-renal AKI is the only form of AKI where the primary treatment is mechanical rather than medical. Ultrasound can rapidly diagnose hydronephrosis, and relief of obstruction (catheterization, stent, or nephrostomy) can be performed emergently. The key is to think of obstruction early in the differential.",
      "technical_details": "Acute obstruction initially increases intratubular pressure, which opposes glomerular filtration pressure and reduces GFR. This triggers afferent arteriolar vasoconstriction via tubuloglomerular feedback and angiotensin II. Prostaglandins and nitric oxide provide initial compensation. Prolonged obstruction leads to tubulointerstitial fibrosis and irreversible nephron loss. Complete obstruction causes more rapid damage than partial obstruction."
