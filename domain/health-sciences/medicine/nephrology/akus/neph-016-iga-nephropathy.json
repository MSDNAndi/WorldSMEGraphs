    "title": "IgA Nephropathy (Berger Disease)",
    "summary": "IgA nephropathy is the most common primary glomerulonephritis worldwide, characterized by mesangial IgA deposits. It classically presents with synpharyngitic hematuria (gross hematuria within 1-2 days of upper respiratory infection). Clinical course is highly variable, ranging from benign recurrent hematuria to progressive CKD requiring renal replacement therapy.",
    "key_points": [
      "Most common primary glomerulonephritis worldwide",
      "Synpharyngitic hematuria is classic presentation (within 24-48 hours of URI)",
      "Mesangial IgA deposits on immunofluorescence is diagnostic",
      "Oxford classification (MEST-C) predicts prognosis",
      "Variable prognosis: 20-40% progress to ESKD over 20 years",
      "RAAS blockade is cornerstone of treatment",
      "Consider immunosuppression for high-risk features"
    ],
    "statement": "IgA nephropathy represents a disorder of mucosal immunity where aberrantly glycosylated IgA1 forms immune complexes that deposit in the mesangium, triggering inflammation and progressive glomerular injury. Early recognition and treatment of modifiable risk factors can slow progression to end-stage kidney disease.",
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Think of IgA nephropathy as the kidney getting caught in the crossfire of an overactive mucosal immune response. IgA is normally our first-line defender in mucous membranes (respiratory, GI tract). In IgA nephropathy, abnormal IgA molecules clump together and get trapped in the kidney's filter, causing inflammation every time there's a mucosal infection.",
      "key_insight": "The hallmark 'synpharyngitic' timing distinguishes IgA nephropathy from post-infectious GN - in IgA nephropathy, hematuria occurs during or within 1-2 days of the infection, while post-streptococcal GN has a 1-3 week latent period. This reflects the pre-existing abnormal IgA that simply gets triggered by any mucosal infection.",
      "technical_details": "Galactose-deficient IgA1 (Gd-IgA1) is the key pathogenic molecule. It is produced by mucosal B cells and forms immune complexes with anti-glycan IgG antibodies. These complexes deposit in the mesangium, activate complement (alternative and lectin pathways), and stimulate mesangial cell proliferation and matrix expansion. Genetic factors (GWAS loci) and environmental triggers (mucosal infections) contribute to disease expression."
