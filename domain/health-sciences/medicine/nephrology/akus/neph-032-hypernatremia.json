  "content": {
    "title": "Hypernatremia",
    "summary": "Hypernatremia (Na >145 mEq/L) always reflects a water deficit relative to sodium, occurring when water intake cannot match water losses. It primarily affects those unable to access water (elderly, debilitated, intubated patients) and requires careful free water replacement with gradual correction to prevent cerebral edema.",
    "key_points": [
      "Always indicates hyperosmolality and free water deficit",
      "Usually occurs in patients with impaired thirst or water access (elderly, intubated, debilitated)",
      "Causes: inadequate water intake, excessive water loss (GI, renal, skin), rarely sodium excess",
      "Diabetes insipidus (central or nephrogenic) causes renal water loss",
      "Calculate free water deficit: 0.6 × weight × (Na/140 - 1)",
      "Correct slowly: maximum 10-12 mEq/L per 24 hours to prevent cerebral edema",
      "Acute (<48 hr): can correct faster; Chronic (>48 hr): correct slowly"
    ],
    "statement": "Hypernatremia represents a failure of water intake to match water losses. Unlike hyponatremia where water excess is common, hypernatremia indicates that intact thirst mechanisms are either not functioning or the patient cannot access water. Treatment focuses on restoring water balance while avoiding overcorrection.",
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Think of hypernatremia as 'too little water' rather than 'too much salt.' The serum sodium concentration is a ratio of sodium to water - when water is lost without proportional sodium loss, the concentration rises. This only happens when people can't drink enough water, either because they're unable to (intubated, demented) or their thirst is impaired (hypothalamic lesions, elderly).",
      "key_insight": "The brain adapts to chronic hypernatremia by accumulating organic osmolytes (taurine, glutamine, myo-inositol) to prevent shrinkage. If you correct sodium too quickly, these osmolytes draw water into brain cells causing cerebral edema - the opposite problem of osmotic demyelination in hyponatremia.",
      "technical_details": "Free water is regulated by ADH (vasopressin) and thirst. ADH is released in response to hyperosmolality or hypovolemia and acts on V2 receptors in the collecting duct to insert aquaporin-2 channels. In central DI, ADH is not produced; in nephrogenic DI, the kidney doesn't respond to ADH. The free water clearance formula (CH2O = V × (1 - Uosm/Posm)) quantifies renal water handling."
