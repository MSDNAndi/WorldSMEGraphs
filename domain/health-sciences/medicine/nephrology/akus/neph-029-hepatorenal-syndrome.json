    "title": "Hepatorenal Syndrome",
    "summary": "Hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) is a functional renal failure occurring in patients with advanced cirrhosis and portal hypertension, caused by severe renal vasoconstriction from splanchnic vasodilation. Diagnosed by exclusion of other AKI causes, HRS has poor prognosis without liver transplantation. Treatment focuses on vasoconstrictors (terlipressin, norepinephrine) plus albumin.",
    "key_points": [
      "Functional AKI in cirrhosis: kidneys are structurally normal; reversible with liver transplant",
      "Pathophysiology: splanchnic vasodilation → reduced effective arterial volume → renal vasoconstriction",
      "HRS-AKI (formerly Type 1): rapid GFR decline, poor prognosis without treatment",
      "HRS-NAKI (formerly Type 2): moderate stable renal dysfunction, often with refractory ascites",
      "Diagnosis of exclusion: no shock, no nephrotoxins, no parenchymal disease, no response to albumin challenge",
      "Treatment: terlipressin + albumin (or norepinephrine + albumin in ICU); liver transplant definitive"
    ],
    "statement": "HRS is a dreaded complication of decompensated cirrhosis with high mortality. Early recognition and treatment with vasoconstrictors plus albumin can reverse renal dysfunction and bridge to liver transplantation.",
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "In cirrhosis, portal hypertension causes splanchnic vasodilation (via NO and other vasodilators). This 'steals' blood from the systemic circulation, reducing effective arterial volume. The kidneys respond by intense vasoconstriction to maintain perfusion pressure, but this reduces renal blood flow and GFR. The kidneys are structurally normal - HRS reverses with liver transplant.",
      "key_insight": "HRS is a diagnosis of exclusion. Before diagnosing HRS, rule out hypovolemia (give albumin challenge 1g/kg), nephrotoxins (NSAIDs, aminoglycosides, contrast), and intrinsic renal disease (bland sediment, normal ultrasound). The key is recognizing HRS early when vasoconstrictor therapy can be effective.",
      "technical_details": "New ICA criteria (2019): cirrhosis + ascites + AKI stage 2-3 (or AKI stage 1 meeting HRS criteria) + no response to 2-day albumin 1g/kg + no shock + no nephrotoxins + no parenchymal disease. Terlipressin: 1mg IV q4-6h, titrate to max 2mg q4h; give with albumin 20-40g/day."

  "clinical_features": {
    "pathophysiology": {
      "mechanism": "Portal hypertension causes splanchnic arterial vasodilation via nitric oxide and other vasodilators. This reduces effective arterial blood volume, triggering compensatory activation of RAAS, sympathetic nervous system, and ADH. Intense renal vasoconstriction reduces GFR while sodium and water are avidly retained. The kidneys themselves are normal - HRS reverses after liver transplant.",
      "key_pathways": [
        "Cirrhosis → portal hypertension → splanchnic vasodilation (NO, prostaglandins)",
        "Splanchnic pooling → ↓ effective arterial volume → arterial underfilling",
        "Compensatory activation: RAAS, SNS, ADH → sodium/water retention",
        "Renal vasoconstriction → ↓ GFR → HRS"
      ],
      "clinical_significance": "Untreated HRS-AKI has median survival of weeks. Terlipressin + albumin reverses HRS in 40-50%, improving transplant-free survival. Liver transplant is curative - kidneys recover even after prolonged dialysis."
