    "title": "Hypocalcemia",
    "summary": "Hypocalcemia is low serum calcium (corrected <8.5 mg/dL or ionized <4.5 mg/dL), commonly caused by hypoparathyroidism, vitamin D deficiency, or chronic kidney disease. It presents with neuromuscular irritability (tetany, paresthesias, Chvostek/Trousseau signs) and cardiac effects (prolonged QT). Severe symptomatic hypocalcemia requires IV calcium.",
    "key_points": [
      "Always correct total calcium for albumin: add 0.8 mg/dL for each 1 g/dL albumin below 4",
      "Ionized calcium is the physiologically active form and gold standard",
      "Common causes: hypoparathyroidism, vitamin D deficiency, CKD, hypomagnesemia",
      "Chvostek sign: facial twitch with tapping; Trousseau sign: carpal spasm with BP cuff",
      "ECG: prolonged QT interval (risk of torsades de pointes)",
      "IV calcium gluconate for severe/symptomatic; oral calcium + vitamin D for chronic",
      "Must correct hypomagnesemia for calcium replacement to be effective"
    ],
    "statement": "Hypocalcemia results from decreased PTH, vitamin D deficiency, tissue deposition, or chelation of calcium. Clinical manifestations reflect increased neuromuscular excitability due to lowered threshold for action potential generation. Treatment targets both symptom relief and correction of the underlying cause.",
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Calcium acts as a 'stabilizer' of nerve and muscle cell membranes. When calcium is low, the threshold for nerve firing drops, making neurons and muscles hyperexcitable. This is why patients get tingling, muscle spasms, and even seizures - the cells are too 'trigger-happy' and fire too easily.",
      "key_insight": "The PTH-vitamin D axis is central to understanding hypocalcemia. PTH mobilizes calcium from bone, increases renal reabsorption, and stimulates vitamin D activation. Vitamin D enhances intestinal calcium absorption. Disruption anywhere in this axis (parathyroid surgery, vitamin D deficiency, CKD) causes hypocalcemia.",
      "technical_details": "Calcium exists in three forms: ionized (50%, physiologically active), albumin-bound (40%), and complexed to anions (10%). pH affects binding - alkalosis increases albumin binding, reducing ionized calcium (explaining post-hyperventilation tetany). PTH acts on bone (osteoclast activation) and kidney (calcium reabsorption, phosphate excretion, 1-alpha-hydroxylase activation). Active vitamin D (1,25-dihydroxy) primarily increases intestinal calcium absorption."
