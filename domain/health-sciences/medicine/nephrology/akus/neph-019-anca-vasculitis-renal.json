    "title": "ANCA-Associated Vasculitis - Renal Manifestations",
    "summary": "ANCA-associated vasculitis (AAV) represents a group of small-vessel vasculitides (GPA, MPA, EGPA) that commonly cause pauci-immune crescentic glomerulonephritis. Renal involvement is characterized by rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis (RPGN), requiring urgent diagnosis and immunosuppressive therapy to preserve kidney function.",
    "key_points": [
      "Three AAV types: GPA (c-ANCA/PR3), MPA (p-ANCA/MPO), EGPA (p-ANCA with eosinophilia)",
      "Pauci-immune GN: Crescentic GN with absent/minimal immune deposits on IF",
      "RPGN presentation: AKI, hematuria, proteinuria, RBC casts over days to weeks",
      "Pulmonary-renal syndrome: Concurrent diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH) is emergency",
      "Treatment: Rituximab or cyclophosphamide + glucocorticoids for induction",
      "Plasmapheresis for severe renal disease (creatinine >5.7) or DAH"
    ],
    "statement": "ANCA-associated vasculitis causes pauci-immune crescentic glomerulonephritis manifesting as rapidly progressive renal failure, requiring prompt recognition and aggressive immunosuppression to prevent irreversible kidney damage.",
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Think of ANCA as 'friendly fire' - antibodies that mistakenly target neutrophils, causing them to attack small blood vessels including glomerular capillaries. The resulting inflammation destroys the glomerulus rapidly, forming crescents (like the moon shape) of proliferating cells that obliterate the filtering space.",
      "key_insight": "The 'pauci-immune' nature is key: unlike other glomerulonephritides with prominent immune deposits, AAV shows minimal deposits because the damage is from activated neutrophils rather than immune complex deposition. ANCA testing plus biopsy showing crescentic GN with absent IF staining clinches the diagnosis.",
      "technical_details": "PR3-ANCA (c-ANCA pattern) is associated with GPA; MPO-ANCA (p-ANCA pattern) with MPA and EGPA. ANCA activate primed neutrophils to release toxic contents and adhere to endothelium. Biopsy shows segmental fibrinoid necrosis, cellular/fibrocellular crescents, and negative or 'pauci' (<2+) immunofluorescence."
