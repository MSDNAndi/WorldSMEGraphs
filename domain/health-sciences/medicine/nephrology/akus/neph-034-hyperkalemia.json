    "summary": "Hyperkalemia is serum potassium >5.5 mEq/L, a potentially fatal condition requiring urgent evaluation and treatment. Management follows a three-step approach: (1) stabilize the cardiac membrane with calcium, (2) shift potassium intracellularly with insulin/glucose and beta-agonists, and (3) remove potassium from the body through diuretics, cation exchangers, or dialysis.",
    "key_points": [
      "ECG changes correlate with cardiac toxicity: peaked T waves → wide QRS → sine wave → VF/asystole",
      "Calcium gluconate stabilizes cardiac membrane but does NOT lower potassium",
      "Insulin + glucose and beta-agonists shift K+ intracellularly (temporary)",
      "Diuretics, sodium polystyrene sulfonate (Kayexalate), patiromer remove K+ from body",
      "Dialysis is definitive treatment for severe hyperkalemia with renal failure",
      "Rule out pseudohyperkalemia (hemolysis, tourniquet, thrombocytosis, leukocytosis)",
      "Common causes: renal failure, medications (ACEi, ARBs, K-sparing diuretics), tissue breakdown"
    ],
    "statement": "Hyperkalemia is a medical emergency because elevated extracellular potassium affects cardiac conduction and can cause lethal arrhythmias. The treatment paradigm addresses immediate cardiac stabilization, temporizing measures to shift potassium into cells, and definitive measures to eliminate potassium from the body.",
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Potassium determines the resting membrane potential of cardiac cells. When extracellular potassium rises, the resting potential becomes less negative (depolarized), making it harder for cells to generate action potentials properly. This leads to progressive conduction abnormalities - first affecting repolarization (peaked T waves), then depolarization (wide QRS), and ultimately cardiac standstill.",
      "key_insight": "Treatment works in three phases: (1) Calcium raises the threshold potential, moving it further from the resting potential and restoring the ability to conduct normally - this buys time but doesn't change K+ level. (2) Insulin and beta-agonists shift K+ into cells - temporary effect lasting 2-6 hours. (3) Only GI binders, diuretics, or dialysis actually remove K+ from the body.",
      "technical_details": "Potassium is the major intracellular cation (150 mEq/L inside vs 4 mEq/L outside), creating a steep gradient maintained by Na+/K+-ATPase. Small changes in extracellular K+ significantly affect the Nernst potential. Insulin activates Na+/K+-ATPase, driving K+ into cells. Aldosterone stimulates renal K+ excretion via ENaC and ROMK channels in the collecting duct. Acidosis causes K+ to shift out of cells (K+/H+ exchange)."
