    "title": "Minimal Change Disease",
    "summary": "Minimal change disease (MCD) is the most common cause of nephrotic syndrome in children and a significant cause in adults. It is characterized by normal light microscopy, negative immunofluorescence, and diffuse podocyte foot process effacement on electron microscopy. MCD is highly responsive to corticosteroids with excellent long-term prognosis.",
    "key_points": [
      "Most common cause of nephrotic syndrome in children (70-90%)",
      "Normal light microscopy - hence 'minimal change'",
      "Electron microscopy: Diffuse podocyte foot process effacement",
      "Immunofluorescence: Negative (no immune deposits)",
      "Excellent response to corticosteroids (90% remission)",
      "Relapse common (50-75%) but does not progress to CKD"
    ],
    "statement": "Minimal change disease is a podocytopathy causing heavy proteinuria with normal light microscopy findings, highly responsive to steroids, representing the most common nephrotic syndrome etiology in children.",
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Think of podocytes as the velcro-like fasteners between the kidney's filtration membrane. In MCD, something (possibly T-cell derived factors) causes these fasteners to flatten out and lose their grip, allowing proteins to leak through. The damage is so subtle it's invisible under regular microscopy - you need the electron microscope to see the flattened 'feet.'",
      "key_insight": "MCD is a 'diagnosis of exclusion on biopsy' - the pathognomonic finding is seeing NOTHING abnormal on light microscopy and IF while seeing diffuse foot process effacement on EM. The 90% steroid response rate makes empiric treatment reasonable in children without biopsy, but adults typically undergo biopsy to exclude FSGS.",
      "technical_details": "The pathogenic 'permeability factor' remains elusive but appears to be T-cell derived. Circulating factors increase glomerular permeability to albumin by disrupting podocyte slit diaphragms (nephrin, podocin). Secondary causes include NSAIDs, lithium, Hodgkin lymphoma, and allergic reactions."
