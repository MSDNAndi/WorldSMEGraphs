    "title": "Intrinsic Acute Kidney Injury",
    "summary": "Intrinsic AKI results from direct damage to kidney parenchyma, most commonly affecting the tubules (ATN) but also including glomerular, interstitial, and vascular etiologies. Unlike pre-renal AKI, tubular function is impaired, leading to characteristic urinary findings and typically slower recovery.",
    "key_points": [
      "ATN (acute tubular necrosis) is the most common form of intrinsic AKI",
      "Muddy brown granular casts are pathognomonic for ATN",
      "FENa >2% indicates impaired tubular sodium reabsorption",
      "Urine osmolality approaches plasma (~300-350 mOsm/kg) - isosthenuric",
      "Ischemic and nephrotoxic ATN are the two main subtypes",
      "Recovery takes 1-3 weeks with supportive care",
      "No specific therapy; avoid further nephrotoxic insults"
    ],
    "statement": "Intrinsic acute kidney injury represents structural damage to the kidney parenchyma, most commonly manifesting as acute tubular necrosis from ischemia or nephrotoxins. Loss of tubular function results in impaired sodium reabsorption and urine concentrating ability, producing characteristic laboratory findings that distinguish it from pre-renal AKI.",
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Think of intrinsic AKI as the kidney suffering actual 'damage' rather than just 'stress.' When tubular cells die or become dysfunctional, they can no longer reabsorb sodium or concentrate urine properly. The dead cells slough off and form the characteristic muddy brown casts seen in urine microscopy.",
      "key_insight": "The hallmark of intrinsic AKI is loss of tubular function - the kidney cannot concentrate urine or reabsorb sodium even when volume depleted. This distinguishes it from pre-renal AKI where tubular function is preserved. Urinary indices reflect this impaired tubular function (FENa >2%, dilute urine).",
      "technical_details": "In ischemic ATN, prolonged hypoperfusion leads to ATP depletion in tubular epithelial cells, causing loss of cell polarity, tight junction disruption, and cell death. Nephrotoxic ATN occurs from direct toxicity to tubular cells. The S3 segment of the proximal tubule and medullary thick ascending limb are most vulnerable due to high metabolic activity and relative hypoxia. Recovery requires tubular cell regeneration from surviving cells."
