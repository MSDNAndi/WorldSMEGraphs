    "summary": "Continuous extracorporeal blood purification therapy used for hemodynamically unstable patients with acute kidney injury in the ICU, providing slow, continuous solute and fluid removal over 24 hours",
    "key_points": [
      "Preferred over intermittent hemodialysis in hemodynamically unstable patients",
      "Three main modalities: CVVH (hemofiltration), CVVHD (hemodialysis), CVVHDF (hemodiafiltration)",
      "Requires continuous anticoagulation (citrate or heparin)",
      "Blood flow rates typically 150-250 mL/min",
      "Effluent dose target 20-25 mL/kg/hr",
      "Better hemodynamic stability due to slow fluid removal",
      "Allows for aggressive nutrition and medication dosing"
    ],
    "statement": {
      "text": "Continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) encompasses extracorporeal techniques that provide 24-hour blood purification for critically ill patients with AKI. Unlike intermittent hemodialysis, CRRT removes fluid and solutes gradually, maintaining hemodynamic stability. The three modalities differ in clearance mechanism: CVVH uses convection, CVVHD uses diffusion, and CVVHDF combines both for optimal middle molecule and small solute clearance.",
      "formal": "CRRT = Continuous (24h) + Extracorporeal + (CVVH|CVVHD|CVVHDF) + Hemodynamically unstable AKI"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Think of CRRT as 'dialysis on slow motion.' Regular dialysis clears waste rapidly over 3-4 hours, causing blood pressure to drop. CRRT does the same job but spreads it over 24 hours, like slowly draining a bathtub versus pulling the plug suddenly. This gentle approach keeps critically ill patients stable.",
      "key_insight": "The key differentiating feature of CRRT modalities is the solute clearance mechanism: CVVH uses convection (solutes dragged along with water), CVVHD uses diffusion (solutes move down concentration gradient), and CVVHDF combines both. Convection is better for larger 'middle molecules' like inflammatory mediators, while diffusion excels at small solute clearance.",
      "technical_details": "Blood access via large-bore dual-lumen catheter (internal jugular or femoral). Blood pump creates transmembrane pressure gradient. Replacement fluid added pre-filter (dilutes blood, protects filter) or post-filter (more efficient clearance). Regional citrate anticoagulation preferred—chelates calcium in circuit, reversed with calcium infusion returning to patient, avoiding systemic anticoagulation."

  "clinical_features": {
    "pathophysiology": {
      "mechanism": "CRRT mimics native kidney function through continuous solute and fluid removal. Blood is pumped through a semipermeable hemofilter where waste products are cleared. In CVVH, a pressure gradient forces plasma water and dissolved solutes across the membrane (convection); lost volume is replaced with sterile crystalloid. In CVVHD, dialysate flows countercurrent to blood, allowing solute diffusion down concentration gradients. CVVHDF combines both mechanisms for enhanced clearance of small and middle molecules.",

        "Convection: Solutes move with water (solvent drag)—effective for middle molecules (β2-microglobulin, cytokines)",
