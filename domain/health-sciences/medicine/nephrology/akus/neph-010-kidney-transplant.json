    "title": "Kidney Transplant",
    "summary": "Kidney transplantation is the preferred renal replacement therapy for eligible patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), offering superior survival and quality of life compared to dialysis. Success depends on careful recipient selection, donor matching, surgical technique, and lifelong immunosuppression to prevent rejection.",
    "key_points": [
      "Living donor transplants have superior graft survival (95% at 5 years) vs deceased donor (85%)",
      "Triple immunosuppression: calcineurin inhibitor + antimetabolite + corticosteroids",
      "Hyperacute rejection: within minutes (preformed antibodies); prevent with crossmatch",
      "Acute cellular rejection: T-cell mediated, treat with pulse steroids or ATG",
      "Antibody-mediated rejection: DSA + C4d deposition; treat with plasmapheresis + IVIG",
      "BK virus nephropathy: major cause of graft loss; reduce immunosuppression"
    ],
    "statement": "Kidney transplantation represents the optimal treatment for ESRD, requiring meticulous donor-recipient matching, perioperative management, and lifelong immunosuppression with vigilant monitoring for rejection and complications.",
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Think of kidney transplant as adopting a vital organ that needs protection from the immune system. The recipient's body sees the new kidney as foreign and tries to reject it, so we use immunosuppressive medications as 'peacekeepers' to prevent the immune attack while balancing infection and malignancy risks.",
      "key_insight": "The key to transplant success is the balance between adequate immunosuppression to prevent rejection and minimizing immunosuppression to avoid infections and malignancies. Living donors provide better outcomes due to shorter cold ischemia time and optimal timing.",
      "technical_details": "HLA matching at A, B, DR loci determines compatibility. Panel-reactive antibodies (PRA) measure sensitization. Induction therapy (basiliximab or ATG) provides intense early immunosuppression. Maintenance regimens typically include tacrolimus (target 8-10 ng/mL early, 5-8 later), mycophenolate, and prednisone."
