    "title": "Respiratory Alkalosis",
    "summary": "Respiratory alkalosis is a primary acid-base disorder characterized by decreased arterial PCO2 (hypocapnia) due to alveolar hyperventilation, resulting in elevated blood pH. It is the most common acid-base abnormality in critically ill patients and can be caused by hypoxia, CNS disorders, pulmonary disease, or anxiety.",
    "key_points": [
      "Primary disturbance: Decreased PCO2 (<35 mmHg) from hyperventilation",
      "pH elevated (>7.45) unless mixed disorder or compensation",
      "Acute: HCO3 decreases 2 mEq/L per 10 mmHg drop in PCO2",
      "Chronic: HCO3 decreases 5 mEq/L per 10 mmHg drop in PCO2 (renal compensation)",
      "Life-threatening causes: PE, sepsis, salicylate toxicity, hepatic encephalopathy",
      "Symptoms: Lightheadedness, paresthesias, tetany (from decreased ionized Ca2+)"
    ],
    "statement": "Respiratory alkalosis results from alveolar hyperventilation causing hypocapnia, with severity and compensation distinguishing acute from chronic forms, requiring identification and treatment of the underlying cause.",
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Think of CO2 as an acid source - when you hyperventilate and 'blow off' CO2, you're removing acid from the blood. It's like opening a window to let steam out of a hot room - the atmosphere cools. In this case, removing CO2 makes the blood more alkaline.",
      "key_insight": "Respiratory alkalosis is often a sign of serious underlying disease rather than a primary problem. While anxiety hyperventilation is benign, the same ABG pattern in a sick patient may indicate PE, sepsis, or salicylate poisoning - conditions where hyperventilation is a compensatory response.",
      "technical_details": "CO2 + H2O ⇌ H2CO3 ⇌ H+ + HCO3-. Reducing PCO2 shifts equilibrium left, consuming H+, raising pH. Acute compensation occurs within minutes via cellular buffering. Chronic renal compensation takes 2-5 days: kidneys excrete HCO3 to normalize pH."
