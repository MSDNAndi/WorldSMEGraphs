    "title": "Rhabdomyolysis and Myoglobinuric Acute Kidney Injury",
    "summary": "Rhabdomyolysis is skeletal muscle breakdown releasing myoglobin, creatine kinase, and other intracellular contents. Myoglobin is nephrotoxic, causing AKI through tubular obstruction, direct tubular toxicity, and renal vasoconstriction. Early recognition and aggressive fluid resuscitation are critical for prevention of AKI and other complications.",
    "key_points": [
      "Creatine kinase (CK) >5× ULN (typically >10,000 U/L) is diagnostic",
      "Myoglobin causes AKI through obstruction, direct toxicity, and vasoconstriction",
      "Dark brown urine (cola-colored) with positive blood on dipstick but few RBCs on microscopy",
      "Life-threatening complications: hyperkalemia, hypocalcemia, DIC, compartment syndrome",
      "Aggressive IV crystalloid (200-300 mL/hr) is cornerstone of treatment",
      "Target urine output 200-300 mL/hr",
      "Bicarbonate therapy controversial; may help if urine pH <6.5"
    ],
    "statement": "Rhabdomyolysis represents a medical emergency where rapid skeletal muscle breakdown releases potentially lethal amounts of intracellular contents. The kidney is particularly vulnerable to myoglobin-induced injury, but early aggressive fluid resuscitation can prevent AKI and dramatically improve outcomes.",
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Think of rhabdomyolysis as a 'flood' of muscle contents into the bloodstream. Myoglobin is normally contained within muscle cells, but when released in large quantities, it overwhelms the kidney's ability to handle it. Myoglobin precipitates in the tubules (especially in acidic, concentrated urine), directly damages tubular cells, and causes renal blood vessel constriction - a triple hit to the kidney.",
      "key_insight": "The key to preventing AKI is early and aggressive volume expansion. By diluting the myoglobin and increasing urine flow, you reduce tubular obstruction and wash out the toxic pigment before it can cause irreversible damage. Alkalinization of urine may help prevent myoglobin precipitation, though evidence is limited.",
      "technical_details": "Myoglobin (17 kDa) is freely filtered by the glomerulus. In the tubule, it is taken up by proximal tubular cells where the heme moiety generates reactive oxygen species through Fenton reactions. Myoglobin also causes cast formation (especially with Tamm-Horsfall protein in acidic urine) and vasoconstriction via nitric oxide scavenging. Volume depletion potentiates all these mechanisms by concentrating myoglobin and reducing tubular flow."
