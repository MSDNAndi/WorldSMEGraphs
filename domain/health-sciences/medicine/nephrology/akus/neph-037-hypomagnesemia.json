    "summary": "Hypomagnesemia (Mg <1.8 mg/dL) is common, often underdiagnosed, and critically important because it causes refractory hypokalemia and hypocalcemia. Common causes include alcoholism, diuretics, GI losses, and medications (PPIs, aminoglycosides). Treatment requires both magnesium replacement and addressing the underlying cause.",
    "key_points": [
      "Causes refractory hypokalemia - must correct Mg for K repletion to work",
      "Causes refractory hypocalcemia - inhibits PTH secretion and action",
      "Common causes: alcoholism, diuretics, diarrhea, PPIs, aminoglycosides",
      "Clinical features similar to hypocalcemia: tremor, tetany, seizures, arrhythmias",
      "ECG: prolonged QT, torsades de pointes, widened QRS",
      "IV magnesium sulfate for severe/symptomatic; oral for mild/chronic",
      "Serum Mg poorly reflects total body stores - can be low even with normal serum level"
    ],
    "statement": "Hypomagnesemia is one of the most clinically important electrolyte disorders because of its effects on potassium and calcium homeostasis. Any patient with refractory hypokalemia or hypocalcemia should have magnesium checked and repleted, as other electrolyte abnormalities will not correct until magnesium is normalized.",
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Magnesium is the 'behind-the-scenes' electrolyte that makes everything else work properly. It's required for the Na+/K+-ATPase pump (so cells can hold onto potassium) and for PTH secretion and action (so the body can maintain calcium). When magnesium is low, these systems fail, and no amount of potassium or calcium supplementation will work until magnesium is replaced.",
      "key_insight": "Think of magnesium as the 'master key' for other electrolytes. When you see hypokalemia that won't correct despite replacement, or hypocalcemia with 'normal' PTH that should be elevated, always check magnesium. Replacing it often 'unlocks' the ability to correct the other abnormalities.",
      "technical_details": "Magnesium is required for: (1) Na+/K+-ATPase activity - low Mg causes K+ to leak out of cells; (2) ROMK channel function - low Mg causes renal K+ wasting; (3) PTH secretion - severely low Mg inhibits PTH release; (4) PTH action - low Mg causes end-organ PTH resistance. Magnesium also stabilizes ion channels and is a cofactor for hundreds of enzymatic reactions."
