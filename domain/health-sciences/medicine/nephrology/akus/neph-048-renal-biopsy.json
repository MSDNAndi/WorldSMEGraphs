    "title": "Renal Biopsy",
    "summary": "Renal biopsy is the gold standard for diagnosing glomerular diseases, unexplained AKI, proteinuria, and transplant dysfunction. Performed percutaneously under ultrasound guidance, it provides tissue for light microscopy, immunofluorescence, and electron microscopy. Complications include bleeding (most common), but serious events are rare with proper patient selection.",
    "key_points": [
      "Indications: unexplained AKI, glomerulonephritis, nephrotic syndrome, proteinuria >1g/day, transplant dysfunction",
      "Contraindications: uncontrolled HTN, bleeding diathesis, solitary kidney (relative), uncooperative patient",
      "Technique: ultrasound-guided percutaneous; lower pole of left kidney; 2-3 cores obtained",
      "Processing: light microscopy (LM), immunofluorescence (IF), electron microscopy (EM)",
      "Complications: gross hematuria (5-7%), perinephric hematoma, need for transfusion (<1%), nephrectomy (rare)",
      "Post-procedure: bed rest 4-6 hours, serial vitals, Hgb monitoring"
    ],
    "statement": "Renal biopsy remains essential for diagnosing and guiding treatment of glomerular diseases. Proper patient selection and technique minimize complications, making it a safe and informative procedure.",
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Many kidney diseases have similar clinical presentations (proteinuria, hematuria, AKI) but different underlying pathology requiring different treatments. Biopsy reveals the histologic pattern, immune deposits, and ultrastructural changes that distinguish diagnoses and guide therapy.",
      "key_insight": "A complete renal biopsy requires all three microscopy modalities: LM for general structure, IF for immune deposits (IgG, IgA, IgM, C3, C4, C1q, kappa, lambda), and EM for basement membrane abnormalities and electron-dense deposits. Missing any modality limits diagnostic accuracy.",
      "technical_details": "Adequate sample: ≥10 glomeruli for native kidney, ≥7 for transplant. Pre-procedure: hold anticoagulation, check BP (goal <150/90), platelet count >50,000, INR <1.5, bleeding time. Use 16-18 gauge automated needle. Target lower pole to avoid major vessels."
