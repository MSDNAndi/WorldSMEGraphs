    "title": "Pre-renal Acute Kidney Injury",
    "summary": "Pre-renal AKI is the most common form of acute kidney injury, caused by decreased renal perfusion from hypovolemia, reduced cardiac output, or systemic vasodilation. It is characterized by preserved tubular function and is typically reversible with restoration of adequate renal blood flow.",
    "key_points": [
      "BUN/Cr ratio >20:1 due to enhanced urea reabsorption",
      "FENa <1% indicates intact tubular sodium reabsorption",
      "FEUrea <35% more reliable in patients on diuretics",
      "Urine osmolality >500 mOsm/kg indicates concentrated urine",
      "Low urine sodium (<20 mEq/L) reflects avid sodium retention",
      "Reversible with volume repletion or hemodynamic optimization",
      "Bland urine sediment without casts or cells"
    ],
    "statement": "Pre-renal acute kidney injury represents a functional response to inadequate renal perfusion, where the kidney parenchyma remains intact but glomerular filtration is reduced due to hemodynamic factors. Early recognition and treatment can prevent progression to intrinsic kidney injury.",
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Think of pre-renal AKI as the kidney 'going into power-saving mode' - when blood flow decreases, the kidney conserves sodium and water to maintain blood pressure, resulting in concentrated urine with low sodium content. The kidney itself is healthy and working properly; it just isn't receiving enough blood.",
      "key_insight": "The hallmark of pre-renal AKI is preserved tubular function - the kidney appropriately responds to hypoperfusion by maximally reabsorbing sodium and concentrating urine. This distinguishes it from intrinsic AKI where tubular damage impairs these functions.",
      "technical_details": "Reduced renal blood flow activates the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) and sympathetic nervous system. Angiotensin II preferentially constricts the efferent arteriole to maintain GFR, while aldosterone increases sodium reabsorption. Prostaglandins and nitric oxide provide compensatory afferent arteriolar vasodilation. NSAIDs and ACE inhibitors can precipitate pre-renal AKI by blocking these compensatory mechanisms."
