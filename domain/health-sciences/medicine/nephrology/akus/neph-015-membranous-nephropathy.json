    "title": "Membranous Nephropathy",
    "summary": "Membranous nephropathy (MN) is a leading cause of nephrotic syndrome in adults, characterized by subepithelial immune complex deposits along the glomerular basement membrane. Primary MN is driven by autoantibodies to podocyte antigens (PLA2R in ~70%, THSD7A in ~3%), while secondary causes include malignancy, lupus, hepatitis B, and drugs. Treatment is guided by PLA2R status and risk stratification.",

      "Most common cause of nephrotic syndrome in white adults",
      "Subepithelial spike-and-dome deposits on electron microscopy",
      "Anti-PLA2R antibodies positive in ~70% of primary MN cases",
      "High spontaneous remission rate (30-40%) justifies initial observation in low-risk patients",
      "Rituximab is first-line immunosuppression for high-risk patients",
      "Screen for secondary causes: malignancy, lupus, HBV, drugs"
    ],
    "statement": "Membranous nephropathy is an autoimmune glomerular disease causing nephrotic syndrome through subepithelial immune complex deposition, diagnosed by biopsy showing basement membrane thickening and spike formation, with anti-PLA2R antibodies serving as a diagnostic and prognostic biomarker.",
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Imagine the glomerular basement membrane as a sieve. In MN, immune complexes deposit on the outside (subepithelial), creating bumps that interfere with filtration. The basement membrane tries to engulf these deposits, creating the characteristic 'spikes' seen on silver stain.",
      "key_insight": "PLA2R antibodies revolutionized MN diagnosis and monitoring: high titers at presentation predict worse outcomes, and falling titers precede clinical remission. This allows targeted, biomarker-guided therapy rather than empiric immunosuppression for all.",
      "technical_details": "Anti-PLA2R IgG4 antibodies bind phospholipase A2 receptor on podocytes, forming in situ immune complexes. Complement activation (C5b-9 membrane attack complex) causes podocyte injury without inflammatory cell infiltration. GBM response produces 'spikes' between deposits visible on Jones methenamine silver stain."
