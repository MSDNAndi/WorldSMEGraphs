    "summary": "Rapid decline in kidney function over hours to days, defined by rise in serum creatinine and/or decrease in urine output, staged using KDIGO criteria",
    "key_points": [
      "KDIGO definition: Cr rise ≥0.3 mg/dL in 48h, or ≥1.5× baseline in 7 days, or UOP <0.5 mL/kg/h for 6h",
      "Three categories: Pre-renal (hypoperfusion), Intrinsic (parenchymal damage), Post-renal (obstruction)",
      "Pre-renal is most common (40-70%); responds to volume resuscitation",
      "FENa <1% suggests pre-renal; >2% suggests ATN (intrinsic); unreliable with diuretics",
      "Urinalysis: Muddy brown casts = ATN; RBC casts = glomerulonephritis; WBC casts = interstitial nephritis",

    "statement": "Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) is a clinical syndrome characterized by rapid decline in kidney function, diagnosed by standardized KDIGO criteria based on serum creatinine changes and/or urine output, requiring systematic evaluation to identify etiology and guide management.",
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Think of AKI as the kidney losing its filtering capacity suddenly. The body accumulates waste products (creatinine, urea), fluid, and electrolyte imbalances that would normally be excreted. Finding the cause determines whether this is reversible.",
      "key_insight": "The key to AKI evaluation is categorization: Pre-renal (not enough blood flow to kidneys), Intrinsic (damage to kidney tissue itself), or Post-renal (blockage of urine outflow). Each has different treatment - pre-renal needs volume, intrinsic needs supportive care, post-renal needs obstruction relief.",
      "technical_details": "GFR falls when fewer nephrons are functioning or when hemodynamic changes reduce filtration pressure. Serum creatinine rises as generation exceeds excretion. The lag between injury and creatinine rise (12-24 hours) means creatinine underestimates early AKI. Novel biomarkers (NGAL, KIM-1) may detect injury earlier but aren't yet standard of care."
