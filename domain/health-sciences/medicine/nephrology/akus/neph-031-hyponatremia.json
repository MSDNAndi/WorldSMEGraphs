    "title": "Hyponatremia",
    "summary": "Hyponatremia is serum sodium <135 mEq/L, the most common electrolyte disorder. The approach involves determining serum osmolality (true hypotonic vs pseudohyponatremia), then assessing volume status to identify the underlying cause. Treatment varies dramatically based on acuity, symptoms, and etiology, with careful attention to correction rate to prevent osmotic demyelination syndrome.",
    "key_points": [
      "First step: Check serum osmolality to exclude pseudohyponatremia (hyperlipidemia, hyperproteinemia) and translocational (hyperglycemia)",
      "Hypotonic hyponatremia: Classify by volume status (hypovolemic, euvolemic, hypervolemic)",
      "SIADH is most common cause of euvolemic hypotonic hyponatremia",
      "Symptoms correlate with rate of development more than absolute level",
      "Correction rate: <8-10 mEq/L in 24 hours to prevent osmotic demyelination syndrome (ODS)",
      "Severe symptoms (seizures, coma): 3% hypertonic saline 100-150 mL boluses",
      "Check urine Na and osmolality to differentiate causes"
    ],
    "statement": "Hyponatremia reflects an imbalance between water and sodium homeostasis, with the kidney's handling of water (mediated by ADH) being central to most causes. A systematic approach evaluating tonicity and volume status allows accurate diagnosis and guides appropriate therapy while avoiding the serious complication of osmotic demyelination.",
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Think of sodium as 'dissolved' in body water - a low sodium level usually means too much water relative to sodium (dilutional), not too little sodium. The key question is: Why can't the kidney excrete the excess water? Usually, ADH is present when it shouldn't be (SIADH) or the kidney is responding appropriately to a perceived volume deficit.",
      "key_insight": "Urine osmolality is the most useful test: If <100 mOsm/kg, the kidney is appropriately diluting urine (primary polydipsia or reset osmostat). If >100 mOsm/kg, ADH is present (appropriate or inappropriate). Then urine sodium helps distinguish volume depletion (<20 mEq/L) from SIADH (>40 mEq/L).",
      "technical_details": "ADH (vasopressin) is released in response to hyperosmolality or hypovolemia. It binds V2 receptors in collecting duct, inserting aquaporin-2 channels and concentrating urine. In SIADH, ADH is secreted despite normal/low osmolality. Correction too rapidly allows brain cells to shrink (they had adapted by losing organic osmolytes), leading to osmotic demyelination of pontine and extrapontine white matter."
