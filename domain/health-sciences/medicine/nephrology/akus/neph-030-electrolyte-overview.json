    "title": "Electrolyte Disorders Overview",
    "summary": "Framework for understanding electrolyte homeostasis, clinical manifestations of imbalances, and systematic approach to diagnosis and management of sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, and phosphate disorders",
    "key_points": [
      "Sodium disorders reflect water balance, not sodium balance (hyponatremia = too much water relative to sodium)",
      "Potassium disorders are life-threatening; hyperkalemia causes cardiac arrhythmias; hypokalemia causes weakness/arrhythmias",
      "Calcium disorders: Always check ionized Ca or correct for albumin; hypercalcemia causes 'stones, bones, groans, psychiatric overtones'",
      "Magnesium is the 'forgotten electrolyte'; hypomagnesemia causes refractory hypokalemia and hypocalcemia",
      "Phosphate disorders: Hypophosphatemia causes hemolysis and weakness; hyperphosphatemia drives CKD-MBD",
      "Acid-base and electrolytes are interconnected (H+ and K+ shift together; anion gap reflects unmeasured anions)",
      "Always assess volume status, calculate osmolality and anion gap in electrolyte workups"
    ],
    "statement": "Electrolyte disorders encompass abnormalities in serum sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, and phosphate that require systematic evaluation of underlying mechanisms and targeted treatment to prevent life-threatening complications.",
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Electrolytes are like the electrical and chemical messengers of the body. Sodium controls water balance and blood pressure; potassium controls muscle and heart rhythm; calcium controls bones, muscles, and nerves; magnesium is a cofactor for hundreds of enzymes; phosphate is in every cell's energy currency (ATP).",
      "key_insight": "The key to mastering electrolyte disorders is understanding that they rarely occur in isolation. Hypomagnesemia causes refractory hypokalemia; metabolic alkalosis causes hypokalemia; diarrhea causes non-anion gap acidosis with hypokalemia. Always look for the underlying cause and associated abnormalities.",
      "technical_details": "Electrolyte homeostasis involves kidney function (filtration, reabsorption, secretion), hormonal regulation (aldosterone, PTH, ADH, ANP), and cellular distribution. Rapid shifts between intracellular and extracellular compartments (insulin drives K+ into cells; acidosis drives K+ out) explain why serum levels may not reflect total body stores."
