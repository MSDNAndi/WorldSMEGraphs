    "key_points": [
      "No fixed GFR threshold—decisions should be individualized based on symptoms",
      "Classic urgent indications: AEIOU (Acidosis, Electrolytes, Intoxication, Overload, Uremia)",
      "IDEAL trial showed no survival benefit to early (GFR 10-14) vs late (GFR 5-7) initiation",
      "Most patients start when GFR 5-10 mL/min with symptoms",
      "Timely vascular access or PD catheter placement is critical (6+ months before needed)",
      "Shared decision-making should include transplant, conservative management options",
      "Preparation includes access creation, modality education, dietary counseling"
    ],
    "statement": {
      "text": "Dialysis initiation in chronic kidney disease is a clinical decision based on the presence of uremic symptoms, metabolic complications refractory to medical management, or quality of life impairment—not solely on GFR thresholds. The IDEAL trial demonstrated that early initiation (GFR 10-14) provides no survival advantage over symptom-based initiation (typically GFR 5-7). Timely preparation including vascular access creation, modality education, and shared decision-making significantly impacts outcomes.",
      "formal": "Dialysis initiation = Uremic symptoms OR Refractory hyperkalemia/acidosis/overload OR Quality of life impairment NOT based solely on GFR"
    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Starting dialysis is not like starting a medication—it fundamentally changes the patient's life. There's no survival benefit to starting 'early,' so the goal is to delay dialysis until symptoms demand it, while preparing adequately so the transition is smooth. Think of it as an elective decision whenever possible, not an emergency.",
      "key_insight": "The IDEAL trial was a game-changer: it showed that patients randomized to early dialysis (GFR 10-14) had no survival benefit over those starting when symptomatic (GFR 5-7). Many 'early' starters began dialysis feeling well and lost quality of life unnecessarily. Current practice favors symptom-based initiation with excellent preparation.",
      "technical_details": "Preparation timeline: Referral to nephrology at GFR <30; access planning at GFR <20 (fistula creation takes 3-6 months to mature); modality education at GFR 15-20; transplant evaluation if eligible. Urgent indications for dialysis: refractory acidosis (pH <7.1), hyperkalemia (K >6.5 with ECG changes despite medical therapy), volume overload (pulmonary edema refractory to diuretics), uremic encephalopathy, pericarditis, bleeding."
