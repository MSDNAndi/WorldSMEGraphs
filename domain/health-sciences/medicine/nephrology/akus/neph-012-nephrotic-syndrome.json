    "statement": {
      "text": "Nephrotic syndrome is a clinical constellation resulting from increased glomerular permeability to protein: heavy proteinuria (>3.5 g/24h), hypoalbuminemia (<3 g/dL), peripheral edema, and hyperlipidemia. The underlying pathology is podocyte injury, which can result from primary glomerular diseases (minimal change, FSGS, membranous nephropathy) or secondary causes (diabetes, amyloidosis, lupus). Complications include venous thromboembolism, infection, and hyperlipidemia-related cardiovascular disease.",

    },
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "The glomerulus normally keeps protein in the blood. In nephrotic syndrome, the filter leaks, allowing albumin to spill into urine. The liver tries to compensate by making more albumin but also ramps up lipid production (they're made together). Low albumin reduces oncotic pressure, causing fluid to leak into tissues (edema). Lost albumin also carries away antithrombin III, increasing clot risk.",
      "key_insight": "Think of the complications as linked to what's lost or what's overproduced: albumin loss → edema, VTE (lost anticoagulant proteins), infection (lost immunoglobulins); lipid overproduction → hyperlipidemia and accelerated atherosclerosis.",
      "technical_details": "Podocytes are specialized epithelial cells that form the slit diaphragm—the final barrier preventing protein loss. Injury to podocytes (fusion, effacement) causes loss of size/charge selectivity. In selective proteinuria (MCD), only albumin is lost; in non-selective (FSGS, membranous), larger proteins also escape. The liver increases synthesis of albumin, lipoproteins, and coagulation factors, creating a hypercoagulable state."

Urinary loss of antithrombin III, protein C, protein S creates a hypercoagulable state. Loss of immunoglobulins and complement factors increases infection risk.",
