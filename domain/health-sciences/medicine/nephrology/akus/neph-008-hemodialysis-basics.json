    "statement": "Hemodialysis is an extracorporeal blood purification technique using diffusion and convection across a semipermeable membrane to replace kidney function in patients with ESRD or severe AKI.",
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Think of hemodialysis as an external kidney. Blood flows through thousands of tiny hollow fibers in a dialyzer. Waste products diffuse from blood (high concentration) across the membrane into dialysate (low concentration), while excess fluid is removed by pressure-driven ultrafiltration.",
      "key_insight": "Successful hemodialysis depends on three pillars: adequate vascular access (sufficient blood flow), appropriate dialysis prescription (time, frequency, dialyzer size), and proper dry weight assessment (fluid removal without hypotension).",
      "technical_details": "Solute clearance occurs by diffusion (concentration gradient) and convection (solvent drag with ultrafiltration). Small molecules (urea, creatinine) clear efficiently by diffusion; larger molecules (beta-2 microglobulin) require high-flux membranes and convective clearance. Blood flow rates of 350-450 mL/min and dialysate flow of 500-800 mL/min optimize clearance."
