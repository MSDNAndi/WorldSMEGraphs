    "key_points": [
      "CKD defined as eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73m² OR kidney damage markers for ≥3 months",
      "GFR stages: G1 (≥90), G2 (60-89), G3a (45-59), G3b (30-44), G4 (15-29), G5 (<15)",

    "statement": "Chronic Kidney Disease staging uses KDIGO classification combining estimated GFR (G1-G5) and albuminuria (A1-A3) to stratify risk, predict outcomes, and guide the intensity of monitoring and intervention.",
    "explanation": {
      "intuition": "Think of CKD staging as a map showing how far kidney function has declined and how fast it's likely to progress. GFR tells us how much filtration capacity remains; albuminuria tells us about ongoing kidney damage and predicts progression speed.",
      "key_insight": "The KDIGO heat map revolutionized CKD by showing that albuminuria is as important as GFR for prognosis. A patient with GFR 55 (G3a) and heavy proteinuria (A3) has HIGHER risk than someone with GFR 25 (G4) and minimal proteinuria (A1). Treatment intensity should match risk.",
      "technical_details": "eGFR is estimated using CKD-EPI creatinine equation, which adjusts for age, sex, and (optionally) race. Cystatin C-based equations may be more accurate in some populations. Albuminuria is measured as urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR) from spot urine. True GFR can be measured with iohexol or iothalamate clearance but rarely needed clinically."
