# WorldSMEGraphs Global Domain Hierarchy
# =============================================================================
# 
# Purpose: Defines the authoritative, ontologically rigorous domain hierarchy
# for all knowledge organization in WorldSMEGraphs.
#
# Design Principles:
#   1. ONTOLOGICAL RIGOR: Concepts belong to their NATIVE domain (origin),
#      not their application domains
#   2. SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH: One authoritative location per concept
#   3. CROSS-DOMAIN LINKING: Applications create links, not copies
#   4. EXTENSIBILITY: Hierarchy supports easy addition of new domains
#   5. STANDARD ALIGNMENT: Based on established taxonomies (UNESCO, LOC, DDC)

# CORE DESIGN PRINCIPLES
# =============================================================================

principles:
  native_domain_placement:
    description: >
      Every concept belongs to exactly one NATIVE domain - the field where
      it was originally developed, even if heavily used elsewhere.
    examples:
      - concept: Category Theory
        native_domain: mathematics/pure-mathematics/category-theory
        application_domains:
          - computer-science/programming-paradigms/functional-programming
          - physics/quantum-physics/quantum-mechanics
      - concept: Linear Algebra
        native_domain: mathematics/pure-mathematics/algebra/linear-algebra
        application_domains:
          - computer-science/artificial-intelligence/machine-learning
          - physics/classical-mechanics
          - economics/econometrics
      - concept: Calculus
        native_domain: mathematics/pure-mathematics/analysis/calculus
        application_domains:
          - physics/classical-mechanics
          - economics/mathematical-economics
          - engineering/all-branches

  single_source_of_truth:
    description: >
      AKUs are created ONLY in the native domain. Other domains 
      LINK to these AKUs; they do not duplicate content.
    implementation:
      native_domain: Contains full AKU definitions
      application_domain: Contains cross-domain references and application context

  cross_domain_linking:
    description: >
      Applications and uses of concepts in other domains are expressed
      through semantic links, not content duplication.
    link_types:
      - uses: "Application domain uses concept from source domain"
      - applies: "Concept is applied in this context"
      - extends: "Domain extends concept with additional structure"
      - specializes: "Domain-specific specialization of concept"

# =============================================================================
# TOP-LEVEL DOMAIN TAXONOMY
# =============================================================================
# 
# Level 0: Root domains organized by UNESCO/ISCED-F classification
# with adjustments for WorldSMEGraphs practical needs
#
# These are the broadest categorizations of human knowledge.

# CATEGORY THEORY SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS

category_theory_placement:
  authoritative_location:
    path: formal-sciences/mathematics/pure-mathematics/category-theory
    rationale: >
      Category theory is a branch of pure mathematics developed by 
      Samuel Eilenberg and Saunders Mac Lane in 1945 for algebraic topology.
      It is fundamentally mathematical, providing abstract structure for
      relating different areas of mathematics.

    notes: >
      The current repository uses 'functional-theory' as a legacy path.
      The new hierarchy uses 'functional-programming' under programming-paradigms.
      During migration, functional programming application AKUs will be created
      at the new canonical location.

  directory_structure:
    description: >
      The domain hierarchy maps directly to file system directories
    notes:
      - Top-level domains become direct subdirectories of domain/
      - Subdomain hierarchy creates nested directories
      - Cross-domain links are implemented in AKU files, not directory structure

# VALIDATION RULES
# =============================================================================

validation:
  rules:
    - name: single-native-domain
      description: Every concept must have exactly one native domain
      check: Each AKU has a unique domain_path
    
    - name: valid-cross-references
      description: All cross-domain references must point to valid AKUs
      check: Target AKU exists at referenced path
    
    - name: hierarchy-consistency
      description: Directory structure matches this hierarchy
      check: domain directories exist for all defined paths
    
    - name: no-concept-duplication
      description: Concepts are not duplicated across domains
      check: AKUs with same semantic meaning exist only once
    
    - name: proper-linking
      description: Application domains link to, not copy, native concepts
      check: Cross-domain references use link types, not content duplication
