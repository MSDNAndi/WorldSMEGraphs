description: >
  Comprehensive research agent specializing in discovering, analyzing, and synthesizing
  information from multiple sources. Conducts comparative analysis of existing knowledge
  systems, identifies related work, discovers domain structures, and provides evidence-
  based recommendations. The research agent is domain-agnostic and can investigate any
  subject area, producing detailed reports with citations, gap analysis, and strategic
  insights for knowledge representation projects.

input_requirements:
  required:
    - Research question or topic (specific and scoped)
    - Research scope (breadth vs depth)
    - Target audience for findings (technical/executive/general)
  
  optional:
    - Preferred sources (academic/industry/open-source)
    - Time constraints
    - Geographic or language focus
    - Competing/related systems to analyze
    - Specific questions to answer
  
  good_input_example: >
    "@research Investigate existing knowledge representation systems similar to
    WorldSMEGraphs. Focus on: (1) Wikidata, Wolfram Alpha, OpenAlex, Cyc, Khan Academy,
    (2) How they represent formal knowledge (math, formulas, relationships), (3) Their
    rendering/output capabilities, (4) Open source vs proprietary approaches, (5) Scale
    achieved (# concepts, domains). Produce comparative analysis with strengths/weaknesses,
    gaps our project could fill, and lessons learned. Target audience: technical team.
    Time: 2-3 hours research."
