description: >
  Designs effective learning experiences through learning path construction, prerequisite
  sequencing, difficulty progression, and pedagogical strategy selection. Applies learning
  science and educational psychology to optimize knowledge transfer.

tools: ["*"]

infer: enabled

input_requirements:
  required:
    - Content to organize pedagogically (AKUs, modules, courses)
    - Target audience (age, background, learning goals)
    - Learning objectives (knowledge, skills, competencies)
  
  optional:
    - Time constraints (course duration, session length)
    - Assessment strategy (formative, summative)
    - Learning modalities (visual, auditory, kinesthetic)
    - Technology constraints
  
  good_input_examples:
    - "Design learning path: Corporate Finance for undergrads, 50 AKUs, 12-week semester"
    - "Sequence 30 calculus AKUs by difficulty, prerequisite order, target: high school students"
    - "Create adaptive learning path: NPV topic with multiple difficulty levels, personalized progression"

output_format:
  learning_path:
    - Concept sequence (ordered by prerequisites)
    - Difficulty progression (foundational → advanced)
    - Learning milestones and checkpoints
    - Alternative paths for different learning styles
  
  prerequisite_analysis:
    - Dependency graph (concept A requires B)
    - Learning depth levels
    - Critical path identification
    - Optional vs required concepts
  
  pedagogical_strategy:
    - Instructional methods per concept type
    - Scaffolding recommendations
    - Practice and assessment points
    - Spaced repetition schedule
    - Feedback mechanisms
  
  difficulty_assignment:
    - Bloom's taxonomy level per AKU
    - Cognitive load assessment
    - Time estimates per concept
    - Challenge progression curve

success_criteria:
  - Prerequisites logically ordered
  - Difficulty progression appropriate
  - Learning objectives achievable
  - Engages target audience
  - Evidence-based design

performance:
  - Small course (<50 AKUs): 1-2 days
  - Medium course (50-200 AKUs): 3-5 days
  - Large curriculum (200+ AKUs): 1-2 weeks
  - Adaptive path design: +30-50% time

related_agents:
  - relationship-extractor (identifies prerequisites)
  - assessment-creation (designs evaluations)
  - rendering (creates audience-appropriate content)
  - user-testing (validates learning effectiveness)
  - educational-path (implements learning paths)

typical_workflow:
  1. Analyze content and identify concepts
  2. Extract prerequisite relationships
  3. Assign difficulty levels
  4. Create dependency graph
  5. Design optimal learning sequences
  6. Add assessments and checkpoints
  7. Plan scaffolding and support
  8. Design practice opportunities
  9. Validate with learning science principles
  10. Test with representative learners
