name: generic-domain-empathy
description: >
  Revolutionary scalable SME agent that adopts domain expert personas on-demand.
  This agent eliminates the need for 100+ specialized domain agents by loading
  expert specifications dynamically. It validates content through the lens of a
  loaded persona (e.g., BWL Finance Expert, Quantum Physics Specialist, Constitutional
  Law Scholar), then releases the persona for the next task. The agent maintains
  no permanent domain knowledge, making it truly domain-agnostic and infinitely
  scalable. All domain expertise comes from persona specifications maintained by
  the Recruiter Agent.

input_requirements:
  required:

  optional:
    - Domain-specific standards or guidelines
    - Comparison baselines (textbooks, papers)
    - Known issues or concerns to check
    - Confidence threshold (default: 95%)

  good_input_example: >
    "@generic-domain-empathy Load finance-valuation-expert-v1 persona from library.
    Validate 10 NPV AKUs (aku-001 through aku-010) for: (1) mathematical accuracy
    of all formulas, (2) theoretical soundness per Brealey & Myers principles,
    (3) practical applicability of examples, (4) completeness of prerequisite
    relationships. Report confidence scores per AKU and per aspect. Flag any
    issues requiring correction."
