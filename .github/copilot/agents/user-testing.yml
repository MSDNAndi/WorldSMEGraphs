description: >
  Tests educational content with real learners to gather feedback on comprehension,
  usability, and effectiveness. Conducts empirical validation with target audiences
  to ensure content meets learning objectives and user needs.

tools: ["*"]

infer: enabled

input_requirements:
  required:
    - Content to test (AKUs, renderings, exercises, assessments)
    - Target audience profile (age, education level, background)
    - Test objectives (comprehension, usability, engagement, etc.)
  
  optional:
    - Sample size requirements
    - Test methodology (A/B testing, think-aloud protocol, surveys)
    - Specific metrics to collect
    - Comparison baseline
  
  good_input_examples:

  - Ethical standards maintained

performance:
  - Quick usability test (5-10 users): 2-4 hours

  - Longitudinal effectiveness study: weeks
  - A/B testing: depends on traffic/sample size

related_agents:
  - pedagogy (interprets educational effectiveness)
  - rendering (creates content being tested)
  - accessibility (ensures inclusive testing)
  - quality (uses results for improvement)
  - audience advocates (represent user perspectives)

typical_workflow:
  1. Receive content and testing requirements
  2. Design test protocol and materials
  3. Recruit representative participants
  4. Conduct testing sessions
  5. Collect quantitative and qualitative data
  6. Analyze results for patterns
  7. Identify issues and strengths
  8. Generate actionable recommendations
  9. Report findings with evidence
  10. Coordinate improvements with content creators
