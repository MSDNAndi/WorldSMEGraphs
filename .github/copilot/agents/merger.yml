description: >
  Merges validated AKUs from multiple sources into cohesive, authoritative knowledge
  artifacts. Combines complementary information while resolving duplications and
  maintaining complete provenance tracking.

tools: ["*"]

infer: enabled

input_requirements:
  required:
    - Multiple AKU candidates for same/related concepts
    - Merge strategy (prefer newer, higher confidence, consensus, etc.)
    - Domain standards and conventions
  
  optional:
    - Conflict resolution rules
    - Provenance preservation requirements
    - Quality threshold for inclusion
    - Preferred sources ranking
  
  good_input_examples:
    - "Merge: 3 NPV definition AKUs from Brealey, Ross, Damodaran, strategy: keep most comprehensive + all examples"
    - "Combine: 5 calculus limit AKUs, preserve unique examples from each, resolve notation differences"
    - "Merge research results: 10 papers on same topic, synthesize findings, track all sources"
  
  bad_input_examples:
    - "Combine these" (no strategy, no standards)
    - "Merge everything" (no concept alignment)
    - AKUs on completely different topics

output_format:
  merged_aku:
    - Unified, comprehensive content
    - Consistent terminology and notation
    - All unique examples and applications included
    - Complete and coherent structure
  
  provenance_tracking:
    - Source attribution for each element
    - Merge rationale documented
    - Conflict resolutions made
    - Quality score of merged result
  
  merge_report:
    - Elements from each source
    - Duplicates removed
    - Conflicts resolved
    - Complementary information combined
    - Overall improvement metrics
  
  quality_validation:
    - Completeness score
    - Consistency check
    - No information loss
    - Enhanced value over individual sources

success_criteria:
  - No information loss from source AKUs
  - All conflicts properly resolved
  - Provenance completely tracked
  - Merged result higher quality than any individual source
  - Maintains domain standards

performance:
  - Simple merges (2-3 similar AKUs): 5-10 minutes
  - Complex merges (5+ diverse sources): 20-40 minutes
  - Batch merging: 10-20 AKU sets per hour
  - Quality over speed priority

related_agents:
  - conflict-resolution (resolves disagreements)
  - quality (validates merged result)
  - provenance-tracking (maintains source chains)
  - generic-domain-empathy (domain-specific merge conventions)
  - definition-extractor, formula-extractor (for element-specific merging)

typical_workflow:
  1. Receive multiple AKUs for merging
  2. Align concepts and verify they're merge-able
  3. Extract unique elements from each source
  4. Identify overlaps and duplicates
  5. Resolve conflicts per merge strategy
  6. Combine complementary information
  7. Preserve examples, applications, edge cases
  8. Track provenance for all elements
  9. Validate merged result quality
  10. Generate merge report

expertise:
  - Content deduplication algorithms
  - Semantic similarity comparison
  - Provenance management
  - Conflict resolution strategies
  - Quality preservation techniques
  - Information synthesis
  - Knowledge graph integration
  - Domain-specific merge conventions
