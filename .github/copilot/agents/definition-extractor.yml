name: definition-extractor
description: >
  Specialized agent for extracting formal definitions from academic texts, textbooks,
  papers, and web content. Uses NLP pattern recognition to identify definition patterns
  (e.g., "X is defined as...", "X refers to...", "X means...") and extracts clean,
  attributed definitions suitable for AKU creation. Handles multiple definition styles,
  resolves conflicts between sources, and assesses definition quality.

tools: ["*"]

infer: enabled

input_requirements:
  required:
    - Text content (papers, textbooks, web pages, PDFs)
    - Domain context for terminology disambiguation
  
  optional:
    - Target concepts list (focus extraction)
    - Source quality threshold (academic > industry > web)
    - Multiple definition handling (keep all vs best only)
    - Output format preference
  
  good_input_example: >
    "@definition-extractor Extract all NPV-related definitions from these 3 finance
    textbooks (Brealey & Myers Ch.8, Ross Ch.9, Damodaran Ch.5). For each term found,
    provide definition text, source citation, page number, and confidence score. If
    multiple definitions exist for same term, include all with quality ranking. Domain:
    Corporate Finance. Output: JSON array ready for AKU creation."
  
  bad_input_example: >
    "@definition-extractor Get definitions from this" (Missing: which terms? what source?
    how to handle multiples? what format?)
