good_input_examples:
  - >
    @localization Adapt the NPV "lemonade stand" worked example from US context to German Gymnasium
    students. Replace US currency, business context, and cultural references while maintaining the
    mathematical rigor and NPV calculation methodology. Source: npv-003-worked-example.md
  
  - >
    @localization Review all BWL Marketing AKUs for cultural appropriateness in Japanese business context.
    Flag any examples, case studies, or assumptions that reflect Western-centric business practices and
    suggest culturally-appropriate Japanese alternatives. Preserve academic concepts but adapt applications.
  
  - >
    @localization Transform the "cookie vs. toy" time-value-of-money rendering for German Kindergarten
    (ages 3-5). Current version uses US cultural references (cookies, specific toys). Need German-appropriate
    items, measurement systems, and pedagogical approaches. Maintain core concept of delayed gratification.

bad_input_examples:
  - >
    @localization Translate this to German
    (PROBLEM: Localization is not translation - needs cultural adaptation, target audience, content type)
  
  - >
    @localization Make this work in other countries
    (PROBLEM: No specific target culture, no source content provided, vague requirements)

typical_workflow:
  1. Receive source content with target culture specification
  2. Analyze content for cultural elements requiring adaptation
  3. Research target culture educational norms, business practices, common references
  4. Identify measurement systems, currency, date formats for target region
  5. Adapt examples and scenarios to culturally-relevant equivalents
  6. Adjust pedagogical approach to match educational culture
  7. Review for cultural sensitivity and inappropriate stereotypes
  8. Preserve all mathematical formulas and scientific accuracy
  9. Document all changes with rationale for future reference
  10. Flag for native speaker validation if deep cultural adaptation
  11. Update localization metadata in AKU
  12. Coordinate with multi-lingual-validation for quality assurance

usage_examples:
  - example: "US to German business example adaptation"
    prompt: >
      @localization Adapt NPV corporate investment example from US Fortune 500 context to German
      Mittelstand (medium-sized enterprise) context. Replace US-specific business practices,
      financial structures, and decision-making processes with German equivalents.
    expected_output: >
      Adapted example: Changed from NYSE-listed corporation to family-owned Mittelstand firm,
      replaced shareholder-centric decision to stakeholder model including workers' council
      (Betriebsrat), adjusted financial metrics to German accounting standards (HGB), changed
      currency to EUR with realistic German business financials. NPV formula and calculations
      preserved exactly.
  
  - example: "Kindergarten rendering cultural adaptation"
    prompt: >
      @localization Transform the US "cookie vs. toy" time preference rendering for German Kindergarten
      ages 3-5. Current version has US cultural elements. Need German-appropriate items, teaching style.
    expected_output: >
      Replaced "cookie" with "Keks" (more culturally appropriate German term), changed "toy store"
      to "Spielzeugladen", adapted teaching approach to German early childhood pedagogy emphasizing
      social learning and forest kindergarten concepts. Maintained delayed gratification core concept.
  
  - example: "Mathematical example localization"
    prompt: >
      @localization Adapt compound interest word problem from US context (buying car, dollars, miles)
      to Japanese context. Target audience: Japanese high school students.
    expected_output: >
      Changed scenario from buying car to saving for university entrance exam prep courses (more
      culturally relevant goal for Japanese students). Converted USD to JPY with realistic amounts,
      changed distance from miles to kilometers. Adapted interest rates to reflect Japanese banking
      norms. Formula and calculation methodology preserved exactly.
  
  - example: "Culturally-sensitive review"
    prompt: >
      @localization Review all Economics microeconomics AKUs for cultural appropriateness in Chinese
      market. Flag any Western-centric assumptions about markets, competition, or economic behavior.
    expected_output: >
      Flagged 7 issues: 3 examples assume free-market competition (adapt for socialist market economy),
      2 use individualistic consumer behavior models (adjust for collectivist preferences), 2 reference
      Western brands/companies (replace with Chinese equivalents like Alibaba, Tencent). Preserved all
      economic theory but recommended application examples be revised.
  
  - example: "Measurement system conversion"
    prompt: >
      @localization Convert all Physics mechanics AKUs from Imperial units (feet, pounds, Fahrenheit)
      to Metric (meters, kilograms, Celsius) for European audience. Ensure formula consistency.
    expected_output: >
      Converted 45 examples: all distances to meters, masses to kg, temperatures to Celsius. Updated
      constants (g = 32.2 ft/s² → 9.81 m/s²). Verified all formula outputs mathematically equivalent.
      No pedagogical changes needed - metric system already standard in European physics education.

      @localization Create Japanese translations for business/economics AKUs. Ensure kanji terminology aligns with
      Japanese business textbooks. Cultural adaptation: collectivist examples vs. individualist, lifetime employment
      context, keiretsu systems. Validate with native Japanese business professor.
  - >
      @localization Translate elementary math AKUs to Arabic with right-to-left layout considerations. Ensure number
      formatting matches Arabic conventions (١٢٣ vs 123). Verify mathematical notation internationally standard.
