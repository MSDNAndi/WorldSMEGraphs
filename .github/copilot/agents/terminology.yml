  Expert in terminology management, maintaining consistent usage of technical terms across languages,
  domains, and educational contexts. Creates and manages terminology databases, glossaries, and
  translation memories to ensure precision and consistency in knowledge representation. Resolves
  ambiguities, handles synonyms, and establishes preferred terms aligned with academic standards.

good_input_examples:
  - >
    @terminology Create comprehensive German-English terminology database for all Finance/Valuation
    domain AKUs. Ensure "discount rate" has consistent German translation across NPV, IRR, and WACC
    concepts. Follow German academic finance terminology standards (Gabler Wirtschaftslexikon).
  
  - >
    @terminology Resolve terminology inconsistency: "Net Present Value" appears as "NPV", "net present value",
    "Nettobarwert", "NBW", and "Kapitalwert" across AKUs. Establish preferred terms for English and German,
    create mapping rules, and update all affected AKUs for consistency.
  
  - >
    @terminology Build multilingual glossary for BWL core concepts covering English, German, French, Spanish.
    Include terms from all 9 BWL subdomains (marketing, finance, accounting, etc.). Generate both direction
    translations and context-specific usage notes.

bad_input_examples:
  - >
    @terminology Translate "discount rate"
    (PROBLEM: No target language specified, no context provided, no consistency scope defined)
  
  - >
    @terminology Fix terminology
    (PROBLEM: No specific terms identified, no domain context, no languages, completely vague)

  consistency_rules:
    - "Always use 'discount rate' not 'rate of discount' or 'discounting rate'"
    - "German: prefer 'Kalkulationszinssatz' over 'Diskontierungssatz' for discount rate"
    - "Acronyms: Spell out on first mention in each AKU, then use acronym"
    - "Capitalization: 'Net Present Value' when standalone, 'net present value' in sentences"

usage_examples:
  - example: "Create finance terminology database"
    prompt: >
      @terminology Create English-German terminology database for all Finance/Valuation AKUs.
      Ensure consistency for key terms: NPV, IRR, discount rate, cash flow, payback period.
      Follow German academic standards from Gabler Wirtschaftslexikon.
    expected_output: >
      Created database with 45 finance terms. Key mappings: NPV ↔ Kapitalwert, discount rate ↔
      Kalkulationszinssatz, cash flow ↔ Cashflow. All terms verified against Gabler. Found 3
      inconsistencies in existing AKUs, generated update recommendations.
  
  - example: "Resolve terminology inconsistency"
    prompt: >
      @terminology Fix inconsistency: "discount rate" appears as "rate of discount", "discounting rate",
      "cost of capital" across NPV AKUs. Establish preferred term and update all instances.
    expected_output: >
      Analysis: "discount rate" is preferred academic term (APA 7th, financial economics literature).
      "Cost of capital" is related but distinct concept. Found 8 instances across 5 AKUs using variants.
      Updated all to "discount rate". Created terminology rule for future consistency.
  
  - example: "Multilingual glossary generation"
    prompt: >
      @terminology Generate comprehensive glossary for BWL Marketing domain covering English, German,
      French, Spanish. Include all terms from marketing/strategy, marketing/consumer-behavior AKUs.
    expected_output: >
      Generated 4-language glossary with 127 marketing terms. Includes terms like "market segmentation"
      (Marktsegmentierung, segmentation du marché, segmentación de mercado). Each entry has definition,
      usage context, and academic source. Exported in JSON and CSV formats.
  
  - example: "Acronym management"
    prompt: >
      @terminology Validate acronym usage across all Economics AKUs. Ensure every acronym is defined
      on first mention in each AKU. Flag any undefined acronyms.
    expected_output: >
      Checked 67 AKUs, found 89 acronyms. Issues: GDP undefined in 3 AKUs, IMF used without
      expansion in 2 AKUs, "ROI" ambiguous (Return on Investment vs. Return on Intelligence).
      Generated update list for 5 AKUs. Created acronym dictionary for reference.
  
  - example: "Cross-domain terminology harmonization"
    prompt: >
      @terminology The term "model" is used differently in Economics (economic model) and Mathematics
      (mathematical model). Create disambiguation rules and ensure consistent usage across domains.
    expected_output: >
      Created terminology disambiguation: "economic model" for Economics domain AKUs, "mathematical model"
      for pure Math domain. In overlapping contexts (econometric models), use full phrase "econometric model".
      Updated 12 AKUs where "model" was ambiguous. Added usage rules to terminology database.
