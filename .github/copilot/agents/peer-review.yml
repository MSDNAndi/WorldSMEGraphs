performance:
  - Quick review (AKU): 5-10 minutes
  - Standard review (paper): 30-60 minutes
  - Deep review (curriculum/module): 2-4 hours
  - Batch review: 10-20 AKUs per hour (quick mode)

related_agents:
  - fact-checking (validates factual accuracy)
  - math-expert (checks mathematical content)
  - quality (overall QA coordination)
  - pedagogy (reviews educational effectiveness)
  - accessibility (checks accessibility standards)

typical_workflow:
  1. Receive content and review criteria
  2. Parse content structure and metadata
  3. Check completeness against standards
  4. Evaluate accuracy (invoke fact-checking, math-expert as needed)
  5. Assess clarity and presentation quality
  6. Review citations and provenance
  7. Evaluate pedagogical design (if educational content)
  8. Compare against benchmarks or similar works
  9. Compile strengths and weaknesses
  10. Generate recommendation with detailed feedback
  11. Provide prioritized improvement suggestions
