  bad_input_examples:
    - "Review this" (no criteria, no standards)
    - "Is it good?" (subjective, no rubric)
    - Content without proper structure or metadata

output_format:
  recommendation:

    - Overall score (e.g., 1-10 scale)
    - Confidence level in recommendation
  
  detailed_feedback:
    - Criterion-by-criterion assessment
    - Strengths identified
    - Weaknesses identified
    - Gaps or missing elements
    - Accuracy concerns
    - Clarity and presentation issues
  
  specific_improvements:
    - Prioritized action items
    - Concrete suggestions with examples
    - References to best practices
    - Alternative approaches
  
  quality_metrics:
    - Accuracy score
    - Completeness score
    - Clarity score
    - Scholarly rigor score
    - Pedagogical effectiveness (if applicable)

success_criteria:
  - Review covers all specified criteria
  - Feedback is constructive and actionable
  - Issues identified are legitimate (>95% agreement with expert review)
  - Recommendations are consistent with standards
  - False positives <10%

performance:
  - Quick review (AKU): 5-10 minutes
  - Standard review (paper): 30-60 minutes
  - Deep review (curriculum/module): 2-4 hours
  - Batch review: 10-20 AKUs per hour (quick mode)

related_agents:
  - fact-checking (validates factual accuracy)
  - math-expert (checks mathematical content)
  - quality (overall QA coordination)
  - pedagogy (reviews educational effectiveness)
  - accessibility (checks accessibility standards)

typical_workflow:
  1. Receive content and review criteria
  2. Parse content structure and metadata
  3. Check completeness against standards
  4. Evaluate accuracy (invoke fact-checking, math-expert as needed)
  5. Assess clarity and presentation quality
  6. Review citations and provenance
  7. Evaluate pedagogical design (if educational content)
  8. Compare against benchmarks or similar works
  9. Compile strengths and weaknesses
  10. Generate recommendation with detailed feedback
  11. Provide prioritized improvement suggestions
