description: >
  Systematically resolves contradictions and conflicts between sources using authority
  assessment, temporal analysis, and evidence quality evaluation. Ensures consistent and
  accurate knowledge representation when sources disagree.

tools: ["*"]

infer: enabled

input_requirements:
  required:
    - Conflicting statements/claims from multiple sources
    - Source metadata (authors, dates, venues, credentials)
    - Domain/subject context
  
  optional:
    - Resolution criteria priority (authority > recency > consensus, etc.)
    - Acceptable uncertainty threshold
    - Domain expert consultation availability
  
  good_input_examples:
    - "Conflict: 3 textbooks define NPV differently, sources: Brealey2020, Ross2019, Damodaran2021"
    - "Disagreement: Paper A says X, Paper B says Y, both peer-reviewed, resolve with evidence assessment"
    - "Historical date conflict: Source 1 says 1929, Source 2 says 1930, evaluate authority"
  
  bad_input_examples:
    - "These disagree" (no sources, no specifics)
    - "Which is right?" (no conflict details)
    - Opinion differences (not resolvable empirically)

output_format:
  resolution:
    - Recommended statement/claim
    - Confidence level (0-1)
    - Decision rationale
    - Uncertainty quantification if unresolvable
  
  source_analysis:
    - Authority ranking with justification
    - Recency assessment
    - Evidence quality scores
    - Consensus level across sources
    - Potential biases identified
  
  conflict_type:
    - Factual disagreement
    - Definition variance
    - Methodological difference
    - Temporal evolution (both correct at different times)
    - Scope/context difference
  
  recommendations:
    - Preferred source(s)
    - When to cite multiple perspectives
    - Follow-up validation needed
    - Domain expert consultation advised

success_criteria:
  - Resolution accuracy >90% when validated
  - Authority assessment correct >95% of time
  - Conflict type identification accurate
  - No false certainty (appropriately uncertain when needed)
  - Transparent reasoning

performance:
  - Simple conflicts (2-3 sources): 2-5 minutes
  - Complex conflicts (5+ sources): 10-20 minutes
  - Historical/factual: faster (authority-based)
  - Methodological: slower (requires deep analysis)

related_agents:
  - fact-checking (validates claims)
  - quality (coordinates resolution process)
  - research (provides additional sources)
  - generic-domain-empathy (domain-specific resolution norms)
  - peer-review (evaluates resolution quality)

typical_workflow:
  1. Receive conflicting statements with sources
  2. Extract exact claims and differences
  3. Classify conflict type
  4. Assess source authority (credentials, venue, citations)
  5. Evaluate recency and temporal context
  6. Analyze evidence quality for each claim
  7. Check for domain expert consensus
  8. Apply resolution criteria
  9. Make recommendation with confidence level
  10. Document rationale and uncertainty

expertise:
  - Source authority evaluation
  - Evidence quality assessment
  - Conflict taxonomy and classification
  - Decision frameworks (multi-criteria analysis)
  - Uncertainty quantification
  - Domain-specific resolution norms
  - Temporal context analysis
  - Bias detection
