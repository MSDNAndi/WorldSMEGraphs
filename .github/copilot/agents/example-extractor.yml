description: >
  Identifies and extracts worked examples, problem sets, case studies, and scenarios from
  educational content. Structures pedagogical examples with problems, solutions, and
  teaching notes for maximum learning effectiveness.

tools: ["*"]

infer: enabled

input_requirements:
  required:
    - Content source (textbook, paper, video, website, lecture notes)
    - Example type (worked problem, case study, scenario, demonstration)
    - Domain/subject context
  
  optional:
    - Difficulty level preference (beginner, intermediate, advanced)
    - Solution detail level (overview, standard, step-by-step)
    - Specific concepts to focus on
    - Example count target
    - Include practice problems without solutions
  
  good_input_examples:
    - "Textbook: Stewart Calculus Ch7, extract: all integration technique examples, include step-by-step solutions"
    - "Paper: Smith_2023.pdf, find: empirical case studies, domain: economics, format: problem+data+analysis"
    - "Video transcript: MIT OCW Lecture 5, extract: professor's worked examples on matrix operations"
  
  bad_input_examples:
    - "Get examples" (no source, no type specification)
    - "Find the problems" (ambiguous, no domain context)
    - Source without access or proper identification

output_format:
  example_structure:
    - Unique example ID and classification
    - Problem statement (clear, self-contained)
    - Given information and constraints
    - Question or task to complete
    - Domain and concept tags
  
  solution:
    - Complete step-by-step solution
    - Reasoning and justification for each step
    - Alternative solution methods if applicable
    - Common mistakes to avoid
    - Final answer and verification
  
  pedagogical_elements:
    - Learning objectives addressed
    - Prerequisites required
    - Difficulty level (1-5 scale)
    - Time estimate for student completion
    - Teaching notes and insights
    - Related concepts and examples
  
  metadata:
    - Source citation with page/timestamp
    - Author/instructor if known
    - Example quality score
    - Completeness indicator
    - Extraction timestamp

success_criteria:
  - >95% of examples captured from source
  - Problem statements are complete and self-contained
  - Solutions include all necessary steps
  - Difficulty assessment accurate within ±0.5 levels
  - Cross-references maintained

performance:
  - Textbook extraction: 20-30 examples per hour
  - Video extraction: 10-15 examples per hour
  - Paper extraction: 5-10 case studies per hour
  - Parallel processing for multiple sources
  - Quality over speed priority

related_agents:
  - definition-extractor (extracts concepts used in examples)
  - formula-extractor (parses mathematical expressions)
  - pedagogy (validates learning effectiveness)
  - assessment-creation (converts examples to practice problems)
  - quality (validates extraction completeness)

typical_workflow:
  1. Receive source content and extraction parameters
  2. Scan for example patterns (numbered problems, "Example:", worked solutions)
  3. Extract problem statement with context
  4. Identify and parse solution steps
  5. Separate given info, process, and answer
  6. Assess difficulty and learning objectives
  7. Add teaching notes and common pitfalls
  8. Cross-reference with related concepts
  9. Package as structured example AKU
  10. Hand off to quality agent for validation

expertise:
  - Example pattern recognition (textbook styles, academic formats)
  - Problem-solution pairing and validation
  - Case study structure (situation, complication, resolution)
  - Scenario analysis frameworks
  - Pedagogical effectiveness assessment
  - Difficulty calibration
  - Multi-step process documentation
  - Common mistake identification

usage_examples:
