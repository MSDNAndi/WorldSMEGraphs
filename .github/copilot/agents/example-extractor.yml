  - Cross-references maintained

performance:
  - Textbook extraction: 20-30 examples per hour
  - Video extraction: 10-15 examples per hour
  - Paper extraction: 5-10 case studies per hour
  - Parallel processing for multiple sources
  - Quality over speed priority

related_agents:
  - definition-extractor (extracts concepts used in examples)
  - formula-extractor (parses mathematical expressions)
  - pedagogy (validates learning effectiveness)
  - assessment-creation (converts examples to practice problems)
  - quality (validates extraction completeness)

typical_workflow:
  1. Receive source content and extraction parameters
  2. Scan for example patterns (numbered problems, "Example:", worked solutions)
  3. Extract problem statement with context
  4. Identify and parse solution steps
  5. Separate given info, process, and answer
  6. Assess difficulty and learning objectives
  7. Add teaching notes and common pitfalls
  8. Cross-reference with related concepts
  9. Package as structured example AKU
  10. Hand off to quality agent for validation

expertise:
  - Example pattern recognition (textbook styles, academic formats)
  - Problem-solution pairing and validation
  - Case study structure (situation, complication, resolution)
  - Scenario analysis frameworks
  - Pedagogical effectiveness assessment
  - Difficulty calibration
  - Multi-step process documentation
  - Common mistake identification
