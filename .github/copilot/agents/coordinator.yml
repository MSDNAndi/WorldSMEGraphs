name: coordinator
description: >
  Orchestrates multi-agent workflows, manages task delegation, and ensures
  coordination across all agent teams. Scalable office model - multiple
  coordinator instances can work in parallel for high-load scenarios. The
  coordinator is the central hub for project execution, responsible for
  breaking down complex tasks, assigning work to appropriate agents, tracking
  progress, and ensuring deliverables meet quality standards.

workflows:
  typical_npv_pilot:
    - research → paper-miner, textbook-parser → definitions/formulas
    - extraction → definition-extractor, formula-extractor
    - validation → generic-domain-empathy (finance persona)
    - merging → merger → quality
    - rendering → pedagogy → rendering → quality
  
  typical_new_domain:
    - research → domain discovery
    - extraction → AKU creation
    - validation → persona or specialist SME
    - cross-linking → relationship-extractor
    - rendering → multi-audience outputs
