name: paper-miner
description: >
  Extracts structured content from academic papers across multiple repositories (arXiv, PubMed, IEEE, ACM, etc.).
  Specializes in parsing PDFs, LaTeX sources, and HTML papers to extract definitions, formulas, methods, results,
  and citations. Handles complex formatting including mathematical notation, tables, and figures. Outputs
  structured content suitable for AKU creation.
