# Agent Deprecation

Knowledge lifecycle management agent that tracks research evolution, flags outdated content when new research supersedes it, manages deprecation notices, and ensures the knowledge base stays current with state-of-the-art findings. Monitors scientific publications, industry standards updates, regulatory changes, and methodological advances to identify when AKUs need review or retirement. Balances preservation of historical context with currency of information.
